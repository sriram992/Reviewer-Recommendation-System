Email:{us11,barathram,msm}@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract An assessment of electrocardiogram (ECG) signal quality has become an unavoidable rst step in most holter and ambulatory ECG signal analysis applications. In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically detection and classi cation of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major steps: moving average lter, blocking, feature extraction, and multistage decision-tree algorithm. In the proposed method, the dynamic amplitude range and autocorrelation maximum peak features are extracted for each block. In the rst decision stage, a amplitude-dependent decision rule is used for detecting the presence of low-frequency (LF) noise (including, baseline wander (BW) and abrupt change (ABC) artifacts) and the high-frequency (HF) noise (including, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts). In the second decision stage, the proposed method further classi es the LF noise into a BW noise or a ABC noise using the local dynamic amplitude range feature. The HF noise is classi ed into a PLI noise or a muscle noise using the local autocorrelation maximum peak feature. The proposed detection and classi cation method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals. Results show that the method can achieve an average sensitivity (Se) of 97.88%, positive productivity (+P) of 91.18% and accuracy of 89.06%. I. INTRODUCTION Recently, wearable cardiac health care monitoring de- vices enable continuous recording of ECG signals, and early detection and treatment of cardiovascular diseases [1], [2]. Generally, the amplitudes of a normal ECG range from 10 V to 5 mV and the frequency lies in the range of 0.05-150 Hz [3]. The ECG recordings are generally corrupted by noises, namely, baseline wander (BW), power line interference (PLI), muscle artifact (MA) and instrumentation noise. Furthermore, the motion artifacts is ubiquitous in ECG monitoring using wire- less body area networks (WBANs). From the corrupted ECG signals as shown in Fig. 1, it can be noted that the presence of BW, PLI and muscle noises causes inaccurate determination of ECG characteristic points, feature determination, heartbeat segmentation, etc. Thus, assessment of ECG signal quality has become an unavoidable rst step in most holter and ambulatory ECG signal analysis applications including cardiac arrhythmias recognition, heart rate variability (HRV) analysis, ECG-based biometric, continuous beat-to-beat blood pressure measurement, sleep apnea detection, and so on. Furthermore, signal quality assessment not only plays an important role in improving diagnostic accuracy of cardiovascular diseases diagnostic systems but also plays in selecting suitable ECG signal enhancement techniques. In addition, wearable ECG monitoring devices hold the promise of continuous recording and early detection of cardiac disease events, but wearable               $PS               $PS              $PS              $PS              $PS              $PS              $PS 7LPH V E F G H I J D Fig. 1.

Thus, wearable devices demand energy-ef cient reliable ECG noise detection and classi cation for choosing suitable noise removal technique and guaranteeing clinical acceptability of ECG recordings. A. Review of ECG Signal Quality Assessment Methods Many signal quality assessment (SQA) methods have been reported based on statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, kurtosis and heuristic rules. In [4], Orphanidou, et al. presented signal quality indices for ECG and PPG 2015 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN) 978-1-4799-5991-4/15/$31.00 2015 IEEE 164 signals using heuristic rules on the extracted features from the QRS or pulse portions and RR intervals, the ratio of maximum to minimum RR interval, and template matching. In [5], SQA method using an arti cially reconstructed target lead is presented based on the removal of LF and HF noise, energy-concavity index (ECI) analysis, and a correlation- based examination subroutine calculated between ECG leads estimated by a suitably trained neural network. In [6], L. Johannesen and L. Galeotti presented automatic ECG quality scoring methodology. The method identi es ECG signals with macroscopic errors and subsequently quanti es BW, PLI or muscular noise based on the missing leads, QRS detection, segmentation and erroneous QRS detection. In [7], D. Hayn et al. presented QRS detection based ECG quality assessment based on the empty lead criterion, spike detection criterion, lead crossing point criterion and robustness of QRS detection. In [8], signal quality indices (SQIs) and data fusion meth- ods were presented for determining clinical acceptability of ECGs. The method consists of spectral energy distribution, higher order moments and inter-channel and inter-algorithm agreement, multi-layer perceptron (MLP) arti cial neural net- work and support vector machine (SVM). In [9], automatic motion and noise artifact detection was presented using em- pirical mode decomposition (EMD) and statistical approaches. In [10], Hayn et al. presented ECG quality assessment for patient empowerment in m-Health applications. The method is based on basic signal properties (amplitude, spikes, constant signal portions), number of crossing points in between different leads, and QRS amplitude vs. noise-amplitude ratio. In [11], B. E. Moody presented rule-based methods for ECG quality control. In [12], assessment of ECG quality on an android platform was performed based on the lead-fail in all leads, global high frequency noise, leads with noise causing QRS detection problems, global low frequency noise and low and high frequency noise in the beats of sinus origin. Liu et al. presented real-time signal quality assessment for ECGs col- lected using mobile phones [13]. The method is based on the four ags: misplaced electrode, huge impulse, strong Gaussian noise, error of R-wave peaks by the template matching. Based on the values of four ags, single signal quality index (SSQI) and integrative signal quality index (ISQI) were computed for single lead ECG and twelve-lead ECGs, respectively. In [14], simple scoring system for ECG quality assessment on android platform. In [15], a new ABP signal quality index (SQI) was presented for measuring morphological normality and degradation due to noise. Most existing SQA methods were validated using datasets available in Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2011 (PICC2011) [18]. B. Limitations of Existing SQA Methods Many QRS detection based SQA methods were proposed by analyzing the detected R-R intervals from the input ECG signal. The detection of exact R-R interval (or heart rate) is severely affected in the cases of clean ECG signal with (i) wide QRS complexes, (ii) low-amplitude QRS complexes, (iii) negative QRS polarities, (iv) sudden changes in RR intervals, (v) sudden changes in QRS amplitudes, (vi) sudden changes in QRS morphologies, and (vii) sharp P- and T- waves [22],[23]. Under this scenarios, the existing heart rate ECG signal quality assessment methods demand accurate de- tection of time-instants of R-peaks present in the ECG signal. Most methods use traditional R-peak detection (or waveform delineation) algorithm, which had poor detection rates in case of ECG signals. Furthermore, most detection methods include sets of amplitude-dependent, duration-dependent and interval-dependent thresholds for to detect R-peaks, and to reject or include noise and missed R-peaks. The searchback algorithm with two rules with adaptive amplitude-dependent and time-dependent thresholds were widely adopted to reject or include identi ed R-peaks located at tm and tn: i) if tn tm < 0.2 s (refractory period) and ii) search back if tn tm > 1.5RRavg. These rules may improve detections for regular rhythms but some rules may be in con ict with others. Furthermore, searchback mechanism cannot be halted in case of irregular rhythms with varying QRS complexes. Moreover, there are often lots of thresholds de ned in heuristic rules [22]. In most approaches, the detection thresholds were adapted based on past detected R-peaks. In such a case, detection performance highly depends on the accurate estimation of initial thresholds at the learning phase. In EMD based methods, local waves of ECG signal and noises are distributed over a number of intrinsic mode func- tions (IMFs). Under this scenario, it is dif cult to determine the noisy IMFs from the signal IMFs. Although the frequency range of each wavelet subband is known, the wavelet coef- cients of BW, PLI, and MA noises and ECG signal are spread over detail and approximation subbands. Thus, noise subband characterization can be dif cult under time-varying PQRST morphologies and noise characteristics. However, we cannot x the wavelet lter, number of decomposition level and characteristic subbands. Thus, developing low-complexity automated ECG signal quality assessment method is still a challenging research problem. C. Contribution of this Paper In this paper, we present a simple straightforward ECG noise detection and classi cation method. The proposed method consists of four major stages: moving average ltering, blocking, feature extraction, and multi-stage decision classi - cation. In the proposed method, the features such as global and local dynamic amplitudes and autocorrelation maximum peak are extracted in this work. Based on these features, the multi-stage decision stage is constructed automatic detection and classi cation of ECG noises. Experimental results show that the method achieves an acceptable classi cation accuracy on different types of clean and noisy ECG signals. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The proposed ECG noise detection and classi cation method is described in Section II. In Section III, the performance of the proposed method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section IV. II. PROPOSED ECG NOISE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION METHOD In this Section, we present a simple straightforward method for automatically detection and classi cation of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major stages: sig- nal suppression and noise enhancement, feature extraction, amplitude-dependent detection and decision-tree based noise classi cation. 2015 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN) 165 A. ECG Signal Suppression and Noise Enhancement In this work, the proposed method implements a moving average lter for obtaining the low-frequency (LF) component part including the BW noises and the high-frequency (HF) component part including the PLI, muscle artifacts and record- ing instrument noise. In this work, the ltering step process the 10 s ECG signal x[n]. For extracting the baseline wander noise (or low-frequency (LF) artifacts) from the input ECG signal, the moving average lter is implemented as u[n] = 1 L + 1 L  k=0 x[n k] (1) where L denotes the moving average lter length. In this work, the lter length is chosen such that it can adequately capture the BW noise below 0.5 Hz. The high-frequency (HF) noise including the PLI, muscle artifacts and recording instrument noise from the input ECG signal is extracted using the difference equation as v1[n] = 1 L + 1 L  k=0 x[n k] (2) v[n] = x[n] v1[n], n = 0, 1, 2......, N 1. (3) The lter length for the moving average lter II is chosen such that it can adequately capture the ECG signal below 40 Hz. In order to avoid phase lags, the ltering operation is implemented using zero-phase ltering process with lter coef cients bk = 1, k = 0, 1, 2, 3, .....L 1. Then, the noise signal features are extracted from both LF component and HF component parts for detecting the presence of BW, PLI, muscle artifacts and recording instrument noises. The output waveforms as shown in Fig. 2 (b) and (d) show the LF component and HF component parts obtained for the ECG signal corrupted with BW noise. B. Feature Extraction Stage The feature extraction stage is implemented based on the following steps: non-overlapping blocking and feature compu- tation. In the blocking process, the ltered signal is divided into non-overlapping blocks with block duration of 200 ms. In this work, the kth block uk(n) of u(n) is obtained as uk[n] = u[Pk + n] n = 1, 2, P (4) where k = 0, 1 M 1, M = N P and P denotes the size of the window. For each processing window, the maximum and minimum values are computed for discriminating the background noise level which can mask the low-amplitude local waves of the PQRST morphologies. In this work, the maximum and minimum amplitude values of each window are computed as amax[k] = max{uk[n]} k = 0, 1 M 1 (5) amin[k] = min{uk[n]} k = 0, 1 M 1 For detecting the presence of BW noises, the dynamic ampli- tude range of each window is compared with the prede ned amplitude threshold. The dynamic amplitude range is com- puted as adr[k] = amax[k] amin[k] k = 0, 1, 2 M 1 (6)              7LPH V $PS              7LPH V $PS                %ORFN1XPEHU $PS              7LPH V $PS D  G F E Fig. 2.

The output waveforms of each step of the feature extraction stage are shown in Fig. 2. The LF component part in Fig. 2(b) contains the BW noise with larger amplitude variation. In order to discriminate the BW noise from the abrupt change artifacts, the local dynamic amplitude range is estimated for each window. The output of the dynamic amplitude range estimator for the LF component part is shown in Fig. 2 (c). By implementing the amplitude thresholding rule with a prede ned threshold 1, adr[k] > 1, the BW noise event is distinguished from the abrupt change artifacts by determining low-magnitude frame ratio.

The order of the lter is chosen such that the 50/60 Hz PLI and muscle noises are captured in the HF component part. For a test ECG signal corrupted with BW noise, the extracted HF component part is shown in Fig. 2(d). It is observed that the HF component not only contains low-amplitude high-frequency background noise but also includes components of QRS complexes. In this work, the in uence of the high-frequency noises is rst detected by comparing the estimated maximum value of the absolute of HF component with a prede ned amplitude threshold , which is found based on the amplitudes of local waves of the ECG signal as shown in Table I. Based upon the amplitudes of local waves, the amplitude threshold is chosen. The low-amplitude PLI and muscle noises may be removed by 2015 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN) 166              7LPH V $PS              7LPH V $PS       /DJ 5Y N       /DJ 5Y N D E F G Fig. 3.

The method assumes that the high-amplitude PLI and muscle noises can mask the ducial points (onsets, offsets, peaks) of the medium amplitude local waves (including, P, q, T, and U). In this work, the acceptable background noise level is chosen such that the ducial points can be preserved after applying noise removal techniques. The amplitude threshold of 0.02 mV is chosen. For detecting the presence of HF noise part, we estimate the total number of samples (NHF) that are above the =0.02 mV. If the estimated NHF > 2 Fs then the method labels the presence of HF noise part. Once the presence of the HF noise part is identi ed then the HF noise is further processed to classify the HF noise part into a PLI noise or a muscle noise. In the HF noise classi cation process, the HF component part is segmented into overlapping blocks with duration of 200 ms with block shift (Q) of 100 ms. The overlapping blocking process is implemented as vk[n] = v[Pk 2 + n] n = 1, 2, P (7) where k = 0, 1 M1 1 and M1 = N Q . In this work, the autocorrelation features are used for discriminating the structured PLI noise from the muscle noise. In our previous work, the effectiveness of the autocorrelation function in determining the periodicity of the signal [24]. For each block vk[n], the autocorrelation sequence is computed as Rk( ) = 1 P P  n=0 vk[n]vk[n + ] (8) where Rk( ) denotes the autocorrelation function (ACF) for vk[n] and denotes the autocorrelation lag. With reference to the rst negative zerocrossing point, the global maximum of the autocorrelation function is estimated for each block. The results of the autocorrelation function are shown in Fig. 3 for visual inspection. The autocorrelation plots show that              7LPH V $PS              7LPH V $PS               %ORFN1XPEHU $PS              7LPH V $PS          %ORFN1XPEHU 1RUP5Y N D  E F G H Fig. 4.

The effectiveness of the ACF function is further evaluated using the ECG signals corrupted with muscle artifacts and PLI noise. The output waveforms of the autocorrelation feature extraction stage are shown in Figs. 4 and 5. For these two noisy ECG signals, the LF component parts show low-amplitude BW noise component which is less than the BW noise amplitude threshold 1. The HF component parts for the ECG signals corrupted with muscle artifacts and PLI noise are shown in Figs. 4(d) and 5(d), respectively. The ACF feature signals are shown in Figs. 4(e) and 5(e). From the ACF signal as shown in Fig. 4(e), it is noted that the most signal blocks have maximum peak value below 0.2. From this experiment, we notice that most blocks from the muscle artifact part have poor intra-block correlation. Meanwhile, the ACF result in Fig. 5(e) shows that most blocks have maximum peak value above 0.4. By selecting the suitable autocorrelation peak threshold, the HF component part is classi ed into a PLI noise and a muscle noise. A simpli ed multi-stage decision based noise detection and classi cation method is shown in Fig. 6. III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION In this Section, we evaluate the performance of the pro- posed detection and classi cation method using a wide variety of ECG signals including different kinds of PQRST mor- phologies and various kinds of artifacts and noise including baseline wander (BW), abrupt change (ABC) artifacts, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts. In this work, the rst decision stage rst detects the presence of the low- frequency (LF) noise (including, baseline wander (BW) and abrupt change (ABC) artifacts) and the high-frequency (HF) noise (including, power line interference (PLI) and muscle artifacts). In the second decision stage, the LF component and HF component parts are further classi ed into any of the BW, 2015 2nd International Conference on Signal Processing and Integrated Networks (SPIN) 167 TABLE II.

For performance evaluation purposes, a large scale of test ECG signal database is created using ECG signals taken from records of the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database (mitadb) [17]. The ECG signals were sampled at rate of 360 Hz and quantized with resolution of 11-bit. The test ECG database has 150 ECG signals. The duration of each test ECG signal is 10 s. A large scale of test ECG database is created by adding various kinds of noises with different noise levels. The synthetic noises are generated using the software package available in [21].

In the future directions, we further study the performance of the proposed detection and classi cation method using the other mixture of noise types. The proposed method uses simple ltering, feature extraction and classi cation techniques as compared with signal decomposition and feature extraction techniques and supervised classi ers of the existing noise de- tection and classi cation methods. The wearable cardiac mon- itoring devices highly demand a low-complexity signal quality assessment method since these wearable medical devices have limited battery power, memory space and computational speed. Based on the classi cation results, we believe that the proposed method is suitable for assessing the quality of ECG recordings in holter and ambulatory monitoring applications. IV. CONCLUSION In this paper, we present a simple method for automatically detection and classi cation of ECG noises. The proposed method consists of four major steps: moving average lter, blocking, feature extraction, and multistage decision-tree al- gorithm. In the proposed method, the features including the global and local dynamic amplitude ranges and autocorrelation maximum peak extracted for detection and classi cation of ECG noises. The proposed detection and classi cation method is tested and validated using a wide variety of clean and noisy ECG signals. Results show that the method can achieve an average sensitivity (Se) of 97.88%, positive productivity (+P) of 91.18% and accuracy of 89.06%. Unlike other existing methods, the proposed method uses simple ltering, feature extraction and classi cation techniques. REFERENCES [1] A. Pantelopoulos, N. G.
