ORIGINAL ARTICLE Quantum-inspired evolutionary approach for selection of optimal parameters of fuzzy clustering Neha Bharill1 Om Prakash Patel1 Aruna Tiwari1 Revised: 22 June 2017  The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden 2017 Abstract Recently, Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) algorithm is most widely used because of its ef ciency and simplicity. However, FCM is sensitive to the initialization of fuzziness factor (m) and the number of clusters (c) due to which it easily trapped in local optima. A selection of these parameters is a critical issue because an adverse selection can blur the clusters in the data. In the available fuzzy clustering literature, cluster validity index is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset, but these indexes may trap into the local optima due to the random selection of m. From the perspective of handling local optima problem, we proposed a hybrid fuzzy clus- tering approach referred as quantum-inspired evolutionary fuzzy c-means algorithm. In the proposed approach, we integrate the concept of quantum computing with FCM to evolve the parameter m in several generations. The evo- lution of fuzziness factor (m) with the quantum concept aims to provide the better characteristic of population diversity and large search space to nd the global optimal value of m and its corresponding value of c. Experiments using three real-world datasets are reported and discussed. The results of the proposed approach are compared to those obtained from validity indexes like VCWB and VOS and evolutionary fuzzy based clustering algorithms. The results show that proposed method achieves the global optimal value of m, c with a minimum value of tness function and shows signi cant improvement in the convergence times (the number of iterations) as compared to the state-of-the- art methods. Keywords Quantum computing  Fuzzy clustering  Fuzzy c-Means  Cluster validity index 1 Introduction Clustering is an unsupervised learning approach which plays a signi cant role in pattern recognition (Webb 2003). It is the process of grouping the data points in the clusters (groups) so that the data points belong to the same cluster should exhibit the similarity with each other than those which are in different groups (Jain 2010; Kaufman and Rousseeuw 2009). Clustering algorithms are broadly clas- si ed into two main groups: hard clustering and fuzzy clustering methods (Xu and Wunsch 2005). Hard clustering algorithm partition the datasets into clusters, where each object is allowed to belong to a single cluster. Fuzzy clustering algorithms allow each object to belong to mul- tiple clusters with varying membership degree which rep- resents how far the object belongs to the cluster. Fuzzy c-Means is one of the most widely used fuzzy clustering methods proposed by Bezdek et al. (1984). It is widely applied to the datasets that have highly overlapping groups. Since FCM is an ef cient algorithm because it generates satisfactory results in many applications. How- ever, FCM suffers from various shortcomings such as determining the most proper number of clusters (c), and the & Neha Bharill phd12120103@iiti.ac.in Om Prakash Patel phd1301201003@iiti.ac.in Aruna Tiwari artiwari@iiti.ac.in 1 Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Indore, Simrol, Indore, Madhya Pradesh, India 123 Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag DOI 10.1007/s13198-017-0681-x fuzziness factor (m) is an important issue in fuzzy cluster analysis, which signi cantly affects the clustering results of FCM (Baskir and Turksen 2013; Stetco et al. 2015). But, due to the scarcity of computationally fast methods for determining the value of these parameters, random selec- tion of these parameters makes the iterative process falling into the local optimal solution and may lead to the inclu- sion of purely random uctuations in the results by ignoring potentially important data (Izakian and Abraham 2011). In the literature, the most commonly used approach for nding the optimal number of clusters (c) and the fuzziness factor (m) is by prede ned criteria function known as a cluster validity index (CVI). Though CVIs determine the optimal number of clusters, it also assists in selecting the optimal value of fuzziness factor in the FCM. The FCM algorithm is executed several times with differ- ent values of m, and the optimal value of m is determined when CVIs attain their extreme values. Some of these validity indexes are Bezdek (1973, 1974, 1998), Fukuyama and Sugeno (1989), Rezaee et al. (1998), Kim et al. (2004), Bharill and Tiwari (2014), Zhou et al. (2014), Erilli et al. (2011). In addition to this, there have been lots of studies carried out for the selection of the fuzziness factor in the FCM. Pal and Bezdek (1995) investigated that fuzziness factor (m) is an important factor in uencing the effectiveness of FCM and present a heuristic rule suggesting that an appropriate value of m is limited to [1.5, 2.5]. They assumed that median value m 2 could be chosen as the optimal value without any special constraints. Yu et al. (2004), present a theoretical upper bound for m that can prevent the sample mean from being a unique optimizer of the FCM objective. Furthermore, Ozkan and Turksen (2004) proposed a method that determines the upper and lower bound value of m is 1.4 and 2.6 respectively, based on the expansion of membership function around cluster center and mass cen- ter. Wu (2012) presented a new guideline for selecting the parameter m based on the robust analysis of FCM. Huang et al. (2012) studied the relationship between m and the distribution of clusters and identi ed a range of values of m based on the behavior of membership function on two particular data points. However, there is no theoretical guidance for the selection of m in the FCM. Furthermore, regarding the selection of an appropriate number of clusters and solving the problem of local con- vergence in FCM, many evolutionary hybrid data cluster- ing algorithms is proposed. Li et al. (2007) proposed a PSO-based fuzzy clustering algorithm using the advantage of global search capabilities of PSO algorithm to overcome the shortcoming of FCM. Izakian and Abraham (2011) proposed a hybrid fuzzy data clustering algorithm com- bining the merits of FCM and fuzzy PSO to overcome the local convergence problem in the FCM. Bandyopadhyay and Maulik (2001) proposed an evolutionary approach based on a variable length genetic algorithm for nding the number of clusters. Recently, the work of merging quan- tum computing and evolutionary computing has simulated the studies of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms and their applications. Han and Kim (2002) proposed a quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (QEA) to solve the combinational problem. QEA used a Q-bit as a prob- abilistic representation and a Q-bit individual consist of a string of a Q-bit. The Q-bit representation in the quantum computing represents the linear superposition of states probabilistically which provides the better characteristic of population diversity than other representations. This enables the more effective exploration of the search space, leading to the global optimum solution in the search space by effectively eliminating premature convergence. Inspired by the idea Hung et al. (2013) proposed a quantum-mod- eled Fuzzy c-Means algorithm for remotely sensed multi- band image segmentation. It uses this model for providing diversity in selecting the initial fuzzy clustering member- ship as an input to the FCM clustering and thus produces better results than a traditional FCM algorithm. Wang et al. (2014) proposed an approach for determining the multi- distribution center location by merging real-parameter quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm (RQIEA) and FCM. It overcomes the local search defect of the FCM by making the optimization results independent of the choice of initial values of the cluster centroid (Pal and Bezdek 1995; Yu et al. 2004). Xiao et al. (2010) proposed a quantum-inspired genetic algorithm for k-means clustering (KMQGA) which uses quantum bit representation as well as the typical genetic algorithm operations (selection, crossover, and mutation to determine the optimal number of clusters and to provide the optimal cluster centroids. Silva Filho et al. (2015) proposed hybrid methods for fuzzy clustering refers to as FCM IDPSO and FCM2 IDPSO which combines the FCM with the recent version of PSO. In this, the IDPSO adjust PSO parameters dynamically during execution, aiming to provide a better balance between exploration and exploitation, avoiding falling into local minima quickly and thereby obtaining better solutions. In this paper, a hybrid fuzzy clustering algorithm is proposed, which is named as Quantum-Inspired Evolu- tionary Fuzzy c-Means (QIE FCM) algorithm. The pro- posed approach uses the merits of quantum computing for nding the global optimal value of m and its corresponding value of c in the FCM. QIE FCM uses a quantum bit individual to represent the fuzziness factor (m) in each generation (g, user de ned number). Before passing the fuzziness factor (m) for the clustering of data using the FCM algorithm, the quantum bits of fuzziness factor have to be encoded into the binary representation to explore the Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 quantum search space, and after that, it has to be converted into real coded representation. For the real coded value of m obtained in generation g, several iterations of the FCM algorithm are executed by varying values of c in the range of [cmin,..., cmax] where cmin 2 and cmax = p n (n is the number of instances) (Ho ppner 1999). During each gen- eration (g) of QIE FCM, a cluster validity index is required to validate the obtained fuzzy partitions corresponding to different values of c, so this paper uses VIDSO (Bharill and Tiwari 2014) index for the cluster validity. In each gen- eration of the QIE FCM, the quantum bits of fuzziness factor is updated using the quantum rotational gate (Han and Kim 2004). After several generations of QIE FCM, the proposed algorithm guarantees to nd the global optimum value of fuzziness factor (m) and its corresponding number of clusters (c) by effectively eliminating premature con- vergence in the FCM. The proposed method improves the way of initialization of the fuzziness factor (m) in the FCM and provides the diversity in selecting the optimal value of m and c from a large quantum search space. Real life datasets (Lichman 2015) are used to measure the perfor- mance of the proposed approach in comparison with standard validity indexes. The performance is measured in terms of faster convergence times (the number of itera- tions), lower value of the tness function, the global opti- mal value of fuzziness factor (m) and the number of clusters (c). Furthermore, proposed approach shows the superior clustering results in comparison with evolutionary fuzzy based clustering algorithms (Bandyopadhyay and Maulik 2001; Hung et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Xiao et al. 2010; Silva Filho et al. 2015; Bandyopadhyay 2011) in terms of the low value of tness function and the optimal number of clusters. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 brie y introduces the concept of quantum computing. Section 3 introduces fuzzy c-means clustering. Section 4 summarizes fuzzy cluster validity indexes; Sect. 5 present the description of proposed QIE FCM algorithm. Experi- mental results and detailed analysis are presented in Sect. 6; Sect. 7 discusses the ndings and present future work. 2 Quantum computing Before describing QIE FCM, we present the introduction of quantum computing brie y. In quantum computers, the smallest unit of information representation is called quan- tum bits or (Q-bit) (Hey 1999). A Q-bit is fundamentally different from binary bits used in traditional digital com- puters for data representation. A single binary bit can represent only two-state, i.e. 0 and 1 . However, the Q-bit may be in the 0 state, 1 or in any superposition of the two states. The state of a Q-bit can be represented by the formula (1): Q a j 0i b j 1i a b  1 where a and b are the complex numbers representing the probabilities that Q-bit may appear in 0 state and 1 state. Here, a2 represent the probability of a Q-bit in 0 state, whereas b2 denote the probability of a Q-bit in 1 state, which is de ned as follows: a2 b2 1; 0  a  1; 0  b  1 2 The advantage of quantum concept is that a Q-bit indi- vidual consist of n number of Q-bits, which is de ned as follows: 3 Suppose, a Q-bit individual with three Q-bits are repre- sented as follows: Q  1= 2 p j1= 2 p j1= 2 p 1= 2 p j1= 2 p j1= 2 p  4 A Q-bit individual has the ability to represent a linear superposition of states. Thus, a Q-individual with three-Q- bits can represent the linear superposition of eight states, which is presented as follows: Q 1=2 2 p h000i 1=2 2 p h001i 1=2 2 p h010i 1=2 2 p h011i 1=2 2 p h100i 1=2 2 p h101i 1=2 2 p h110i 1=2 2 p h111i 5 A Q-bit individual with three-Q-bit system would perform the operation on eight values, thus Q-bit individual with n- Q-bit will perform operations on 2n values. As shown in Eq. (5), a single Q-bit individual is enough to represent eight states. Thus, Q-bit representation provides linear superposition of states in the search space probabilistically (Han and Kim 2002). Therefore, it has a better character- istic of population diversity than other representations that also enable us to exploit the global solution in the search space. Inspired by the concept of Q-bit representation in quantum computing, in this paper, we propose a Quantum- Inspired Evolutionary Fuzzy c-Means algorithm, which nds the best value of fuzziness factor and the number of clusters for the effective clustering of data from a large quantum search space. Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 3 Fuzzy c-Means (FCM) algorithm Fuzzy c-Means algorithm is one of the well-known fuzzy clustering method developed by Dunn (1973) and improved by Bezdek (2013). It attempts to partition the set of n data points X = [x1; x2; . . .; xn] into a collection of c fuzzy clusters F F1; F2; . . .; Fc by minimizing the following objective function: Jm U; V X c i 1 X n j 1 lij mkxi  vjk2; m [ 1 6 where, lij is the membership degree of data point xj to the fuzzy cluster Fi, m is the fuzziness factor which controls the fuzziness of the resulting clusters. V= v1; v2; . . .; vc is a vector of cluster centroids for the fuzzy clusters F1; F2; . . .; Fc. The goal of the FCM algorithm is to itera- tively improve a set of fuzzy cluster centroids until no further change in Jm U; V . The step-wise procedure of FCM algorithm is stated as follows: The performance of the Fuzzy c-Means algorithm is sensitive to the selection of c and m which is done ran- domly. Due to this, FCM will not be able to guarantee of getting close to the optimal results and likely to fall into local optima (Flores-Sintas et al. 1999). 4 Fuzzy cluster validity index In fuzzy clustering, nding the optimal number of clusters is an important problem. The cluster validity index is widely adapted to nd the optimal number of clusters when the number of clusters is not known in advance. Consequently, the cluster validity is also used to validate the quality of produced partitions such that whether the produced parti- tions accurately present the structure of the dataset or not. The literature suggests that the most important factors in the validity indexes are intra-cluster compactness, inter-cluster separation, and inter-cluster overlap. The intra-cluster compactness refers to the density of data points present in the cluster. The higher compactness indicates the good partition. In contrast, the inter-cluster separation indicates that how far apart the clusters are located from each other. The higher value of this term indicates the larger separation between the clusters and better fuzzy partitions. The other important factor inter-cluster overlap indicates the degree of overlap between the fuzzy clusters. In the literature, a wide variety of cluster validity indexes exist for fuzzy clustering. In this section, we review some of the cluster validity indexes available in the literature. 4.1 Partition coef cient (PC) and partition entropy (PE) Bezdek proposed two cluster validity indexes for fuzzy clustering, the partition coef cient (PC) (Bezdek 1974) and the partition entropy (PE) (Bezdek 1973), which is de ned as: VPC 1 n X c i 1 X n j 1 l2 ij 10 VPE  1 n X c i 1 X n j 1 lij loga lij 11 Both the indexes achieve the optimal number of clusters (c) by maximizing the VPC and minimizing the VPE with respect to c cmin; . . .; cmax. 4.2 VCWB validity index Rezaee et al. (1998) proposed a validity index which is de ned as follows: VCWB a Pc i 1 Pn j 1 lij xj  vi 2 cnjjr X jj Dmax Dmin X c k 1  X c z 1 jjvk  vzjj 1 12 Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 In this equation, r X denote the variance of pattern set X, and Dmin and Dmax are the minimum and maximum dis- tances between the cluster centroids, respectively. The minimum value of VCWB leads to an optimal value of c. 4.3 VOS validity index Kim et al. (2004) proposed a validity index which is de ned as follows: vos 2 c c1 X c1 p 1 X c q p 1   X l X n j 1 d xj; l : ~ Fp; ~ Fq x xj  1  min |{z} p6 q  max |{z} x2X min l ~ Fp x ; l ~ Fq x  13 A minimum value of this index indicates an optimal value of c with the partition in which clusters overlap to a lesser degree and are more separated from each other. 4.4 VIDSO validity index Bharill and Tiwari (2014) proposed a validity index that validates the tness of produced fuzzy partitions by three measures, i.e. intra-cluster compactness, inter-cluster sep- aration, and inter-cluster overlap. The VIDSO validity index is de ned as follows: VIDSO c; U DispN c; U OverlapN c; U SepN c; U 14 DispN c; U Disp c; U Dispmax 15 SepN c; U Sep c; U Sepmax 16 OverlapN c; U Overlap c; U Overlapmax 17 where, Disp(c, U) denotes the dispersion of all the data points for c number of clusters, Sep(c, U) represents the separation among all pairs of c fuzzy clusters and Over- lap(c, U) denote the total overlap among all pairs of c fuzzy clusters. Dispmax, Sepmax, and Overlapmax repre- sent the maximum value of dispersion, separation, and overlap. DispN c; U , SepN c; U , and OverlapN c; U show the normalized value of dispersion, separation, and overlap for c number of clusters. The minimum value of VIDSO c; U leads to an optimal value of c which indicates the partition in which clusters are more compact, over- lapped with a lesser degree, and are more separated from each other. 5 Proposed Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Fuzzy c-Means algorithm (QIE FCM) Pal and Bezdek (1995), suggested that fuzziness factor (m) and the number of clusters (c), signi cantly in uence the clustering performance of FCM. To nd an appropriate value of m and c for the ef cient execution of FCM, in this paper, we propose a Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Fuzzy c-Means (QIE FCM) algorithm. In QIE FCM, the fuzzi- ness factor (m) is represented in terms of quantum bits (Q- bit). In QIE FCM, quantum gates are used, which update the quantum bits to generate the different value of m in each generation from a large search space. For each value of m, the optimal number of clusters (c) is determined which corresponds to the minimum value of the tness function (Bharill and Tiwari 2014). The working of the proposed QIE FCM algorithm is categorized into ve major steps: initialization of fuzziness factor (m), transformation pro- cess, selection of the objective function, evaluation of a tness function, and evolution of fuzziness factor. 5.1 Initialization of fuzziness factor Inspired by the idea mentioned above of Han and Kim (2002), in the proposed algorithm, the quantum concept is utilized to nd out the global optimal value of m from a large search space. To achieve this, the fuzziness factor (m) is represented in terms of quantum bits and a different value of m is evolved in each generation of the QIE FCM. Let us represent the fuzziness factor (m) in terms of quantum bits for a generation (g) as M 0 g, which is de ned as follows: M 0 g Qg 18 where, a Q-bit individual Qg is assumed to contain k quantum bits, which are represented as Qg ag 1 j ag 2 j    j ag k. The best value of fuzziness factor (m) is obtained from a large search space which is divided into 2k subspaces. However, the proposed algorithm run on a classical computer; therefore, there is a need to convert the fuzziness factor from quantum bits M 0 g to the real coded value mg. This conversion can be done with the help of the transformation process (Lu et al. 2013). 5.2 Transformation process The transformation process is used to obtain the real coded parameter mg from the quantum value of fuzziness factor M0 g . It starts by taking random R where R= r1; r2; . . .; rk, corresponding to Qg ag 1 j ag 2 j    j ag k. The value of ri is Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 selected with the help of random function which generates uniform number between 0 and 1. Then, the further map- ping is done by using the binary matrix Sg where Sg = sg 1. . .sg i . . .sg k. The value of matrix Sg is generated as follows: if ri  ag i 2 then sg i 1 else sg i 0: 19 Now, with the help of binary matrix Sg and the Gaussian random generator (grg) having parameters mean value lg i and variance rg i 2, is represented as grg lg i ; rg i , the real coded value of fuzziness factor (mg) has been generated. The observation process shows the process of conversion of a single Q-bit. The step-wise procedure of the trans- formation process is discussed as follows: The transformation process can be understood with the help of an example. Let a quantum bit of length two-Q-bits are represented as Q =h0:345j:877i and a random number matrix is generated using a random number R=[0.65 0.08]. Now using Eq. (19), the binary matrix is generated as S=[01]. Once the binary matrix is achieved, then the for- mula is used which convert a binary number to a decimal value (bin2dec(S)?1). This return a number between 1 to 4 and corresponding four Gaussian random values, for example grg(0.25, 0.03), grg(0.40, 0.03), grg(0.55, 0.03), grg(0.70, 0.03). As a binary value achieved here is S=[01] which return 2 as decimal value, therefore the real coded value from grg(0.40, 0.03) corresponding to quantum bit Q is selected. 5.3 Evaluation of local and global tness function Once the real coded value of fuzziness factor (mg) is obtained through the transformation process, then for the different values of c = [cmin,..., cmax], the FCM algorithm is executed. For each value of c, after several iterations of the FCM algorithm, the stable cluster centroids and the cor- responding fuzzy partitions are obtained. The selection of best fuzzy partition from a set of obtained fuzzy partitions is a critical issue. In this paper, the VIDSO index proposed by Bharill and Tiwari (2014) is used as the objective function to evaluate the tness of obtained fuzzy partitions. The value of VIDSO objective function on different values of c has different scales that need to be reconciled through a normalization process. Thus we normalized the VIDSO objective function for each value of c, which is de ned as follows: VIsum DSO c; U X cmax c cmin VIDSO c; U 20 VINormalized DSO c; U VIDSO c; U VIsum DSO c; U 21 To ensure the selection of best fuzzy partition in generation (g), the evaluation of local tness function is done by nding the minimum value from the set of normalized values of VIDSO c; U objective function, which is denoted by Fg Lbest mg; c and represented as follows: Fg Lbest mg; c min cmin  c  cmax VINormalized DSO c; U  22 where Fg Lbest mg; c is the minimum value of the tness function which is determined corresponding to mg by varying the value of clusters c cmin; . . .; cmax. Further- more, to ensure the selection of the best value of fuzziness factor (m) from the large search space provided by the quantum concept, one more parameter is taken into account, which stores the global best value of the tness function among all the generations denoted by FGbest mbest; cbest . Let us assume, the initial value of FGbest mbest; cbest as 1. The formulation of global best tness function FGbest mbest; cbest is de ned as follows: Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 FGbest mbest; cbest min FGbest mbest; cbest ; Fg Lbest mg; c 23 where mbest and cbest denote the best value of fuzziness factor (m) and the number of clusters (c) generated through an evolutionary process from a large quantum search space. As discussed above, to nd the best value of m, the QIE FCM algorithm is executed for several generations. To do so, there is a need for evolving the fuzziness factor (m) in each gen- eration. Thus, the new value of m in each generation (g) is obtained by updating quantum bits of fuzziness factor (M 0 g). To update the quantum bits of fuzziness factor from M 0 g to M 0 g 1, quantum rotation gates (Han and Kim 2004) are used which is described in the subsequent section. 5.4 Evolution of fuzziness factor To evolve the different value of fuzziness factor in each generation, the quantum bits of fuzziness factor are updated using the quantum rotation gates (Han and Kim 2004). The quantum gates require proper angle to rotate the quantum bit, which is de ned as follows: U Dh cos Dh  sin Dh sin Dh cos Dh 24 where Dh is a rotation angle which is used to generate M 0 g 1 from M 0 g. In the proposed algorithm, the length of a Q-bit individual Qg ag 1 j ag 2 j  j ag k is considered as 2 (k=2). It means that mg will be selected from 4 subspaces. ag 1 i bg 1 i cos Dh  sin Dh sin Dh cos Dh  ag i bg i 25 where rotation angle (Dh) is calculated on the basis of global and local tness function FGbest mbest; cbest and Fg Lbest mg; c . The transformation process shows that each Q-bit ag i is associated with the binary value sg i , therefore a mapping is done between FGbest mbest; cbest , Fg Lbest mg; c and sg i to update an individual Q-bit. The values of FGbest mbest; cbest and Fg Lbest mg; c is obtained corre- sponding to sglobal i and sg i where, sglobal i and sg i are the binary values corresponding to FGbest mbest; cbest and Fg Lbest mg; c , respectively. Table 1, summarizes the above- discussed parameters. If the value of Fg Lbest mg; c obtained in the current generation is worse than the value of FGbest mbest; cbest obtained in the previous generation, and state of sg i is zero in the current generation and sglobal i is one, then decrementing the probability of ag i to zero may pro- duce the worst result. Therefore, to update ag i , it is required that Dh must be negative. On the contrary, if the value of Fg Lbest mg; c obtained in the current generation is better than the value of FGbest mbest; cbest obtained in the previous generation, and state of sg i is one in the current iteration and sglobal i is zero, then increasing the probability of ag i to one may produce the worst result. Therefore, to update ag i , Dh must be positive. In other cases, Dh will remain zero. The value of Dh must be selected in such a way so that it can take a minimum number of iterations to cover a maximum number of values of ag i in the range of (0, 1). Therefore, Dh must be initialized between [0:01  p, 0:05  p] (Han and Kim 2004). For preventing the quantum bit ag i from acquiring values 0 or 1, following constraint, is applied: ag i e p ; if ag i \ e p ag i if e p  ag i  1  e p 1  e p if ag i [ 1  e p 8 > < > : 26 where, the value of  is assigned a very small (approxi- mately approaching to zero) so that it can cover maximum values in the range of (0, 1). The QIE FCM algorithm is executed for the gmax number of generations, which is set as the stopping criteria. The reason behind executing the QIE FCM algorithm for gmax generations is that the best value of m lies within this interval can be easily found within the maximum number of generations. If the algorithm is exe- cuted for more than gmax generations, then it will generate the similar values of m which leads to increase the com- putational overhead. The step-wise procedure of the pro- posed QIE FCM algorithm is described in Algorithm 1 as follows: Table 1 Parameters for Qubits updation sg i sglobal i FGbest mbest; cbest [ Fg Lbest mg; c Dh 0 0 False 0 0 0 True 0 0 1 False - 0.03*P 0 1 True 0 1 0 False 0 1 0 True 0.03*P 1 1 False 0 1 1 True 0 Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 6 Experimental evaluation of QIE FCM The proposed QIE FCM algorithm is implemented in MATLAB computing environment and executed on MATLAB version R2014a on Intel(R) Xeon(R) E5-1607 Workstation PC with 64 GB of memory and running on the Windows 7 Professional operating system with a process- ing speed of 3.0 GHz. In this study, three datasets from the famous UCI machine learning repository (Lichman 2015) are utilized to compare the performance and effectiveness of the QIE FCM with those of two well-known fuzzy based clustering indexes (Rezaee et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2004) and other evolutionary fuzzy based clustering algo- rithms (Bandyopadhyay and Maulik 2001; Hung et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Xiao et al. 2010; Silva Filho et al. 2015; Bandyopadhyay 2011). Experimentation is carried out on these datasets with the parameters as described in Table 2. 6.1 Datasets description This section provides a description of Pima Indian Dia- betes, Liver Disorder, and SPECTF Heart datasets used in the experiments are summarized as follows: Pima Indian Diabetes (PID) dataset: It consists of 768 data samples that belong to only female patients suffering from diabetes. It has 8 numerical features per sample.

Fig. 1a c show scatters plot of the dataset with the optimal number of clusters (c) as per the distribution of data. 6.2 Results discussion In this section, we present the experimental results to test the behavior of proposed QIE FCM algorithm in com- parison with well-known fuzzy based clustering indexes (Rezaee et al. 1998; Kim et al. 2004). Table 3, present the optimal value of tness function and the corresponding best value of tness factor for all three datasets. For Pima Indian Diabetes dataset, QIE FCM achieves the optimal tness value 0.000031 at m 1:5 which is much smaller than the optimal tness value obtained by VCWB and VOS at m 1:5 and m 2:5, respectively. Similarly, for Liver Disorder dataset, the minimum tness value achieved by QIE FCM is 0.000037 at m 2:3 which is remarkably lesser than the minimum tness value, attain by VCWB and VOS at m 1:5 and m 2:4, respectively. In case of SPECTF heart dataset, the optimal tness value achieved by QIE FCM is 0.0000021 at m 2:4 which is signi cantly much lesser than the minimum value of the tness function obtained by VCWB and VOS at m 2:3 and m 1:5, respectively. The above- reported results justify the superiority of proposed QIE FCM algorithm over classical validity indexes in terms of nding the global best value of fuzziness factor (m) and the corresponding value of the tness function for all the datasets. The superiority of QIE FCM over other indexes is mainly because the quantum concept is applied in fuzzy clustering for evolving fuzziness factor (m) in several generations. Through this, we get a larger search space, and thus we can assure the selection of the global optimal value of m and the tness function by eliminating the problem of local convergence occurs in fuzzy clustering. In Fig. 2 for the speci c value of fuzziness factor (m = 2), we have reported the optimal number of clusters iden- ti ed by our approach in comparison with two other indexes (Kim et al. 2004; Rezaee et al. 1998). According to the distribution of data shown in Fig. 1, the optimal number of clusters (c) for Pima Indian Diabetes, Liver Disorders, and SPECTF heart disease dataset is 3, 2, and 5, respectively. We can see from the results that, QIE FCM achieves the minimum value of the tness function for Pima Indian Diabetes, Bupa Liver Disorders, and SPECTF Heart Disease at c 3, 2, and 5, respectively. As per the distribution of data shown in Fig. 1, the proposed approach correctly identi es the optimal number of clusters (c) for all the three datasets in comparison with VCWB and VOS. Hence, the reported results con rm the superiority of the proposed algorithm over classical indexes VCWB and VOS for all three datasets in terms of determining the optimal number of clusters (c). In Tables 4, 5 and 6, we have reported the number of iterations acquired by the QIE FCM algorithm in deter- mining the optimal number of clusters (c) corresponding to Fig. 1 The scatter plots of Pima Indian Diabetes, BUPA Liver Disorder and SPECTF Heart Disease datasets with optimal number of clusters (C) Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 the weighted exponent (m). The performance of the QIE FCM algorithm is also compared with the VCWB and VOS indexes. It can be seen from results that for all the three datasets, the QIE FCM algorithm always takes the least number of iterations with minimum standard deviation in comparison with VCWB and VOS indexes. This shows that QIE FCM is computationally better than VCWB and VOS indexes. 6.3 Comparison with other methods The proposed method is also compared with many fuzzy based evolutionary clustering algorithms (Bandyopadhyay and Maulik 2001; Hung et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Xiao et al. 2010; Silva Filho et al. 2015; Bandyopadhyay 2011) in terms of the number of the clusters and value of the tness function. It is observed from the results reported in Table 7 that the proposed approach was able to identify the exact number of clusters correctly for all the datasets. In contrast, the comparable approaches fail to nd the exact number of clusters for these datasets. In addition to this, the optimal value of the tness function achieved by the pro- posed approach is comparatively much lesser than the minimum value of the tness function achieved by other compared approaches. It is important to highlight that proposed approach also identi es the appropriate value of Table 3 Comparison of optimal value of tness function for three datasets Datasets QIE FCM VCWB (Rezaee et al. 1998) VOS (Kim et al. 2004) m Fitness m Fitness m Fitness function function function Pima Indian diabetes 1.5 0.000031 1.5 0.04130 2.5 0.06036 BUPA liver disorder 2.3 0.000037 1.5 0.05258 2.4 0.04233 SPECTF heart disease 2.4 0.0000021 2.3 0.00352 1.5 0.04475 Fig. 2 Comparison of number of clusters (c) evaluated by QIE FCM algorithm, VCWB and VOS indexes at m 2 for all the three datasets Table 4 Comparison of number of iterations for Pima Indian diabetes data Datasets Fuzziness factor QIE FCM VCWB (Rezaee et al. 1998) VOS (Kim et al. 2004) Mean Std dev Mean Std dev Mean Std dev Pima Indian diabetes 1.51 160.03 0.8105 160.8 0.8234 161.57 0.8379 1.99 155.73 0.9810 156.5 1.0043 157.26 1.0284 2.25 164.00 1.0647 164.76 1.0854 194.34 1.5205 2.30 156.23 0.9574 163.50 1.0295 164.26 1.0539 2.32 168.61 1.0597 169.38 1.0844 170.15 1.1099 2.37 197.11 1.2522 197.88 1.2715 198.65 1.2917 2.40 166.15 1.0054 166.15 1.0054 195.34 1.5426 2.45 162.38 0.9361 202.38 1.5659 209.00 1.7121 2.48 148.42 0.8260 150.00 0.8700 164.76 0.8917 2.50 159.42 0.8556 167.15 0.8979 168.30 0.9248 Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 the fuzziness factor (m) corresponding to the optimal value of the tness function for all the datasets. On the contrary, the authors of the compared approaches do not address the issue of identifying the appropriate value of fuzziness factor (m) for these datasets. Hence, the above-reported results in Table 7 quantify the effectiveness of the pro- posed approach over other fuzzy based evolutionary approaches. 6.4 Clinical signi cance of experimental results Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) Systems are getting popular and increasingly being used by clinical experts for detection and interpretation of diseases. The CAD systems help in avoiding the possible errors made by the experts in the course of diagnosis and also the medical data can be examined in a shorter time (Petrick et al. 2013). Furthermore, it is also used by clinicians as a decision support in developing their diagnoses. Machine learning techniques are widely used to construct the CAD systems which help in decision making in the face of uncertainty. Fuzzy set theory based approaches play a vital role in dealing with the uncertainty in the medical data (Begum and Devi 2011). From the experimental results reported above, it can be observed that the proposed quantum-inspired evolutionary fuzzy c-means clustering approach ef ciently handles the uncertainty and achieve better clustering results on medical data in comparison with other evolutionary fuzzy based clustering approaches. Thus, the clustering results achieved using the proposed approach in terms of the optimal number of clusters and the fuzziness factor helps in the formation of proper clusters which acts as an ef cient decision support system to deal with medical data.

In this algorithm, the concept of quantum computing with Q-bit representation is employed to represent the fuzziness factor (m). The fuzziness factor (m) is evolved in each generation using ve major steps (initialization of fuzziness factor, transformation process, selection of the objective function, evaluation of a tness function, and Evolution of fuzziness factor). After several generations of evolution, we get a large search space that leads to the global optima and enables us to nd the best value of m and c which results in the optimal fuzzy partition. The datasets used for experimentation are taken from the UCI Reposi- tory which is used to compare the performance of QIE FCM with classical validity indexes VCWB and VOS. The QIE FCM algorithm achieves the better value of the tness function for Pima Indian Diabetes, BUPA liver disorders, and SPECTF Heart disease datasets are 0.000031, 0.000037, and 0.0000021, respectively. For these three datasets, the QIE FCM nds the best value of the fuzziness factor which is 1.5, 2.3, and 2.4, respectively, and their exact number of clusters (c) are 3, 2, and 5 respectively. These results are much better than VCWB and VOS index. In this paper, the reliability of QIE FCM algorithm over other fuzzy based clustering indexes is also veri ed which show that the identi ed number of clusters (c) do not change with the change in values of m. In addition to this, the performance of the QIE FCM algorithm is also com- pared to evolutionary fuzzy based clustering algorithms, and it is found that the proposed algorithm outperforms over these evolutionary approaches in terms of the number of clusters and the tness function. From the above results, we conclude that our proposed QIE FCM approach shows the competent or better results when compared with state- of-the-art methods. In the aspect, concerning the limitation of this research, it is important to notice that the proposed approach is applied to the datasets is very small in size. In the practical scenario, a large volume of data with high dimensionality is generated nowadays. There are other areas like feature extraction, and feature selection will help in extracting the important features from the datasets and eliminate the redundant features making the QIE FCM more ef cient in clustering. However, it is part of our future work as dis- cussed below. The proposed work also opens future research directions in multiple topics, which include (but not limited to): (a) design of the scalable quantum-fuzzy clustering algo- rithm implemented on the Hadoop infrastructure for effective clustering of large data (b) To explore a large search space, the quantum concept can also be utilized for evolving the initial cluster centroid in the fuzzy clustering Table 7 Comparison with other methods from literature Methods Datasets Pima Indian diabetes Bupa liver disorder SPECTF heart disease Number of clusters (c) Fitness function value Number of clusters (c) Fitness function value Number of clusters (c) Fitness function value QIE FCM 3 0.000031 2 0.000037 5 0.0000021 FCMVGA (Bandyopadhyay and Maulik 2001) 5 0.011029 3 0.040345 7 0.060573 QM FCM (Hung et al. 2013) 16 0.00458 5 0.03072 9 0.00993 RQECA (Wang et al. 2014) 22 0.001174 15 0.003932 11 0.000119 KMQGA (Xiao et al. 2010) 2 15.78227 2 18.3299 2 10.496 KMVGA (Xiao et al. 2010) 2 11.97661 2 16.90276 2 7.162 FCM PSO (Silva Filho et al. 2015) 2 78.3385 2 138.9046 2 199.6642 FCM IDPSO (Silva Filho et al. 2015) 2 78.306 2 138.6978 2 199.6818 FCM IDPSO2 (Silva Filho et al. 2015) 2 78.3057 2 138.0453 2 199.6642 HPSOFCM (Silva Filho et al. 2015) 2 88.8669 2 187.9076 2 215.4946 CPSFC (Silva Filho et al. 2015) 2 6.3192 2 58.2317 2 29.4008 GA clustering (Bandyopadhyay 2011) 2 2367.98 2 856.0932 2 15679.08 Int J Syst Assur Eng Manag 123 (c) design of a hybrid quantum-genetic fuzzy clustering approach for exploring a large search space by evolving the initial cluster centroid using genetic and fuzziness factor using the quantum concept. Moreover, in future, the research can be carried out for the screening of features that can reduce the computational burden of the algorithm and result in ef cient clustering of data. The proposed model is applied only to numeric data; it would be interesting to see its behavior when it is applied to different types of data available such as images, signals, text, and speech, etc. References Bandyopadhyay S (2011) Genetic algorithms for clustering and fuzzy clustering.
