These equations have a very important role to play in ef cient inferencing in approximate reasoning, especially fuzzy control systems. Of all the four equations considered, the equation I(x, S1(y, z)) = S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)), when S1, S2 are both t-conorms and I is an R-implication obtained from a strict t-norm, was not solved. In this paper, we characterize func- tions I that satisfy the previous functional equation when S1, S2 are either both strict or nilpotent t-conorms. Using the obtained characterizations, we show that the previous equation does not hold when S1, S2 are either both strict or nilpotent t-conorms, and I is a continuous fuzzy implication. Moreover, the previous equation does not hold when I is an R-implication obtained from a strict t-norm, and S1, S2 are both strict t-conorms, while it holds for an R-implication I obtained from a strict t-norm T if and only if the t-conorms S1 = S2 are -conjugate to the ukasiewicz t-conorm for some increasing bijection of the unit interval, which is also a multiplicative generator of T .

INTRODUCTION D ISTRIBUTIVITY of fuzzy implication operations over different fuzzy logic connectives has been studied in the recent past by many authors. This interest, perhaps, was kick started by Combs and Andrews in [13], wherein they exploit the following classical tautology: (p q) r (p r) (q r) in their inference mechanism toward reduction in the complex- ity of fuzzy If Then rules. They refer to the left-hand side of this equivalence as an intersection rule con guration (IRC) and to its right-hand side as a union rule con guration (URC). Sub- sequently, there were many discussions [14] [16], [24], most of them pointing out the need for a theoretical investigation re- quired for employing such equations, as concluded by Dick and Kandel [16], Future work on this issue will require an examina- tion of the properties of various combinations of fuzzy unions, intersections and implications or by Mendel and Liang [24], We think that what this all means is that we have to look past the mathematics of IRC URC and inquire whether what we are doing when we replace IRC by URC makes sense.

Digital Object Identi er 10.1109/TFUZZ.2008.924201 Trillas and Alsina [32] who were the rst to investigate the generalized version of the previous law, viz., I(T(x, y), z) = S(I(x, z), I(y, z)), x, y, z [0, 1] (1) where T, S are a t-norm and a t-conorm, respectively, general- izing the , operators, respectively, and I is a fuzzy implica- tion. From their investigations of (1) for the three main families of fuzzy implications, viz., S-implications, R-implications, and QL-implications, it was shown that in the case of R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms and S-implications, (1) holds if and only if T = min and S = max. Also along the previous lines, Balasubramaniam and Rao [10] considered the following dual equations of (1): I(S(x, y), z) = T(I(x, z), I(y, z)) (2) I(x, T1(y, z)) = T2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) (3) I(x, S1(y, z)) = S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) (4) where again, T, T1, T2 and S, S1, S2 are t-norms and t-conorms, respectively, and I is a fuzzy implication. Similarly, it was shown that when I is either an R-implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm or an S-implication, in almost all the cases, the distributivity holds only when T = T1 = T2 = min and S = S1 = S2 = max, while (4) for the case when I is an R-implication obtained from a strict t-norm was left unsolved (cf. [10, Th. 4]). This forms the main motivation of this paper. Meanwhile, Baczy nski in [2] and [3] considered the func- tional equation (3), both independently and along with other equations, and characterized fuzzy implications I in the case when T1 = T2 is a strict t-norm. Some partial studies regarding distributivity of fuzzy implications over maximum and mini- mum were presented by Bustince et al. in [12]. It may be worth recalling that (3) with T1 = T2 is one of the characterizing prop- erties of A-implications proposed by T urksen et al. in [33]. As we mentioned earlier, the previous equations (1) (4) have an important role to play in inference invariant rule reduction in fuzzy inference systems (see also [8], [9], and [30]). The very fact that about half-a-dozen works have appeared in this very journal dealing with these distributive equations is a pointer to the importance of these equations. That more recent works dealing with distributivity of fuzzy implications over uninorms (see [27] and [28]) have appeared is an indication of the sus- tained interest in the previous equations. This paper differs from the previous works that have ap- peared in this journal on these equations, in that, we attempt to solve the problem in a more general setting, by characterizing functions I that satisfy the functional equation (4) when S1, S2 are either both strict or nilpotent t-conorms.

BACZY NSKI AND JAYARAM: DISTRIBUTIVITY OF FUZZY IMPLICATIONS OVER NILPOTENT OR STRICT TRIANGULAR CONORMS 591 characterizations, we also investigate the conditions under which (4) holds when I is an R-implication obtained from a strict t-norm. The paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we give some results concerning basic fuzzy logic connectives and functional equations that will be employed extensively in the sequel. In Section III, we study (4), when I is a binary operation on [0, 1], while S1, S2 are both strict t-conorms. Based on the obtained characterization, we show that there exists no continuous so- lution I for (4) that is a fuzzy implication. Subsequently, we obtain the characterization of noncontinuous fuzzy implications I that are solutions for (4). In Section IV, we mimic the ap- proach taken in Section III, except that in this case, S1, S2 are both nilpotent t-conorms. Again in this case, the results parallel those of Section III. In Section V, we study (4) in the case when I is an R-implication obtained from a strict t-norm T. We show that (4) does not hold when S1, S2 are strict t-conorms, while using one of the characterization obtained in the previous sec- tion, we show that it holds if and only if the t-conorms S1 = S2 are -conjugate to the ukasiewicz t-conorm for some increas- ing bijection , which is a multiplicative generator of the strict t-norm T. II. PRELIMINARIES A. Basic Fuzzy Logic Connectives First, we recall some basic notations and results that will be useful in the sequel. We start with the notation of conju- gacy (see [21, p. 156]). By , we denote the family of all increasing bijections : [0, 1] [0, 1]. We say that functions f, g: [0, 1]n [0, 1] are -conjugate, if there exists a such that g = f , where f (x1, . . . , xn) := 1 (f( (x1), . . . , (xn))) for all x1, . . . , xn [0, 1]. If F is an associative binary operation on [a, b] with neutral element e, then the power notation x[n] F , where n N0, is de ned by x[n] F := e, if n = 0 x, if n = 1 F  x, x[n 1] F  , if n > 1. De nition 1 (see [20], [29]): 1) An associative, commutative, and increasing operation T: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a t-norm if it has the neutral element 1. 2) An associative, commutative, and increasing operation S: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a t-conorm if it has the neutral element 0. De nition 2 [20, De nitions 2.9 and 2.13]: A t-norm T (t-conorm S, respectively) is said to be 1) Archimedean, if for every x, y (0, 1), there is an n N such that x[n] T < y (x[n] S > y, respectively); 2) strict, if T (S, respectively) is continuous and strictly monotone, i.e., T(x, y) < T(x, z) (S(x, y) < S(x, z), re- spectively) whenever x > 0 (x < 1, respectively) and y < z; 3) nilpotent, if T (S, respectively) is continuous and if for each x (0, 1), there exists n N such that x[n] T = 0 (x[n] S = 1, respectively). Remark 1: 1) For a continuous t-conorm S, the Archimedean property is given by the simpler condition (cf. [19, Prop. 5.1.2]) S(x, x) > x, x (0, 1). 2) If a t-conorm S is continuous and Archimedean, then S is nilpotent if and only if there exists some nilpotent element of S, which is equivalent to the existence of some x, y (0, 1) such that S(x, y) = 1 (see [20, Th. 2.18]). 3) If a t-conorm S is strict or nilpotent, then it is Archimedean. Conversely, every continuous and Archimedean t-conorm is either strict or nilpotent (cf. [20, Th. 2.18]). We shall use the following characterizations of continuous Archimedean t-conorms. Theorem 1 ([23], cf. [20, Corollary 5.5]): For a function S: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) S is a continuous Archimedean t-conorm. 2) S has a continuous additive generator, i.e., there exists a continuous, strictly increasing function s: [0, 1] [0, ] with s(0) = 0, which is uniquely determined up to a pos- itive multiplicative constant, such that S(x, y) = s( 1)(s(x) + s(y)), x, y [0, 1] (5) where s( 1) is the pseudoinverse of s given by s( 1)(x) =  s 1(x), if x [0, s(1)] 1, if x (s(1), ]. Remark 2: 1) A representation of a t-conorm S as earlier can be writ- ten without explicitly using of the pseudo-inverse in the following way: S(x, y) = s 1(min(s(x) + s(y), s(1))) (6) for x, y [0, 1]. 2) S is a strict t-conorm if and only if each continuous addi- tive generator s of S satis es s(1) = . 3) S is a nilpotent t-conorm if and only if each continuous additive generator s of S satis es s(1) < . Next, two characterizations of strict t-norms and nilpotent t- conorms are well known in literature and can be easily obtained from the general characterizations of continuous Archimedean t-norms and t-conorms (see [20, Sec. 5.2]). Theorem 2: For a function T: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) T is a strict t-norm. 2) T is -conjugate with the product t-norm, i.e., there exists , which is uniquely determined up to a positive constant exponent, such that T(x, y) = 1( (x) (y)), x, y [0, 1]. (7) Theorem 3: For a function S: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. Authorized licensed use limited to: INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS.

(8) In the literature, we can nd several diverse de nitions of fuzzy implications [12], [18]. In this paper, we will use the following one, which is equivalent to the de nition introduced by Fodor and Roubens (see [18, Def. 1.15]). De nition 3: A function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a fuzzy implication if it satis es the following conditions: I is decreasing in the rst variable. (I1) I is increasing in the second variable. (I2) I(0, 0) = 1, I(1, 1) = 1, I(1, 0) = 0. (I3) From the previous de nition, we can deduce that, for each fuzzy implication, I(0, x) = I(x, 1) = 1 for x [0, 1]. Moreover, I also satis es the normality condition I(0, 1) = 1 (NC) and consequently, every fuzzy implication restricted to the set {0, 1}2 coincides with the classical implication. There are many important methods for generating fuzzy im- plications (see [17] [19]). In this paper, we need only one family R-implications. De nition 4: A function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called an R- implication if there exist a t-norm T such that I(x, y) = sup{t [0, 1] | T(x, t) y}, x, y [0, 1]. (9) If I is generated from a t-norm T by (9), then we will sometimes write IT . It is very important to note that the name R-implication is a short version of residual implication, and IT is also called as the residuum of T. This class of implications is related to a residuation concept from the intuitionistic logic. In fact, it has been shown that in this context, this de nition is proper only for left-continuous t-norms. Proposition 1 (cf. [19, Proposition 5.4.2 and Corollary 5.4.1]): For a t-norm T, the following statements are equiva- lent. 1) T is left-continuous. 2) T and IT form an adjoint pair, i.e., they satisfy T(x, t) y IT (x, y) t, x, y, t [0, 1]. 3) The supremum in (9) is the maximum, i.e., IT (x, y) = max{t [0, 1] | T(x, t) y} where the right side exists for all x, y [0, 1]. The following characterization of R-implications gener- ated from left-continuous t-norms is also well known in the literature. Theorem 4 ([25], cf. [18, Th. 1.14]): For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) I is an R-implication generated from a left-continuous t-norm. 2) I is right-continuous with respect to the second variable, and it satis es (I2), the exchange principle I(x, I(y, z)) = I(y, I(x, z)), x, y, z [0, 1] (EP) and the ordering property x y I(x, y) = 1, x, y [0, 1]. (OP) It should be noted that each R-implication I satis es the left neutrality property I(1, y) = y, y [0, 1]. (NP) Further, if T is a strict t-norm, then we have the following representation from [26, Th. 6.1.2] (see also [4, Th. 19]). Theorem 5: If I is an R-implication generated from a strict t-norm T, then I is -conjugate to the Goguen implication, i.e., there exists , which is uniquely determined up to a positive constant exponent, such that I(x, y) = 1, if x y 1  (y) (x)  , otherwise (10) for all x, y [0, 1]. We would like to underline that the increasing bijection earlier can be seen as a multiplicative generator of T in (7). The proof that is uniquely determined up to a positive constant exponent has been presented by Baczy nski and Drewniak (see [6, Th. 6]). B. Some Results Pertaining to Functional Equations Here, we present some results related to the additive and multiplicative Cauchy functional equations: f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) (11) f(xy) = f(x)f(y) (12) which are crucial in the proofs of the main theorems. Theorem 6 ([1], cf. [22, Th. 5.2.1]): For a continuous function f: R R, the following statements are equivalent. 1) f satis es the additive Cauchy functional equation (11) for all x, y R. 2) There exists a unique constant c R such that f(x) = cx (13) for all x R. Theorem 7 ([22, Th. 13.5.3]): Let A R be an interval such that 0 clA, where clA denotes the closure of the set A and let B = A + A = {a1 + a2 | a1 A, a2 A}. If a function f: B R satis es the additive Cauchy functional equation (11) for all x, y A, then f can be uniquely extended onto R to an additive function g such that g(x) = f(x) for all x B. By virtue of the previous theorems, we get the following new results. Proposition 2: For a function f: [0, ] [0, ], the follow- ing statements are equivalent. 1) f satis es the additive Cauchy functional equation (11) for all x, y [0, ].

BACZY NSKI AND JAYARAM: DISTRIBUTIVITY OF FUZZY IMPLICATIONS OVER NILPOTENT OR STRICT TRIANGULAR CONORMS 593 2) Either f = , or f = 0, or f(x) =  0, if x = 0, , if x > 0, x [0, ] (14) or f(x) =  0, if x < , , if x = , x [0, ] (15) or there exists a unique constant c (0, ) such that f admits the representation (13) for all x [0, ]. Proof: 2) = 1) It is a direct calculation that all the previous functions satisfy (11). 1) = 2) Let f: [0, ] [0, ] satisfy (11). Setting x = y = 0 in (11), we get f(0) = f(0) + f(0), so f(0) = 0, or f(0) = . If f(0) = , then for any x [0, ], we get f(x) = f(x + 0) = f(x) + f(0) = f(x) + = and thus, we obtain the rst possible solution f = . Now, setting x = y = in (11), we get f( ) = f( ) + f( ). Therefore, f( ) = 0 or f( ) = . If f( ) = 0, then for any x [0, ], we have 0 = f( ) = f(x + ) = f(x) + f( ) = f(x) + 0 = f(x) and thus, we obtain the second possible solution f = 0. Let us assume that f = and f = 0. Considering the alter- nate cases earlier, we get f(0) = 0 and f( ) = . De ne a set Z = {x (0, ) | f(x) = }. If Z = , then Z = (0, ). Indeed, let us x some real x0 Z and take any x (0, ). If x x0, then we get f(x) = f((x x0) + x0) = f(x x0) + f(x0) = f(x x0) + = . If x < x0, then there exists a natural k 2 such that kx > x0. From the previous point, we get that f(kx) = . Further, by the induction, we obtain = f(kx) = f(x + (k 1)x) = f(x) + f((k 1)x) = k-times f(x) + + f(x) = kf(x) and thus, f(x) = . This implies, with the assumptions f(0) = 0 and f( ) = , that if Z = , then we obtain the third pos- sible solution (14). On the other hand, if Z = , then f(x) [0, ) for x [0, ). By Theorem 7, for A = B = [0, ), f can be uniquely extended to an additive function g: R R, such that g(x) = f(x) for all x [0, ). Consequently, g is bounded below on the set [0, ). Further, g is an additive function bounded above on [0, ). Since any additive function is convex, by virtue of theorem of Bernstein Doetsch (see [11] or [22, Coro. 6.4.1]), g is continuous, and hence, g is continuous. Now, by Theorem 6, there exists a unique constant c R such that g(x) = cx for every x R, i.e., f(x) = cx for every x [0, ). Since the domain and the range of f are nonnegative, we see that c 0. If c = 0, then we get the fourth possible solution (15), because of our assumption f( ) = . If c > 0, then we obtain the last possible solution (13), since c = = f( ). Corollary 1: For a continuous function f: [0, ] [0, ], the following statements are equivalent. 1) f satis es the additive Cauchy functional equation (11) for all x, y [0, ]. 2) Either f = , or f = 0, or there exists a unique constant c (0, ) such that f admits the representation (13) for all x [0, ]. Theorem 8 ([22, Th. 13.6.2]): Fix a real a > 0. Let A = [0, a], and let H R2 be the set H = {(x, y) R2 | x A, y A, and x + y A}. (16) If f: A R is a function satisfying (11) on H, then there exists a unique additive function g: R R such that g(x) = f(x) for all x A. Moreover, the closed interval [0, a] may be replaced by any one of these intervals (0, a), [0, a), and (0, a]. Proposition 3: Fix real a, b > 0. For a function f: [0, a] [0, b], the following statements are equivalent. 1) f satis es the functional equation f(min(x + y, a)) = min(f(x) + f(y), b) (17) for all x, y [0, a]. 2) Either f = b, or f = 0, or f(x) =  0, if x = 0, b, if x > 0, x [0, a] (18) or there exists a unique constant c [b/a, ) such that f(x) = min(cx, b), x [0, a]. (19) Proof: 2) = 1) It is obvious that f = 0 and f = b satisfy (17). Let f have the form (18). If x = y = 0, then the left side of (17) is equal to f(min(0 + 0, a)) = f(0) = 0 and the right side of (17) is min(f(0) + f(0), b) = min(0 + 0, b) = 0. If x = 0 or y = 0, then the both sides of (17) are equal to b. Finally, if f has the form (19) with some c [b/a, ), then the left side of (17) is equal to f(min(x + y, a)) = min(c min(x + y, a), b) = min(c(x + y), ca, b) = min(c(x + y), b), x, y [0, a] since ca b. Now, the right side of (17) is equal to min(f(x) + f(y), b) = min(min(cx, b) + min(cy, b), b) = min(cx + cy, cx + b, cy + b, b + b, b) = min(c(x + y), b), x, y [0, a] which ends the proof in this direction. 1) = 2) Let f satisfy (17). Setting x = y = 0 in (17), we get f(0) = min(f(0) + f(0), b). (20) Authorized licensed use limited to: INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS. Downloaded on June 2, 2009 at 23:08 from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 594 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 17, NO. 3, JUNE 2009 If f(0) = b, then for any x [0, a], we have f(x) = f(min(x + 0, a)) = min(f(x) + f(0), b) = min(f(x) + b, b) = b and thus, we obtain the rst possible solution f = b. Now, let us substitute x = y = a in (17). We have f(a) = min(f(a) + f(a), b). (21) If f(a) = f(a) + f(a), then f(a) = 0 and for every x [0, a], we get 0 = f(a) = f(min(a + x, a)) = min(f(a) + f(x), b) = min(f(x), b) and therefore, f(x) = 0, and we obtain the second possible solution f = 0. Let us assume that f = 0 and f = b. Considering the alternate cases in (20) and (21), we get that f(0) = 0 and f(a) = b. Let us de ne x0 = inf{x [0, a] | f(x) = b}. First, we will show that if x0 < a, then f(x) = b, x (x0, a]. (22) Indeed, let us take any x (x0, a]. From the de nition of the element x0, there exists x1 (x0, x] such that f(x1) = b. Further f(x) = f(x1 + (x x1)) = f(min(x1 + (x x1), a)) = min(f(x1) + f(x x1), b) = min(b + f(x x1), b) = b. Thus, if x0 = 0, then we get the third possible solution (18). Let us assume, that x0 > 0. Now we show, that for any x, y [0, x0) such that x + y [0, x0), the function f is ad- ditive, and therefore, it satis es (11). Suppose that this does not hold, i.e., there exist x1, y1 [0, x0) such that x1 + y1 [0, x0) and f(x1 + y1) = f(x1) + f(y1). Setting x = x1 and y = y1 in (17), we get f(x1 + y1) = f(min(x1 + y1, a)) = min(f(x1) + f(y1), b) = b. However, x1 + y1 < x0, which is a contradiction to the de nition of x0. We proved that f satis- es the additive Cauchy functional equation (11) on the set H de ned by (16) for A = [0, x0). By Theorem 8, the function f can be uniquely extended to an additive function g: R R, such that g(x) = f(x) for all x [0, x0). Consequently, g is bounded on [0, x0), and by virtue of theorem of Bernstein Doetsch (see [11] or [22, Th. 6.4.2]), g is continuous. Because of Theorem 6, there exists a unique constant c R such that g(x) = cx for every x R, i.e., f(x) = cx for every x [0, x0). Since the domain and the range of f are nonnegative, we get that c 0. Moreover lim x x 0 f(x) = lim x x 0 cx = cx0 b and consequently, c [0, b/x0]. If we assume that c [0, b/x0), then we get f(x0) = f x0 2 + x0 2  = f min x0 2 + x0 2 , a  = min f x0 2  + f x0 2  , b  = min cx0 2 + cx0 2 , b  = min(cx0, b) = cx0 < b since c < b/x0. Hence, if x0 = a, then we get a contradiction to our assumption f(a) = b. If x0 (0, a), then there exists x1 (0, x0) such that cx0 + cx1 < b. Setting x = x0 and y = x1 in (17), we get, by (22), that b = f(min(x0 + x1, a)) = min(f(x0) + f(x1), b) = min(cx0 + cx1, b) = cx0 + cx1 which contradicts the previous assumption. Consequently, we showed that if f = 0 and f = b and x0 (0, a], then there exists a unique c = b/x0 b/a such that f(x) =  cx, if x x0, b, if x > x0, x [0, a]. Easy calculations show that for x [0, a], we have f(x) =  cx, if b x0 x b b, if b x0 x > b =  cx, if cx b b, if cx > b = min(cx, b) i.e., f has the last possible representation (19). Corollary 2: Fix real a, b > 0. For a continuous function f: [0, a] [0, b], the following statements are equivalent. 1) f satis es the functional equation (17) for all x, y [0, a]. 2) Either f = 0, or f = b, or there exists a unique constant c [b/a, ) such that f has the form (19). Theorem 9 ([22, Th. 13.1.6]): Let D be one of the sets (0, 1), [0, 1), [0, ), (0, ), R. For a continuous function f: D R, the following statements are equivalent. 1) f satis es the multiplicative Cauchy functional equation (12) for all x, y D. 2) Either f = 0, or f = 1, or f has one of the following forms: f(x) = |x|c, x D f(x) = |x|c sgn(x), x D with a certain c R. If 0 D, then c > 0. Corollary 3: For an increasing bijection h: [0, 1] [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) h satis es the multiplicative Cauchy functional equation (12) for all x, y [0, 1]. 2) There exists a unique constant c (0, ), such that h(x) = xc for all x [0, 1]. Corollary 4: For an increasing bijection h: [0, 1] [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. Authorized licensed use limited to: INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS.

For x = 0 or z = 1, the function h also satis es previous equa- tion, since h(0) = 0 and h(1) = 1. By virtue of Corollary 3, we get the thesis. 2) = 1) This implication is obvious. III. ON THE EQUATION (4) WHEN S1, S2 ARE STRICT T-CONORMS Our main goal in this section is to present the representa- tions of some classes of fuzzy implications that satisfy (4) when S1, S2 are strict t-conorms. Within this context, we rstly de- scribe the general solutions of (4) when S1, S2 are strict t- conorms. It should be noted that the general solutions of the distributive equation F(x, G(y, z)) = G(F(x, z), F(y, z)) where F is continuous and G is assumed to be continuous, strictly increasing and associative were presented by Acz el (see [1, Th. 6, p. 319]). Our results can be seen as a generalization of the previous result without any assumptions on the function F and less assumptions on the function G. Theorem 10: Let S1, S2 be strict t-conorms. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing func- tions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 ad- mit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and for every xed x [0, 1], the vertical section I(x, ) has one of the following forms: I(x, y) = 0, y [0, 1] (24) I(x, y) = 1, y [0, 1] (25) I(x, y) =  0, if y = 0, 1, if y > 0, y [0, 1] (26) I(x, y) =  0, if y < 1, 1, if y = 1, y [0, 1] (27) I(x, y) = s 1 2 (cx s1(y)) , y [0, 1] (28) with a certain cx (0, ) that is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant, depending on con- stants for s1 and s2. Proof: 2) = 1) Let t-conorms S1, S2 have the represen- tation (5) with some continuous and strictly increasing func- tions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] such that s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = . By Theorem 1 and part 2) of Remark 2, the functions S1, S2 are strict t-conorms. Let us x arbitrarily x [0, 1]. We consider ve cases. If I(x, y) = 0 for all y [0, 1], then the left side of (4) is I(x, S1(y, z)) = 0 and the right side of (4) is S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(0, 0) = 0 for all y, z [0, 1]. If I(x, y) = 1 for all y [0, 1], then the left side of (4) is I(x, S1(y, z)) = 1, and the right side of (4) is S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(1, 1) = 1 for all y, z [0, 1]. Let I(x, y) have the form (26) for all y [0, 1]. Fix arbitrarily y, z [0, 1]. If y = 0, then the left side of (4) is I(x, S1(0, z)) = I(x, z) and the right side of (4) is S2(I(x, 0), I(x, z)) = S2(0, I(x, z)) = I(x, z). Analogously, if z = 0, then both sides of (4) are equal to I(x, y). If y > 0 and z > 0, then S1(y, z) > S1(0, 0) = 0 since S1 is strict. Now, the left side of (4) is I(x, S1(y, z)) = 1, and the right side of (4) is S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(1, 1) = 1. Let I have the form (27) for all y [0, 1]. Fix arbitrarily y, z [0, 1]. If y = 1, then the left side of (4) is I(x, S1(1, z)) = I(x, 1) = 1, and the right side of (4) is S2(I(x, 1), I(x, z)) = S2(1, I(x, z)) = 1. Analogously, if z = 1, then both sides of (4) are equal to 1. If y < 1 and z < 1, then S1(y, z) < S1(1, 1) = 1 since S1 is strict. Now, the left side of (4) is I(x, S1(y, z)) = 0, and the right side of (4) is S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(0, 0) = 0. Let I have the form (28) for all y [0, 1]. Fix arbitrarily y, z [0, 1]. If y, z [0, 1), then we have I(x, S1(y, z)) = I(x, s 1 1 (s1(y) + s1(z))) = s 1 2 (cx(s1(y) + s1(z))) S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2  s 1 2 (cxs1(y)) , s 1 2 (cxs1(z))  = s 1 2  s2 s 1 2 (cxs1(y)) + s2 s 1 2 (cxs1(z))  = s 1 2 (cxs1(y) + cxs1(z)) = s 1 2 (cx(s1(y) + s1(z))) = I(x, S1(y, z)) since s1(y) < and s1(z) < . If y = 1 or z = 1, then I(x, S1(y, z)) = S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = 1. Finally, let us assume that, for some x [0, 1], the vertical sec- tion is given by (28). We know, by Theorem 1, that s1, s2 are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants. We show that, in this case, the constant cx in (28) depends on pre- vious constants. To prove this, let a, b (0, ) be xed and as- sume that s 1(x) = as1(x) and s 2(x) = bs2(x) for x [0, 1]. By Theorem 1, functions s 1 and s 2 are also continuous additive gen- erators of S1 and S2, respectively. Let us de ne c x := (b/a)cx.

From Theorem 1 and part 2) of Remark 2, the t-conorms S1 and S2 admit the representation (5) for some continuous additive generators s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] such that s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = . Moreover, both generators are uniquely determined up to positive multiplica- tive constants. Now, (4) becomes I  x, s 1 1 (s1(y) + s1(z))  = s 1 2 (s2(I(x, y)) + s2(I(x, z))) (29) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. Let x [0, 1] be arbitrary but xed. De ne a function Ix: [0, 1] [0, 1] by the formula Ix(y) = I(x, y), y [0, 1]. By routine substitutions, hx = s2 Ix s 1 1 , u = s1(y), v = s1(z), for y, z [0, 1], from (29), we obtain the additive Cauchy functional equation hx(u + v) = hx(u) + hx(v), u, v [0, ] where hx: [0, ] [0, ]. By Proposition 2, we get either hx = , hx = 0, or hx(u) =  0, if u = 0 , if u > 0 for u [0, ], or hx(u) =  0, if u < , if u = for u [0, ], or there exists a constant cx (0, ) such that hx(u) = cx u, for u [0, ]. Because of the de nition of the function hx, we get either Ix = 1, or Ix = 0, or Ix(y) =  0, if y = 0 1, if y > 0 for y [0, 1], or Ix(y) =  0, if y < 1 1, if y = 1 for y [0, 1], or Ix(y) = s 1 2 (cx s1(y)) for y [0, 1] and with cx (0, ). We show that in the last case, the constant cx is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on constants for s1 and s2. Let s 1(x) = as1(x) and s 2(x) = bs2(x) for all x [0, 1] and some a, b (0, ). Further, let c x be a constant in (28) for s 1, s 2. If we assume that s 1 2 (cx s1(y)) = s 1 2 (c x s 1(y)) then we get s 1 2 (cx s1(y)) = s 1 2 c x s 1(y) b  and therefore, cx s1(y) = c x a s1(y) b and thus, when y = 0, we get c x = b acx. Remark 3: From the previous proof, it follows that if we assume that S1 = S2 and for some x [0, 1], the vertical sec- tion I(x, ) has the form (28), then the constant cx is uniquely determined. Since we are interested in nding solutions of (4) in the fuzzy logic context, we can easily obtain an in nite number of solutions that are fuzzy implications. It should be noted that, with this assumption, the vertical section (24) is not possible, while for x = 0, the vertical section should be (25). Also, a fuzzy implication is decreasing in the rst variable while it is increasing in the second one. Example 1: If S1, S2 are both strict t-conorms, then the great- est solution that is a fuzzy implication is the greatest fuzzy implication [5]: I1(x, y) =  0, if x = 1 and y = 0 1, otherwise. The vertical sections are the following: For x [0, 1), this is (25), and for x = 1, this is (26). Example 2: If S1, S2 are both strict t-conorms, then the least solution that is a fuzzy implication is the least fuzzy implication [5]: I0(x, y) =  1, if x = 0 or y = 1 0, otherwise. The vertical sections are the following: For x = 0, this is (25), and for x (0, 1], this is (27). A. Continuous Solutions for I in (4) With Strict T-Conorms From the previous result, we are in a position to describe the continuous solutions I of (4). Theorem 11 (cf. [1]): Let S1, S2 be strict t-conorms. For a continuous function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing func- tions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = , which are uniquely determined up Authorized licensed use limited to: INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS.

BACZY NSKI AND JAYARAM: DISTRIBUTIVITY OF FUZZY IMPLICATIONS OVER NILPOTENT OR STRICT TRIANGULAR CONORMS 597 to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 ad- mit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and ei- ther I = 0, or I = 1, or there exists a continuous function c: [0, 1] (0, ), uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on constants for s1 and s2, such that I has the form I(x, y) = s 1 2 (c(x) s1(y)) , x, y [0, 1]. (30) Proof: 2) = 1) It is obvious that all functions I described in 2) are continuous. By previous general solution, they satisfy our functional equation (4) with strict t-conorms S1, S2 generated from s1 and s2, respectively. 1) = 2) From Theorem 10, we know what are the possible vertical sections for the xed x [0, 1]. Since I is continuous, for every x [0, 1], the vertical sections are also continuous, and consequently, the vertical sections (26) and (27) are not possible. Let us assume that there exists some x0 [0, 1] such that I(x0, y) = 0 for all y [0, 1], i.e., the vertical section for x0 is (24). In particular, I(x0, 1) = 0, but for the other possible vertical sections, we always have I(x, 1) = 1; therefore, the only possibility in this case is I = 0. Analogously, let us assume that there exists some x0 [0, 1] such that I(x0, y) = 1 for all y [0, 1] i.e., the vertical section for x0 is (25). In particular, I(x0, 0) = 1, but for the other pos- sible vertical sections, we always have I(x, 0) = 0; therefore, the only possibility in this case is I = 1. Finally, assume that, for all x [0, 1], the vertical sections Ix = 0 and Ix = 1. This implies that the vertical section is (28). Therefore, there exists a function c: [0, 1] (0, ) such that I has the form (30). This function c is continuous since for any xed y (0, 1), it is a composition of continuous functions c(x) = s2(I(x, y)) s1(y) , x [0, 1]. From the previous formula, one can immediately obtain, that the function c is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant, depending on constants for s1 and s2. Example 3: If we assume that S1 = S2 and the function c = 1 in (30), then our solution is trivial I(x, y) = s 1 (c(x) s(y)) = s 1 (s(y)) = y, x, y [0, 1]. This function is not a fuzzy implication. Since (4) is the generalization of a tautology from the classical logic involving Boolean implication, it is reasonable to expect that the solution I of (4) is also a fuzzy implication, but from Theorem 11, we obtain the following result. Corollary 5: If S1, S2 are strict t-conorms, then there are no continuous solutions I of (4) that satisfy (I3). Proof: Let a continuous function I satisfy (I3) and (4) with some strict t-conorms S1, S2 with continuous additive genera- tors s1, s2, respectively. Then, I has the form (30) with a con- tinuous function c: [0, 1] (0, ), but in this case, we get I(0, 0) = s 1 2 (c(0) s1(0)) = s 1 2 (c(0) 0) = s 1 2 (0) = 0 and therefore, I does not satisfy the rst condition in (I3). B. Noncontinuous Solutions of (4) With Strict T-Conorms From Corollary 5, it is obvious that we need to look for solutions that are not continuous at the point (0, 0), and we explore this case now. Theorem 12: Let S1, S2 be strict t-conorms and let a func- tion I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] be continuous except at the point (0, 0), which satis es (I3) and (NC). Then, the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing func- tions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 ad- mit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and a continuous function c: [0, 1] (0, ] with c(x) < for x (0, 1], c(0) = that is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant, depending on constants for s1 and s2, such that I has the form I(x, y) =  1, if x = y = 0 s 1 2 (c(x) s1(y)) , otherwise (31) for all x, y [0, 1]. Proof: 2) = 1) It is obvious that S1, S2 are strict t-conorms. Moreover, the function I de ned by (31) is continuous except at the point (0, 0) and satis es (I3) and (NC), since I(0, 0) = 1 I(x, 1) = s 1 2 (c(x) s1(1)) = s 1 2 ( ) = 1, x [0, 1] I(0, x) = s 1 2 (c(0) s1(x)) = s 1 2 ( ) = 1, x (0, 1]. By our previous general solution, they satisfy our functional equation (4) with strict t-conorms S1, S2 generated from s1 and s2, respectively. 1) = 2) Let us assume that the functions I and S1, S2 are the solutions of (4) satisfying the required properties. From Theorem 10, there exist continuous and strictly increasing functions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = , which are uniquely determined up to pos- itive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 admit the repre- sentation (5) with s1, s2, respectively. Let x (0, 1] be arbitrary but xed. Again from Theorem 10, we get either Ix = 1, or Ix = 0, or Ix(y) = s 1 2 (c(x) s1(y)) for all y [0, 1] and with c(x) (0, ). From the continuity of the function I and the assumptions of I, as shown in the proof of [2, Th. 5], the rst two cases are not possible. Indeed, if we take y = 1, then there are only two possibilities, for any x (0, 1], either Ix(1) = 0, or Ix(1) = 1. However, I1(1) = I(1, 1) = 1 and from the continuity of I on the rst variable (for x > 0 and y = 1), we get Ix(1) = 1 for every x (0, 1], so Ix = 0 for every x (0, 1]. On the other hand, taking y = 0, we also obtain two possibilities, for any x (0, 1], either Ix(0) = 0, or Ix(0) = 1, but I1(0) = I(1, 0) = 0, and from the continuity of I on the rst variable (for x > 0 and y = 0), we get Ix(1) = 0 for every x (0, 1]; therefore, Ix = 1 for every x (0, 1]. We proved that there exists a function Authorized licensed use limited to: INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS. Downloaded on June 2, 2009 at 23:08 from IEEE Xplore. Restrictions apply. 598 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 17, NO. 3, JUNE 2009 c: (0, 1] (0, ) such that I has the form (30). This function c is continuous, since for any xed y (0, 1), it is a composition of continuous functions: c(x) = s2(I(x, y)) s1(y) , x (0, 1]. (32) If x = 0, then using similar steps as in the proof of Theorem 10, we obtain the additive Cauchy functional equation h0(u + v) = h0(u) + h0(v), u, v (0, 1] (33) where the function h0: (0, ] [0, ] de ned by the formula h0 = s2 I0 s 1 1 is continuous (here, I0(y) = I(0, y) for all y [0, 1]). Corollary 2 implies that h0 = , or h0 = 0, or there exists c(0) (0, ) such that h0(u) = c(0) u for u (0, 1]. However h0(1) = s2(I0(s 1 1 (1))) = s2(I(0, 1)) = s2(1) = and therefore, h0 = 0, and the solution h0 = implies c(0) = . Therefore, we get I(0, y) = I0(y) = s 1 2 (c(0) s1(y)) , y (0, 1] (34) and some c(0) (0, ]. We show that c(0) = . From (29), substituting x = 0 and z = 0, it follows that, for all y [0, 1], we have I  0, s 1 1 (s1(y) + s1(0))  = s 1 2 (s2(I(0, y)) + s2(I(0, 0))). Since s1(0) = 0, s1(1) = , and I(0, 0) = 1, we get I(0, y) = 1, y [0, 1]. Let y (0, 1) be xed. By (34), we get 1 = s 1 2 (c(0) s1(y)) thus, c(0) s1(y) = s2(1) = . Since y (0, 1), we obtain that c(0) = . Finally, we must prove the existence of the following limit limx 0+ c(x) = c(0). To this end, we x arbitrarily y (0, 1). From the continuity, limx 0+ I(x, y) = I(0, y). Moreover, s2 is continuous, and therefore lim x 0+ c(x) = lim x 0+ s2(I(x, y)) s1(y) = s2(limx 0+ I(x, y)) s1(y) = s2(I(0, y)) s1(y) = s2(1) s1(y) = s1(y) = = c(0) and c is a continuous function. Remark 4: The function I in the previous theorem can also be written in the form I(x, y) = s 1 2 (c(x) s1(y)) , x, y [0, 1] with the convention that 0 = 0 = . From the previous proof, we see that a function I given by (31) with a continuous function c satis es conditions (I3). Ad- ditionally, by the increasing nature of continuous generators s1 and s2, we get that I is increasing with respect to the second variable. Unfortunately, we can say nothing about its mono- tonicity with respect to the rst one. The next result solves this by showing some necessary and suf cient conditions. Corollary 6: If S1, S2 are strict t-conorms and I is a fuzzy implication that is continuous except at the point (0, 0), then the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing func- tions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0 and s1(1) = s2(1) = , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 ad- mit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and a continuous, decreasing function c: [0, 1] (0, ] with c(x) < for x (0, 1], c(0) = , uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on con- stants for s1 and s2, such that I has the form (31) for all x, y [0, 1]. We would like to underline the main difference between Theorem 12 and the previous result. In Corollary 6, we have the assumption that I is a fuzzy implication in the sense of De nition 3. Example 4: One speci c example is the function c(x) = 1/x for all x [0, 1], with the assumption that 1/0 = . In this case, the solution I is the following: I(x, y) = 1, if x = y = 0 s 1 2  1 x s1(y)  , otherwise for all x, y [0, 1]. In the special case when s1 = s2, i.e., S1 = S2, we obtain the function from the Yager s class of g-generated fuzzy implications (see [34, p. 202]). IV. ON THE EQUATION (4) WHEN S1, S2 ARE NILPOTENT T-CONORMS In this section, our main goal is to present the characteriza- tions of the classes of fuzzy implications that satisfy (4) when S1, S2 are both nilpotent t-conorms, but we rst describe the general solutions of (4) when S1, S2 are nilpotent t-conorms. From this result, we again show that there are no continuous fuzzy implications I that are solutions for (4) for nilpotent t- conorms and, hence, proceed to investigate noncontinuous so- lutions for I obeying (4). Theorem 13: Let S1, S2 be nilpotent t-conorms. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing functions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0, s1(1) < and s2(1) < , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 admit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and for every xed x [0, 1], the vertical section I(x, ) has one of the following forms: I(x, y) = 0, y [0, 1] (35) I(x, y) = 1, y [0, 1] (36) I(x, y) =  0, if y = 0, 1, if y > 0, y [0, 1] (37) Authorized licensed use limited to: INDIAN INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY MADRAS.

BACZY NSKI AND JAYARAM: DISTRIBUTIVITY OF FUZZY IMPLICATIONS OVER NILPOTENT OR STRICT TRIANGULAR CONORMS 599 I(x, y) = s 1 2 (min(cx s1(y), s2(1))) , y [0, 1] (38) with a certain cx [s2(1)/s1(1), ) uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on con- stants for s1 and s2. Proof: 2) = 1) Let t-conorms S1, S2 have the representa- tion (5) with some continuous and strictly increasing functions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0, s1(1) < , and s2(1) < . By Theorem 1 and part 3) of Remark 2, the functions S1, S2 are nilpotent t-conorms. Let us x arbitrarily x [0, 1]. We consider four cases. If I(x, y) = 0 for all y [0, 1], then the left side of (4) is equal to I(x, S1(y, z)) = 0, and the right is equal to S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(0, 0) = 0 for all y, z [0, 1]. If I(x, y) = 1 for all y [0, 1], then the left side of (4) is equal to I(x, S1(y, z)) = 1, and the right is equal to S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(1, 1) = 1 for all y, z [0, 1]. Let I(x, y) have the form (37) for all y [0, 1]. Fix ar- bitrarily y, z [0, 1]. If y = 0, then the left side of (4) is equal to I(x, S1(0, z)) = I(x, z), and the right is equal to S2(I(x, 0), I(x, z)) = S2(0, I(x, z)) = I(x, z). Analogously, if z = 0, then both sides of (4) are equal to I(x, y). If y > 0 and z > 0, then S1(y, z) min(S1(y, y), S1(z, z)) > min(y, z) > 0 since S1 is nilpotent, i.e., continuous and Archimedean. Now, the left side of (4) is equal to I(x, S1(y, z)) = 1, and the right is equal to S2(I(x, y), I(x, z)) = S2(1, 1) = 1. If I has the form (38) for all y [0, 1] with some cx [s2(1)/s1(1), ), then one can check, similar to the proof of Theorem 10, that the triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4). Finally, let us assume that, for some x [0, 1], the vertical section is given by (38). We know, by Theorem 1, that continuous additive generators s1, s2 are unique up to a positive multiplica- tive constant. We show that, in this case, the constant cx in (38) depends on previous constant. To prove this, let a, b (0, ) be xed and assume that s 1(x) = as1(x) and s 2(x) = bs2(x) for all x [0, 1]. By Theorem 1, functions s 1 and s 2 are also contin- uous additive generators of t-conorms S1 and S2, respectively. Let us de ne c x := (b/a)cx. For all y [0, 1], we get s 1 2 (min(c x s 1(y), s 2(1))) = s 1 2  min  b acx as1(y), bs2(1)  = s 1 2 (b min(cx s1(y), s2(1))) = s 1 2 b min(cx s1(y), s2(1)) b  = s 1 2 (min(cx s1(y), s2(1))) i.e., the vertical section for s1, s2, and cx is the same as for s 1, s 2, and c x. 1) = 2) Let us assume that functions S1, S2, and I are the solutions of the functional equation (4) satisfying the required properties. Then, from Theorem 1 and part 3) of Remark 2, the t-conorms S1 and S2 admit the representation (5) for some continuous additive generators s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] such that s1(0) = s2(0) = 0, s1(1) < , and s2(1) < . Moreover, both generators are uniquely determined up to positive mul- tiplicative constants. Now, (4) becomes, for all x, y, z [0, 1] I  x, s 1 1 (min(s1(y) + s1(z), s1(1)))  = s 1 2 (min(s2(I(x, y)) + s2(I(x, z)), s2(1))). (39) Fix arbitrarily x [0, 1] and de ne a function Ix: [0, 1] [0, 1] by the formula Ix(y) = I(x, y), y [0, 1]. By routine substitutions, hx = s2 Ix s 1 1 , u = s1(y), v = s1(z) for y, z [0, 1], from (39), we obtain the following func- tional equation, for u, v [0, s1(1)]: hx(min(u + v, s1(1))) = min(hx(u) + hx(v), s2(1)) where the function hx: [0, s1(1)] [0, s2(1)]. By Proposition 3, we get either hx = s2(1), hx = 0, or hx(u) =  0, if u = 0 s2(1), if u > 0 for u [0, s1(1)], or there exists a constant cx [s2(1)/s1(1), ) such that hx(u) = min(cx u, s2(1)), for u [0, s1(1)]. Because of the de nition of the function hx we get either Ix = 1, Ix = 0, or Ix(y) =  0, if y = 0 1, if y > 0 for y [0, 1], or Ix(y) = s 1 2 (min(cx s1(y), s2(1))) for y [0, 1] and with cx [s2(1)/s1(1), ). We show that, in the last case, the constant cx is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on constants for s1 and s2. Let s 1(x) = as1(x) and s 2(x) = bs2(x) for all x [0, 1] and some a, b (0, ). Further, let c x be a constant in (38) for s 1, s 2. If we assume that s 1 2 (min(cx s1(y), s2(1))) = s 1 2 (min(c x s 1(y), s 2(1))) then we get s 1 2 (min(cx s1(y), s2(1))) = s 1 2 min(c x as1(y), bs2(1)) b  and therefore min(cx s1(y), s2(1)) = min c x as1(y) b , s2(1)  and thus, whenever cx s1(y) < s2(1), we have cx s1(y) = c x a s1(y) b . Therefore, if y = 0, then we get c x = (b/a)cx. Remark 5: From the previous proof, it follows that if we assume that S1 = S2 and for some x [0, 1], the vertical sec- tion I(x, ) has the form (38), then the constant cx is uniquely determined.

Restrictions apply. 600 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 17, NO. 3, JUNE 2009 We can easily obtain an in nite number of solutions that are fuzzy implications. It should be noted that, with this assumption, the vertical section for x = 0 should be (36). Example 5: If S1, S2 are both nilpotent t-conorms, then the greatest solution of (4), which is a fuzzy implication, is the greatest fuzzy implication I1. Example 6: If S1, S2 are both nilpotent t-conorms, then the least solution of (4), which is a fuzzy implication, is the following: I(x, y) =  1, if x = 1 s 1 2 min s2 (1) s1 (1) s1(y), s2(1)  , if x < 1. In the special case, when s1 = s2, i.e., S1 = S2, then we obtain the following fuzzy implication: I(x, y) =  1, if x = 1 y, if x < 1 which is also the least (S, N)-implication (see [7, Ex. 1.5]). A. Continuous Solutions of (4) With Nilpotent T-Conorms Similar to the proofs of Theorems 11 and 13, we can deduce the following result. Theorem 14: Let S1, S2 be nilpotent t-conorms. For a con- tinuous function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1], the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing functions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0, s1(1) < and s2(1) < , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 admit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and either I = 0, or I = 1, or there exists a continuous function c: [0, 1] [s2(1)/s1(1), ), uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on constants for s1 and s2, such that I has the form I(x, y) = s 1 2 (min(c(x) s1(y), s2(1))) (40) for all x, y [0, 1]. Corollary 7: If S1, S2 are nilpotent t-conorms, then there are no continuous solutions I of (4) that satisfy (I3). Proof: Let a continuous function I satisfy (I3) and (4) with some nilpotent t-conorms S1, S2 with continuous additive gen- erators s1, s2, respectively. Then, I has the form (40) with a con- tinuous function c: [0, 1] [s2(1)/s1(1), ), but in this case, we get I(0, 0) = s 1 2 (min (c(0) s1(0), s2(1))) = s 1 2 (min(0, s2(1))) = 0 and therefore, I does not satisfy the rst condition in (I3). B. Noncontinuous Solutions of (4) With Nilpotent T-Conorms From Corollary 7, it is obvious that we need to look for solutions that are not continuous at the point (0, 0). Using similar methods as earlier, we can prove the following fact. Theorem 15: Let S1, S2 be nilpotent t-conorms and let a func- tion I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] be continuous except at the point (0, 0), which satis es (I3) and (NC). Then, the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing functions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0, s1(1) < and s2(1) < , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 ad- mit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and a continuous function c: [0, 1] [s2(1)/s1(1), ] with c(x) < for x (0, 1], c(0) = , uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on con- stants for s1 and s2, such that I has the form I(x, y) =  1, if x=y=0 s 1 2 (min (c(x)s1(y), s2(1))) , otherwise (41) for x, y [0, 1]. Remark 6: The function I in the previous theorem can also be written in the form I(x, y) = s 1 2 (min (c(x)s1(y), s2(1))) , x, y [0, 1] with the convention that 0 = 0 = . It can easily be veri ed that a function I given by the formula (41) with a continuous function c satis es conditions (I3). Ad- ditionally, by the increasing nature of continuous generators s1 and s2, we get that I is increasing with respect to the second variable, but we can say nothing about its monotonicity with respect to the rst one. The next result solves this by showing some necessary and suf cient conditions. Corollary 8: Let S1, S2 be nilpotent t-conorms and I be a fuzzy implication that is continuous except at the point (0, 0). Then, the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist continuous and strictly increasing functions s1, s2: [0, 1] [0, ] with s1(0) = s2(0) = 0, s1(1) < and s2(1) < , which are uniquely determined up to positive multiplicative constants, such that S1, S2 admit the representation (5) with s1, s2, respectively, and a con- tinuous decreasing function c: [0, 1] [s2(1)/s1(1), ] with c(x) < for x (0, 1], c(0) = , uniquely deter- mined up to a positive multiplicative constant depending on constants for s1 and s2, such that I has the form (41) for all x, y [0, 1]. Here again, we would like to underline the main difference between Theorem 15 and the previous result. In Corollary 8, we have the assumption that I is a fuzzy implication in the sense of De nition 3.

BACZY NSKI AND JAYARAM: DISTRIBUTIVITY OF FUZZY IMPLICATIONS OVER NILPOTENT OR STRICT TRIANGULAR CONORMS 601 assumption that 1/0 = . In this case, the solution I is the following: I(x, y) = 1, if x = y = 0 s 1 2  min  1 x s1(y), s2(1)  , otherwise = s( 1) 2  1 x s1(y)  for all x, y [0, 1]. In the special case when s1 = s2, i.e., S1 = S2, we obtain the function from the Yager s class of g-generated fuzzy implications (see [34, p. 202]). Quite evidently, there are other candidates for the function c, viz., c(x) = 1 + 1/x or c(x) = 1/x2 for x [0, 1]. V. ON (4) WHEN I IS AN R-IMPLICATION In this section, we discuss the distributive equation (4) when I is an R-implication obtained from a continuous Archimedean t-norm T. The case when T is a nilpotent t-norm has been investigated by Balasubramaniam and Rao in [10]. The result from this paper can be written in the following form. Theorem 16 [10, Th. 4]: Let S1, S2 be t-conorms. For an R- implication I obtained from a nilpotent t-norm, the following statements are equivalent. 1) The triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) S1 = S2 = max. In [10], we can nd the following sentence . . . the authors have a strong feeling that it holds for the case when the R- implication is obtained from a strict t-norm . . .. We will show in this section that this is not true, i.e., for an R-implication generated from a strict t-norm, there exist other solutions than maximum. We start our presentation with some connections between solutions S1, S2 of (4) and the properties of R-implications. Lemma 1: Let S1, S2 be t-conorms and I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] be a function that satis es the left neutrality property (NP). If a triple of functions S1, S2, I satis es the functional equation (4), then S1 = S2. Proof: Let I satisfy (NP). Putting x = 1 in (4), we get I(1, S1(y, z)) = S2(I(1, y), I(1, z)), y, z [0, 1] and thus S1(y, z) = S2(y, z), y, z [0, 1]. Hence, S1 = S2. Note that the previous result is true for any binary operations S1 and S2. Lemma 2: Let S1, S2 be continuous Archimedean t-conorms, and let I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] be a function that satis es the ordering property (OP). If S1, S2, I satisfy the functional equation (4), then S2 is a nilpotent t-conorm. Proof: Since S1 is a continuous Archimedean t-conorm, from part 1) of Remark 1, for every y (0, 1), we have S1(y, y) > y. Let us x any y (0, 1) and take some x (y, S1(y, y)). By (OP), we get I(x, y) = y0 < 1, whereas from (4), we obtain 1 = I(x, S1(y, y)) = S2(I(x, y), I(x, y)) = S2(y0, y0). Hence, by part 2) of Remark 1, the t-conorm S2 is nilpotent. Since an R-implication I generated from left-continuous t- norm satis es (NP) and (OP), from previous Lemma 1, we have S1 = S2 in (4), and hence, it suf ces to consider the following functional equation: I(x, S(y, z)) = S(I(x, y), I(x, z)), x, y, z [0, 1]. (42) Further, from Lemma 2, we get the following. Corollary 9: Let S be a continuous Archimedean t-conorm, and let I be an R-implication generated from some left- continuous t-norm. If the couple of functions S, I satis es the functional equation (42), then S is nilpotent. Corollary 10: An R-implication I obtained from a left- continuous t-norm does not satisfy (4), when S1 and S2 are both strict t-conorms. From previous investigations, it follows that we should con- sider the situation when S is a nilpotent t-conorm. As a result, we obtain the following theorem. Theorem 17: For a nilpotent t-conorm S and an R-implication I generated from a strict t-norm, the following statements are equivalent. 1) The couple of functions S, I satis es the functional equa- tion (42) for all x, y, z [0, 1]. 2) There exist , which is uniquely determined, such that S admits the representation (8) with and I admits the representation (10) with . Proof: 2) = 1) Assume that there exists a , such that S admits the representation (8) with and I admits the representation (10) with , i.e., S(x, y) = 1(min( (x) + (y), 1)), x, y [0, 1] and I(x, y) = 1, if x y, 1  (y) (x)  , if x > y, x, y [0, 1]. We will show that I and S satisfy (42). Let us take any x, y, z [0, 1]. The left side of (42) is equal to I(x, S(y, z)) = I(x, 1(min( (y) + (z), 1))) = 1, if x 1(min( (y)+ (z), 1)) 1 min( (y) + (z), 1) (x)  , otherwise = 1, if (x) min( (y) + (z), 1) 1  min  (y) + (z) (x) , 1 (x)  , otherwise = 1, if (x) (y) + (z) 1  (y) + (z) (x)  , otherwise.

Because of Theorem 3, there exists a unique such that S has the form (8). In fact, the increasing bijection can be seen as a continuous generator of S. Further, by virtue of Theorem 5, there exists , uniquely determined up to a positive constant exponent, such that I(x, y) = 1, if x y 1  (y) (x)  , if x > y x, y [0, 1]. (43) It is obvious that I is a fuzzy implication that is continuous except at the point (0, 0). Therefore, if functions S, I satisfy the functional equation (42), then from Corollary 8, there exists a continuous decreasing function c: [0, 1] [1, ], with c(x) < for x (0, 1] and c(0) = , such that I(x, y) =  1, if x = y = 0 1 (min (c(x) (y), 1)) , otherwise (44) for x, y [0, 1]. Let us take any x (0, 1]. From (43), for any y < x, we have I(x, y) < 1, whereas from (44), we have that I(x, y) = 1 (c(x) (y)). Hence, from the continuity of I (for x > 0), we get 1 = I(x, x) = lim y x I(x, y) = lim y x 1(c(x) (y)) and therefore, c(x) (x) = 1 for x (0, 1]. This implies that c(x) = 1 (x) < (45) for x (0, 1]. Observe that c is a continuous decreasing function from (0, 1] to [1, ). Moreover, this formula can be considered also for x = 0, since = c(0) = 1/ (0) = 1/0, i.e., c is well de ned. Now, comparing (43) with (44) and setting (45) in (44), we obtain the functional equation 1  1 (x) (y)  = 1  (y) (x)  for x, y [0, 1] and x > y. By substitutions, hx = 1, u = (x), and v = (y), we obtain the functional equation h v u  = h(v) h(u), u, v [0, 1], u > v. From Corollary 4, we get that there exists a unique constant c (0, ) such that h(u) = uc. By the de nition of h, we get 1(u) = uc, thus (x) = ( (x))c for all x [0, 1]. Since the increasing bijection is uniquely determined up to a positive constant exponent, we get that I admits the representation (10) also with . Example 8: Taking = id[0,1], we obtain the interesting example that the ukasiewicz t-conorm and the Goguen impli- cation satisfy the distributive equation (42). VI. CONCLUSION Recently, in [10] and [32], the authors have studied the dis- tributivity of R- and S-implications over t-norms and t-conorms. But the distributive equation (4) for R-implications obtained from strict t-norms was not solved. In this paper, we have char- acterized a function I that satis es the functional equation (4), when S1, S2 are either both strict or nilpotent t-conorms. Us- ing the previous characterizations, we have shown that for an R-implication I generated from a strict t-norm T, we have the following. 1) Equation (4) does not hold when t-conorms S1, S2 are strict. 2) Equation (4) holds if and only if t-conorms S1 = S2 are -conjugate with the ukasiewicz t-conorm for some in- creasing bijection , which is a multiplicative generator of the strict t-norm T. It is established that in the cases when I is an S-implication or an R-implication, most of the equations (1) (3) hold only when the t-norms and t-conorms are either min or max. That the gen- eralization (4) has more solutions in the case of R-implications obtained from strict t-norms is bound to have positive impli- cations in applications, especially in the new research area of inference invariant rule reduction. Also as part of characterizing (4), we have obtained a more general class of fuzzy implications [see (31)] that contains the Yager s class [34] as a special case. In our future works, we will try to concentrate on some cases that are not considered in this paper, for example, when S1 is a strict t-conorm and S2 is a nilpotent t-conorm, and vice versa.
