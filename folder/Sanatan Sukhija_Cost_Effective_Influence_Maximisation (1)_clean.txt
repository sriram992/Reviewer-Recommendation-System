Topologically, the nodes in the core of a network are the most e cient spreaders. However, these nodes are less susceptible, i.e., unlikely to be in uenced by the periphery nodes. Consequently, large payo s are required to market information (ideas, products, memes, etc.) via them. In this paper, we show the presence of several non-core nodes whose spreading power is close to that of the core nodes. In the 4 real-world datasets under consideration, the number of such nodes is 7 times more than the number of core nodes on average. Given a limited budget, digital marketers can target such non-core nodes to advertise their products with lesser payo s. Moreover, from a sociological perspective, interpersonal closeness can help in reducing the payo further. With the help of friendship connections, we propose a cost-e ective strategy to reach the in uential nodes. The proposed hill-climbing based strategy can be e ectively used with both, global as well as local characteristics of the nodes in a network. In terms of the cost metric, it outperforms the conventional independent cascade model by more than 5 times for the core and 2 times for the non-core super-spreaders. Index Terms In uence maximisation, Information di usion, Virality, Core-periphery structure I. Introduction Over the last two decades, researchers have investigated the reasons behind What makes a meme go viral on social networks? . In the Ted talk How Videos go Viral? [1], YouTube s trends manager Kevin Allocca emphasised the importance of tastemakers (highly followed celebrities or in uential identities) in viralising the YouTube videos. The research problem of identifying such super-spreaders [16] has attracted a lot of attention lately. Formally known as the in uence maximisation problem , it aims at identifying k {1, 2, 3, . . . } most e cient spreaders in a network. The large body of research literature in this domain includes optimisation algorithms [12], analysis of network topology [13], and studies based on real-world meme di usion data [18] etc. Predominantly, in addition to the content of a meme, the connections of its spreaders play an important role in deciding its virality [7]. To make a meme go viral, the super-spreaders in a network need to be in uenced. An analysis of spreading patterns on Twitter has shown that the super-spreaders tend to be the most in uential people [4] such as popular celebrities, prominent political leaders etc. However, in comparison to the common mass, these super-spreaders cannot be in uenced easily [2]. In this paper, we show that, in addition to the scarce in uential super-spreaders, there exist numerous other e cient spreaders in real-world networks. We term such super-spreaders as pseudo-in uentials . These nodes have a spreading power equivalent to that of the most in uential super-spreaders. We propose algorithms to nd a chain of connections ( friends of friends of friends... ) to make a meme reach the most e cient spreaders. The experiments on several real-world datasets suggest that the proposed algorithm is more e ective as compared to the conventional information spreading strategies. The major contributions of the paper are listed below. 1) Proving the presence of numerous non-core super- spreaders in real-world social networks. 2) Proposed a cost-e ective strategy to make a meme reach the super-spreaders without the need for global information.

Related Work Understanding the spreading of information [8; 9; 11] in online social networks is a problem of high signi cance.

Animal Interaction Network have been used to solve the in uence maximisation problem like approximation algorithms, network structure, budget minimisation [6], centrality measures and speci cally coreness [3] (k-shell decomposition [13]). In many real-world scenarios, people are eager to achieve the desired in uence maximization with limited time and low budget, where a minimum seed set is taken with constrained time and in uence, known as budget minimizing problem. For a long time, the scienti c community has considered the core nodes in a network as the super-spreaders and the periphery nodes are considered to be the seeds as they are easy to approach. Pei et al. [18] proposed the sum of degrees of neighbors (degree sum) of a node as a proxy for the coreness of a node in a network. Many other measures like leader rank [17], cluster rank [5] etc. have been proposed for calculating the spreading power of nodes in a network. Although the k-shell decomposition algorithm and its local variants identify the core nodes, this alone is not su cient for super-spreading the information. This is because the core nodes are non-susceptible and do not readily spread a piece of information. In this regard, Gupta et al. [10] used a hill-climbing based approach to reach the core nodes in the network which creates a path from the periphery nodes to core nodes in the network. This approach is similar to the Milgram s small world experiment aimed at passing a letter from a source person to the target person through a chain of acquaintances [19]. However, unlike the Milgram experiment, the target in their approach is a set of nodes (core) instead of just one person. As Klein eld speci ed that the success rate of Milgram s experiment was very low [14] when the targets were low-status people and vice versa. Being based on the shell number of nodes, the hill-climbing approach proposed by Gupta et al. required the global information of the network. Further, they did not consider the possibility of a person in the chain not forwarding the meme further. We address both of these limitations in our work. III. Pseudo-Influentials The current study revisits the idea of identifying super- spreaders using the k-shell decomposition algorithm. A k- core of a graph G is its maximal connected subgraph in which all vertices have degree at least k. We consider a node to have coreness/shell-number c, if it belongs to c- core but not (c + 1)-core. We show that the spreading power does not increase at every successive shell in the network. There are several consecutive shells whose di usion capacity (spreading power) is equivalent to that of the core. A schematic plot for this behaviour is shown in Figure 1. The di usion capacity increases with an increasing shell number until a certain shell q, thereafter stabilising. This proves the existence of a set of non-core super-spreading nodes that are capable of making a post viral. Hereafter, we call such super-spreaders as pseudo- core (or pseudo-in uentials). A. Cascading Power of Pseudo-cores For nding the spreading power of a shell k, we calculate the spreading power of the nodes in this shell using Independent Cascade [8] model. Given a network G, the spreading power p(u) of a node u is calculated using 100 simulations of independent cascade model with u as the seed node and the infection probability p. The spreading power of node u, p(u), is de ned as the average of number of infected nodes over 100 iterations. The spreading power of shell k, k p is de ned as the average spreading power of all nodes in this shell. k p =  v (k) p(v) | (k)|                 !" 91 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

The spreading (cascading) power of each shell for 4 real- world networks[15] (Facebook, Email interaction, Weblog and Animal Network) is shown in Figure [2, 3, 4, 5] respectively, where X-axis corresponds to the shell number (k) and Y-axis represents ( k p) for varying values of p. It can be observed that the spreading power saturates much before the core is encountered. Furthermore, the standard deviation of the cascading power of a shell decreases with increasing shell number. This indicates that the nodes in the core/pseudo-core, unlike the periphery nodes, have equivalent spreading power. B. Cascading power of individual pseudo-in uential nodes Figure 6 depicts the spreading power of the periphery, core, pseudo-core, and non-pseudo-core shell nodes. Fig. 6. Spreading power of nodes in various shells. The X-axis corresponds to the nodes. Y-axis represents the average and standard deviation of the spreading power (100 experiments). The X-axis in the plots represent the nodes in a particular shell (Please note that this number will vary across di erent shells). Y-axis shows the average p(u) and the standard deviation p(u) of the spreading power of nodes. It is observed that p(u) for the nodes in non-core and non-pseudo-core shells is higher as compared to the core and pseudo-core shells. Further, it is seen that the nodes of core and pseudo-core shells have similar spreading power as opposed to the other nodes. IV. Cost Effective Influence Maximisation Assume a company wants to advertise its product through the super-spreaders of a network. These super- spreaders such as celebrities will demand a payo for the endorsement. As Interpersonal closeness (IC) plays an important role in in uencing an individual,we propose an alternate cost-e cient strategy for super-spreading that does not involve directly approaching the super-spreaders. Instead of targeting the core/pseudo-core nodes directly in the network, the proposed strategy chooses an individual in the lower-most shell to start the information spread. Thereafter, the company pays a reward r to the person u for each infected edge Euv in the network. The rewarding process continues until the product/meme reaches a core/pseudo-core node. Hence, the overall cost incurred by the company is r (the number of infected edges). We propose an approach that greatly reduces the advertising cost as compared to the conventional information di usion strategy (referred to as the baseline model hereafter). 1) Baseline Model: We use a variant of the conventional independent cascade model as the baseline model. In the experiment, information di usion starts from a seed node, say u V (G) where V (G) is the vertex set of the underlying graph G. For each edge (u, v) there is a probability, pu,v [0, 1] of information propagation across the edge. At each time step t N, each node in the G is in one of the states; infected (the node infected in the current iteration which attempts to infect its neighbors for one iteration), susceptible (a node which has not been infected before) or inactive (a node which has been infected before and has tried infecting its neighbors, thereafter achieving an inactive state). In each iteration, every infected node tries infecting its susceptible neighbors with a probability p, thereafter becoming inactive. The experiment stops when either a) there are no infected nodes in the network or b) the information cascade reaches a super-spreader. 2) Proposed Model: In the baseline model, an infected node infects all of its neighbors. This increases the number of edges explored leading to an increase in the payo . The proposed model introduces a controlled behavior in the experiment. To reach a core or a pseudo-core node, instead of infecting all the neighbors, each node tries infecting                 !" 92 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

If it fails to infect the most in uential neighbor, it tries infecting the neighbor having the second-highest spreading power and so on. The experiment continues until a core/pseudo-core node is infected. We use shell numbers of the nodes as a measure of the spreading power. Using Proxies (Local Measures): In real-world practice, calculating the shell number of neighbors is impractical because of the unavailability of the entire network. However, many proxies can be used as the approximation for the shell number of a node. We perform our experiments with these proxies, namely, degree, degree sum of neighbors and h-index. The cost for all experiments is calculated in the same manner as that of the baseline model. From Table I, it can be observed that in comparison to the baseline, the proposed strategy takes signi cantly less number of edges to reach a core and a pseudo-core shell. The other important observations from the conducted experiments are listed below. For both, the conventional as well as the proposed model, the number of edges explored to reach a pseudo-core node is signi cantly lesser than that of a core node. The proposed hill-climbing based strategy explores a lesser number of edges to reach a core/pseudo-core node as compared to the conventional approach. For most experiments; when the target is a core node, the hill-climbing approach when used with shell number outperforms all other proxies. For most experiments; when the target is a pseudo- core node, the hill-climbing approach when used with proxies, namely, h2-index and degree-sum, outperforms the shell-number based climbing. From our experiments, we conclude that; despite not knowing the path to reach the super-spreaders, one can still in uence them with the proposed hill-climbing based strategy with the discussed proxies. The information will go viral as soon as a super-spreader shares it upon being in uenced. V. Conclusion The study leverages the core-periphery structure in real- world social networks to show the presence of a large number of non-core nodes that can spread the information as e ectively as a core node. A cost-e ective information di usion strategy has been proposed that only requires the neighborhood information (friendship connections) of a node to make a meme go viral. Digital marketing agencies with a limited advertising budget can use the proposed strategy to popularise their product. One limitation of the proposed approach is the assumption of an equal cost for every infected edge. However, for each node, an impact of both, the susceptibility and in uence-ability can be considered. References [1] Allocca, K. Why videos go viral. Ted talk (2011). [2] Aral, S., and Walker, D.
