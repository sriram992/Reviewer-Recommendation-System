Khurana & Pramod Kumar Rai Received: 10 October 2016 /Accepted: 3 April 2017 # Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017 Abstract Water contamination has reached an alarming state due to industrialization and urbanization and has become a worldwide issue. Dyes contaminate water and are addressed extensively by researchers. Various tech- nologies and materials have been developed for the treatment of contaminated water. Among them, adsorp- tion has attracted great attention due to its ease and cost-effective nature. In recent years, graphene-based composites have shown great potential for the removal of contaminants from water. The literature reveals the usefulness of composites of graphene with metal oxides, carbon derivatives, metal hybrids and polymers for the removal of organic dyes from contaminated water. In this review, efforts have been made to compile the studies on the removal of cationic and anionic dyes from water using graphene-based composites. Keywords Adsorption . Composites .

Rapid industrialization and urbaniza- tion have resulted in significant increase in generation of wastewater which contains various toxicants such as dyes, heavy metals, chlorinated hydrocarbons, biologi- cal contaminants, explosives, radioactive nucleotides and toxic anions. Organic dyes, a common water pol- lutant, are used in textile, rubber, paper, plastic, food and printing industries. Dyes are mostly stable due to their complex molecular structure and, therefore, do not bio- degrade readily. Synthetic dyes are usually toxic, carci- nogenic and mutagenic and are stable to temperature, light and microbial attacks (Barka et al. 2011). Dyes enter the food chain through water bodies and cause adverse effects on both human and animal health (Mohanty et al. 2006). Around 15% of the dye is lost during the dyeing process; therefore, the removal of dyes from contaminated water has become an issue of significant importance worldwide (Houas et al. 2001). Researchers have reviewed the removal of dyes using adsorbents and environmental applications of graphene-based composites (L et al. 2012; Bharathi and Ramesh 2013). Previously various techniques such as nanofiltration (Chakraborty et al. 2003), photodegradation (Kant et al. 2014), oxidation (Neamtu et al. 2004), biological treat- ment (El-Naas et al. 2009), adsorption (Idris et al. 2011) and liquid membrane separation (Daas and Hamdaoui 2010) have been developed for the degradation and removal of toxic dyes from contaminated water. Commercial activated carbon has been frequently Water Air Soil Pollut (2017) 228:180 DOI 10.1007/s11270-017-3361-1 I. Khurana : A. Saxena : Bharti : P. K.

Khurana Department of Chemistry, University of Delhi, Delhi 110007, India employed by dye manufacturing industries because of its high surface area and porosity for the removal of dyes (Carrott et al. 1991). In the last decade, various adsor- bents derived from agricultural and solid wastes have also received extensive attention (Rehman et al. 2012). Nanomaterials such as metal oxides, graphene and carbon nanotubes have given a new prospect to the pollutant management. Graphene, a one-atom-thick 2D layer sp2-hybridized carbon, is the most intensively studied material in the world because of its exceptional electrical, mechanical, optical and chemical properties. Graphene has emerged as a useful nanoadsorbent for environmental applications because of its high theoret- ical surface area (~2620 m2 g 1) (Novoselov et al. 2004, 2012). Abundant oxygen-containing functional groups have been incorporated in graphene to get graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (RGO) (Haubner et al. 2010). GO is mainly synthesized by the Staudenmaier method (Yang et al. 2013a) and Hummers /modified Hummers method (Moradi et al. 2015). The presence of surface functionalities makes GO a promising material for environmental applications (Kemp et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2011). The electrostatic interactions of the adsorbate with the graphene and GO make them the materials of choice for adsorption of charged species (Ramesha et al. 2011). Three-dimensional reduced graphene oxide macrostruc- tures have been utilized for dye removal (Kim et al. 2015). Exfoliated graphene oxide (EGO) and RGO were used for the removal of orange G (OG) (Ramesha et al. 2011). The usage of either GO or RGO for effective adsorption depends on the charge on the dye. The literature revealed that GO-based composites have been utilized for the removal of cationic and anionic dyes (Fig. 1). These composites with metal oxides, carbon derivatives, metal hybrids or polymers are synthesized mostly by solvo-thermal synthesis (Sun et al. 2011), hy- drothermal process (Ghosh et al. 2013b), microwave-assisted route (Liu et al. 2013a), one-step sonochemical route (Chandra et al. 2012), coprecipitation (Deng et al. 2013) and ultrasonication route (Reddy et al. 2015). The recovery of adsorbent after use has always been a challenge; to overcome this, magnetically active graphene-based composites have been synthesized (Lu et al. 2013). The recent proliferation of research into graphene-based hybrid materials is due to their high sur- face area and high porosity. Therefore, efforts have been made in this review to compile the important studies on the removal of various classes of organic dyes from contaminated water using graphene-based composites. 2 Kinetic Models In order to understand the mechanism of adsorption, various theoretical models have been applied on the reaction rate data, namely pseudo-first-order (Lagergren 1898), pseudo-second-order (Ho and Mckay 1999) and intraparticle diffusion kinetic models (Weber and Morris 1963). The kinetic parameters of dye adsorption onto the graphene-based composites are evaluated using these kinetic models. The linear form of Lagergren s pseudo-first-order equation is as follows: log qe qt log qe k1t . 2:303 1 Cationic/ anionic dyes Fig. 1 Dye adsorption on graphene-based material 180 Page 2 of 17 Water Air Soil Pollut (2017) 228:180 where qe (mg g 1) is the amount of adsorbed dye on the adsorbent at equilibrium, qt (mg g 1) is the amount of adsorbed dye on the adsorbent at time (t) and k1 (min 1) is the pseudo-first-order rate constant. The linear form of pseudo-second-order equation is as follows: t qt 1 k2 q2 e t qe 2 where qe (mg g 1) is the amount of adsorbed dye on the adsorbent at equilibrium, qt (mg g 1) is the amount of adsorbed dye on the adsorbent at time (t) and k2 (g mg 1 min 1) is the pseudo-second-order rate constant. The model having a correlation coefficient (R2) value closer to 1 for the linear regression plots and closer experimental and calculated qe values is used for explaining the adsorption mechanism. In case, the pseudo-first-order model does not fit the experimental data well and then the pseudo-second-order model is used to explain the kinetics of the adsorption process. Literature reveals that generally, the adsorption ki- netics for cationic and anionic dye removal by graphene-based nanocomposites follow the pseudo-second-order model (Rotte et al. 2014), al- though there are cases where the kinetics is well ex- plained by the pseudo-first-order model (Wang et al. 2015a). Pseudo-second-order model assumes that chemisorption occurs; generally, the rate of direct adsorption/desorption process controls the sorption kinetics. In order to understand the diffusion process of adsorptive onto the substrate, an intraparticle diffusion model proposed by Weber and Morris is utilized. Equation (3) represents the intraparticle diffusion. qt ki t0:5 C 3 where qt (mg g 1) is the amount of adsorbed dye on the adsorbent at time (t), ki (mg g 1 min 0.5) is the intraparticle diffusion rate constant and C is constant. The intraparticle diffusion model is used to under- stand the transport of adsorbate from the bulk solution phase to the surface pores of adsorbent. This gives the required information about the steps involved in the adsorption process. The adsorption mechanism is quite complex including the chemisorption and physisorption process when the value of C is not equal to zero. The adsorption kinetics is only controlled by intraparticle diffusion if C = 0. However, in most of the cases, the value for the constant (C) is non zero. Hence, the ad- sorption of dye onto the substrate is controlled by both film and intraparticle diffusions. 3 Adsorption Models Adsorption models are helpful to understand the inter- actions between adsorptive molecules and adsorbents, and the distribution of these molecules between the liquid and solid phases at the equilibrium state. It plays an essential role in the optimization of the adsorbent usage for the selective removal of toxicants. The two majorly used models are Langmuir and Freundlich iso- therm models. The best fit isotherm model is selected based on the value of correlation coefficient (R2). The Langmuir adsorption is based on the assumption that a monolayer adsorption of adsorbate takes place over a homogeneous adsorbent surface. No transmigration of the adsorbate on the surface plane occurs. The Langmuir isotherm is represented as Ce Qe 1 QMKL Ce QM 4 where Ce (mg L 1) is the concentration of adsorptive at equilibrium, Qe (mg g 1) is the amount of adsorbed dye on the adsorbent at equilibrium, KL (L mg 1) is the Langmuir constant and QM (mg g 1) is the Langmuir monolayer adsorption capacity. The values of QM and KL are calculated from the slope and intercept of the linear plot for the Langmuir model (Ce/qe vs Ce). The dimensionless separation factor (RL) is used to describe the characteristics of Langmuir isotherm. It is represented as follows: RL 1 1 KLCo 5 where Co (mg L 1) is the initial dye concentration, KL (L mg 1) is the Langmuir constant and RL is the sepa- ration factor. The possible RL values explain whether the adsorp- tion is favourable, unfavourable, linear or irreversible adsorption. If the value lies between 0 and 1, it repre- sents favourable adsorption, RL > 1 represents Water Air Soil Pollut (2017) 228:180 Page 3 of 17 180 unfavourable adsorption, RL = 1 corresponds to linear adsorption and RL = 0 represents irreversible adsorption. The Freundlich adsorption isotherm model is based on the assumption that adsorbent surface is heteroge- neous and multilayer adsorption takes place on its sur- face. The linear form of Freundlich adsorption isotherm model is as follows: log Qe log K F 1 n log Ce 6 where Qe (mg g 1) is the equilibrium adsorption capac- ity of adsorbent, Ce (mg L 1) is the equilibrium adsorp- tive concentration, KF (mg 1 1 n L 1 n g 1) is the Freundlich constants indicative of adsorption and 1/n is the Freundlich constants indicative of adsorption en- ergy distribution. The intercept and slope of the plot of log (Qe) vs log (Ce) give the values of KF and 1/n. The values of 1/n between 0 and 1 indicate the adsorption intensity or surface heterogeneity. The value below 1 is indicative of normal Langmuir isotherm; however, the value above 1 corresponds to cooperative adsorption. As the hetero- geneity increases, the value of 1/n tends to become 0. Most of the dye removal has followed the Langmuir model (Fan et al. 2012; Ai et al. 2011; Deng et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013a, 2014; Yang et al. 2013a; Zhao et al. 2015a; Kim et al. 2015; Bian et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2015) over the Freundlich model (Ai and Jiang 2012). However, a few authors have reported that adsorption follows both the Langmuir and Freundlich models (Ma et al. 2014). 4 Mechanism of Dye Removal The removal is mostly carried out via either photodegradation or adsorption as depicted in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. Ultra large surface area and strong interaction on the surface of graphene composites are responsible for adsorption (Liu et al. 2012a). Along with the interaction, the electrostatic interaction of oppositely charged functional groups on adsorbate and adsorbent leads to physical adsorption (Sharma and Das 2013; Tiwari et al. 2013). It has also been reported that the adsorption is strongly pH and ionic strength depen- dent, indicating an ion exchange mechanism (Fan et al. 2012). Better electrostatic interaction takes place be- tween the negatively charged surface of GO sheets due to the presence of oxygen functionalities and the posi- tively charged cationic dyes (Ma et al. 2014). Therefore, some materials are more efficient for adsorption of cationic dyes over anionic dyes (Kim et al. 2015). Besides adsorption, photodegradation or catalytic degradation of dyes has been carried out for rendering toxic dyes non-toxic. Chen et al. (2015) have discussed a general mechanism of photodegradation of organic dyes using -Bi2O3-graphene composites. On irradia- tion of visible light, e in the valence band (VB) of -Bi2O3 get excited to its CB, and as a result, holes (h+) are generated in the VB of -Bi2O3 simultaneously. As graphene is a good e acceptor and conductor, it promotes the effective separation of e h+ pairs which lead to swift transfer of the photogenerated electrons to the surface of graphene sheets. The photogenerated holes are available to react with OH to produce OH radicals. The holes that are generated in the VB of - Bi2O3 are transferred to the VB of graphene. Hence, the lifetime of the holes increases, leading to the dye deg- radation process. These hydroxyl radicals are proposed to be the major active species responsible for the dye degradation. The photogenerated holes are the minor active species. The combined effect of the hydroxyl radicals and photogenerated holes leads to the oxidation of the organic dye pollutant to CO2, H2O and other small molecule compounds. Zinc-based composites have also been widely used for dye degradation. RGO-ZnO is one such composite e - h + h CB VB Dye Degraded Product Graphene/ metal oxide Photodegradation Fig. 2 Photodegradation mechanism of dyes using graphene/ metal oxide composites 180 Page 4 of 17 Water Air Soil Pollut (2017) 228:180 used for the degradation of methylene blue dye (Luo et al. 2012). The photocatalytic activity of this compos- ite on illumination of UV light is explained by the authors via formation of photogenerated charge pairs (e h+). The reaction of adsorbed O2 and photogenerated electrons leads to the formation of O 2 and OH radicals, resulting into the photodegradation of the dye. The remaining holes in ZnO take part in the redox reactions in the photocata- lytic process. 4.1 Removal of Cationic Dyes 4.1.1 Removal of Methylene Blue Methylene blue (MB) is a cationic dye, which is used for dyeing silk, cotton and wool. MB poses harmful effects on human health such as diarrhoea, vomiting, increased heart rate, jaundice, quadriplegia, shock and cyanosis, and making its removal is necessary (Chen et al. 2011). MB can be removed from the contaminated water using various technologies and materials. Carbon allotropes like activated carbon, GO, RGO and carbon nanotubes without any loadings have shown appreciable removal efficiencies against MB (Kim et al. 2015; Li et al. 2013a). Pristine carbon nanostructures (CNTs, RGO, carbon dots, activated carbon, etc.) have also been utilized for the removal of MB (Kim et al. 2015; Li et al. 2013a). Ramesha et al. (2011) have indicated 50% removal efficiency of RGO for cationic dyes. GO nanostructures (Liu et al. 2012a) and 3D RGO-based hydrogels (Tiwari et al. 2013) have also shown MB removal efficiencies to be 99.1 and 100%, respectively. The electrostatic attraction between graph- ite oxide and the dye was found to be responsible for the adsorption (Bradder et al. 2011). The kinetics of remov- al followed a pseudo-second-order model (Ma et al. 2014; Liu et al. 2012a). In order to enhance the sorption capacities of graphene, various composites of graphene have been prepared and studied for the efficient removal of MB (Table 1). Zinc has been widely used to prepare composites with graphene. Zinc oxide nanorods indicated 66% photodegradation efficiency against MB, whereas its composite with RGO (RGO-ZnONR) indicated 99% efficiency (Nipane et al. 2015). A similar increase in degradation efficiencies was also observed with zinc oxide nanoparticles/RGO (ZnO-NPs/RGO) (Azarang et al. 2014) and RGO-hierarchical ZnO (RGO-ZnO) hollow sphere composites under UV (Luo et al. 2012). R G O - Z n O n a n o h y b r i d s d e m o n s t r a t e d superior photoactivity for the decolorization of self-photosensitized dyes under visible light (Liu et al. 2012b). Hybrid 3D structures composed of zinc oxide nanorods and reduced graphene oxide hydrogel were also reported for the removal of MB dye (Luan et al. 2015). Magnetic ZnFe2O4/graphene (ZnFe2O4/G) com- posite has shown dual function: first, as a catalyst for photoelectrochemical degradation of dyes, and second, as the generator of a strong oxidant hydroxyl radical via photoelectrochemical decomposition of H2O2 under vis- ible light irradiation (Lu et al. 2013). ZnFe2O4/G com- posite indicated complete degradation of MB, and its excellent magnetic property has made it a magnetically recyclable material. Bi2S3-ZnS/graphene complexes could remove 50% MB (Liu et al. 2015). Yoon et al. (2015) synthesized graphene, charcoal, ZnO and ZnS/ BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) hybrid microspheres. Ten mole percent of ZnS or ZnO with BiOI was found to be the most promising composite for MB adsorption from mixed dye solutions. Magnetic graphene composites, for facile recycling of the catalyst, have been utilized for the removal of MB. Graphene nanosheets (GNSs)/magnetite (Fe3O4) showed the adsorption capacity of ~15 mg g 1 (Ai et al. 2011), whereas Deng et al. (2013) showed the maximum sorption capacity as 64.23 mg g 1 using magnetic GO (MGO). The kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order model in both the cases (Ai et al. 2011; Deng et al. 2013). Mei et al. (2015) observed 71.6% degradation using MnO2/G nanocomposite. Vinothkannan et al. (2015) showed that stacking, Adsorption Dye Graphene based composite Fig. 3 Adsorption of dyes on high-surface-area graphene-based composites Water Air Soil Pollut (2017) 228:180 Page 5 of 17 180 Table 1 Removal of methylene blue Material Dye concentration Dosage Activity Reference RGO-ZnONR 10 ppm 45 mg in 100 mL Degradation of 99% Nipane et al.

GO-doped NiFe2O4 (GO-NiFe2O4) composite used as photo-Fenton catalyst in the presence of oxalic acid under visible light irradiation that could degrade >96% of MB (Liu et al. 2013b), whereas bare NiFe2O4 with H2O2 failed to degrade the dye. Mn2O3-decorated graphene (Mn2O3-G) nanosheets have been reported as an effective heterogeneous cata- lyst for the photodegradation of organic dyes (Chandra et al. 2012). It exhibited 84% degradation of MB under UV irradiation. Bi2O3-reduced graphene oxide (Bi2O3-RGO, 2 wt%) composite achieved 96% MB degradation efficiency that was only 76% for Bi2O3 (Liu et al. 2013a). Chen et al. (2015) suggested that hydroxyl radicals are the major active species responsi- ble for the degradation of MB on -Bi2O3-graphene nanocomposites. In P25 graphene (P25-GN) nanocom- posite, as the graphene content was increased, visible light absorption intensity and specific surface area also increased, and the removal efficiency reached above 90% (Li et al. 2013b). Rong et al. (2015b) indicated 97.54% removal efficiency due to the synergistic ad- sorption and photodegradation of MB on NiO/GO com- posite. Graphene oxide TiO2 (GO-TiO2) and graphene carbon nanotube TiO2 (G-CNT-TiO2) composites have also been employed for degradation of MB (Filice et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2014b). Graphene SnO2 (G-SnO2) and graphene CdSe (CdSe-G) composites exhibited complete photocatalytic degradation of MB (Seema et al. 2012; Chun et al. 2011). GO-BiOBr (5%) composite showed 98% degra- dation of MB in 30 min (Vadivel et al. 2014). Sodium deoxycholate/graphene oxide (NaDC/GO) composite hydrogels were also reported for MB removal (Wang et al. 2015c). Siddhardha et al. (2014) increased the MB degradation activity of Au (nanoparticles)/graphene up to 17,000 times than un-catalyzed reaction. Ullah et al. (2014) synthesized noble metal-loaded graphene hy- brids, among which the Pt/graphene nanocomposites showed enhanced photocatalytic activities. Polymer composites of RGO and GO have also shown better dye removal properties than their counter parts. RGO/polyacrylamide (RGO/PAM) (Yang et al. 2013a) and sulfonated graphene-enhanced polyvinyl alcohol (SG-PVA) hydrogel (Li et al. 2015) followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics model with adsorption capacity of 1530 and 13.54 mg g 1, respectively. Liu et al. (2014) prepared -cyclodextrin/poly(acrylic acid)/ GO ( -CD/PAA/GO) nanocomposite exhibited excel- lent water dispersibility due to hydrophilic nature and observed maximum adsorption capacity of 247.99 mg g 1 against MB. 4.1.2 Removal of Rhodamine Blue Rhodamine dyes are generally toxic and are soluble in water, methanol and ethanol. Rhodamine blue (RhB) is harmful to human and aquatic life. GO, graphite oxide, thermally reduced graphite oxide and exfoliated graphene oxide alone have shown promising results for the removal of RhB (Ramesha et al. 2011; Guardia et al. 2012; Avetta et al. 2015). Researchers have also explored numerous graphene-based composites for the removal of RhB (Table 2). Pillaring chemically exfoliated graphene oxide with carbon nanotubes has been used as visible light photocatalyst against RhB (Zhang et al. 2010). Reduced graphene oxide-based hydrogels exhibited re- moval capability of 97% for RhB (Tiwari et al. 2013). The magnetic ZnFe2O4/G composite showed excel- lent visible-light photocatalytic activity for the complete degradation of RhB in the presence of H2O2 (Lu et al. 2013). RGO-ZnO composite exhibited an exceptional cyclic performance against RhB with 99% catalyst re- covery over several cycles under simulated sunlight irradiation (Wang et al. 2012). A novel Bi2S3-ZnS/G complex degraded RhB concentrations to 60% of the initial amount (Liu et al. 2015). Graphene, charcoal, ZnO and ZnS/BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) hybrid micro- spheres have been used for the removal of mixture of dyes including RhB (Yoon et al. 2015). RGO-ZnO nanohybrid prepared by a microwave-assisted route demonstrated enhanced photoactivity leading to degra- dation of RhB, under visible light (Liu et al. 2012b). Metal-loaded graphene was prepared for the removal of RhB. Siddhardha et al. (2014) reported that degrada- tion rate of RhB by the Au (nanoparticle)/graphene composite was almost two times faster than that of citrate-capped Au nanoparticles of similar size. A syn- ergistic interplay of pristine gold s electronic relay and stacking of graphene with the dye accounts for its superior activity. The Pt/graphene nanocomposites showed improved photocatalytic activity than bare graphene against RhB (Ullah et al. 2014). Ghosh et al. (2013b) reported 98% RhB degradation in the dark using CdSe-G.

These composites exhibited impressive recyclability and stability. Chen et al. (2013) synthesized Ag3PO4/GO via a liquid-phase deposition method and reported complete degradation of RhB. The author showed that photocatalytic performance of Ag3PO4/ GO was enhanced due to the improved adsorption per- formance and separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers. Ag-I/RGO nanocomposite indicated 96% cata- lytic activity against RhB (Reddy et al. 2015). The photocatalytic performance of GO/Ag3PO4 was greatly enhanced after incorporating GO (Wang et al. 2014a). Researchers prepared magnetically active graphene hybrids because of their facile removal and reusability (Zhao et al. 2015b). Magnetite/reduced graphene oxide (MRGO) nanocomposites showed over 91% removal of RhB (Sun et al. 2011). Ternary P25 graphene Fe3O4 nanocomposite has also been explored for the removal of RhB (Cheng et al. 2016). Singh et al. (2015) reported green one-step alkaline synthesis of strongly bonded G-ZrO2 nanocomposite and removal of 10 ppm RhB. Mn2O3-G nanosheets were synthesized by a simultaneous reduction of potas- sium permanganate along with GO, in which metal ions were first anchored through binding with oxy-functional groups of GO and finally reduced by hydrazine (Chandra et al. 2012). This composite could degrade 60% RhB under UV irradiation. -SnWO4-RGO nano- composites were reported to degrade 91% RhB (Thangavel et al. 2014). SnS2 nanoflakes along with a small amount of SnS2 decorated on RGO sheets (SnS2/ RGO) indicated an adsorption capacity of 94.07 mg g 1 (Bian et al. 2013). The degradation efficiency of GO 5% BiOBr com- posite towards RhB was reported to be 95% (Vadivel et al. 2014). CuI-RGO quasi-shell core nanocomposites improved photocatalytic activities and stabilities for photodegradation of RhB under stimulated solar light irradiation (Choi et al. 2015). The benzene carboxylic acid derivatized GO-zeolite showed the maximum ad- sorption capacities of 67.56 mg g 1. The kinetics follow- ed the pseudo-second-order reaction model. GO nano- sheets were also grafted to acid-treated natural clinoptilolite-rich zeolite powders followed by a cou- p l i n g r e a c t i o n w i t h a d i a z o n i u m s a l t (4-carboxybenzenediazoniumtetrafluoroborate) to the surface of GO (Yu et al. 2013). Adsorption capacity of the composite (carboxy-GO-zeolite) was found to be 67.56 mg g 1, which was higher than pristine natural zeolite and GO-zeolite powders. Three-dimensional GO polyethylenimine porous materials are also active for the removal of 50 ppm RhB (Sui et al. 2013). 4.1.3 Removal of Other Cationic Dyes Carbon materials are extensively used for the removal of cationic dyes such as methyl violet (MV) (Ramesha et al. 2011; Liu et al. 2012a), methyl green (MeG) (Sharma and Das 2013), cationic light yellow 7GL (CLY 7GL) (Yang et al. 2013b), malachite green (MG) (Bradder et al. 2011; Suresh et al. 2015a, b; Ahmad et al. 2014), acridine orange (AcO) (Sun et al. 2012), new fuchsin dye (Roushani et al. 2015) and basic red 12 and basic red 46 (Moradi et al. 2015). Endothermic chemical adsorption through strong stacking and anion cation interaction accounts for ad- sorption (Liu et al. 2012a). Graphite oxide could re- move 351 mg g 1 of MG via electrostatic attraction (Bradder et al. 2011). Adsorption capacity for AcO was reported to be 3.3 g g 1 (Sun et al. 2012). The adsorption capacity of RGO nanosheets against MeG increased while increasing the pH of the medium due to the change in the surface properties (Sharma et al. 2014). The presence of other ions like Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ and SO4 2 also influenced the adsorption property due to the change in the surface properties. Adsorption capacity in the presence of Na+, Ca2+ and Mg2+ was 1.616, 1.562 and 1.436 mmol g 1, respectively. The dye removal efficiencies have been improvised by synthe- sizing composites of graphene (Table 3). MRGO nanocomposite indicated a maximum MG removal efficiency of >94%, and the removal was found to be dependent on the loading percentage of Fe3O4 and pH value (Sun et al. 2011). Li et al. (2015) used sulfonat- ed graphene-enhanced polyvinyl alcohol (SP-PVA) composite hydrogel for the removal of MG and found that the kinetic data best fitted the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The authors declared that SP hydrogels could be used for selective adsorption and separation of the dye mixtures. GO-doped NiFe2O4 (GO-NiFe2O4) was utilized as a photo-Fenton catalyst and was found to be capable of catalyzing the degradation of MG under visible light irradiation and in the presence of oxalic acid (Liu et al. 2013b). Graphene oxide/cellulose bead has been reported as a facile and cost-effective adsorbent with removal effi- ciency of >96% against MG (Zhang et al. 2015). Wang et al. (2013) synthesized magnetic-sulfonic Water Air Soil Pollut (2017) 228:180 Page 9 of 17 180 graphene nanocomposite (G-SO3H/Fe3O4) and ex- plored its potential for the removal of Safranin T (ST), neutral red (NR) and victoria blue. Results revealed there was preferential adsorption of cationic dyes over anionic dyes at pH 6.0. Adsorption kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model with maximum ad- sorption capacity as 216.8 mg g 1 for NR. Chitin/ graphene oxide (Chi/nGO) hybrid gels indicated 57 10 2 mmol g 1 adsorption capacity against NR dye that was only 9.3 10 2 mmol g 1 for chitin (Gonz lez et al. 2015). Water-soluble -cyclodextrin/ poly(acrylic acid)/graphene oxide nanocomposites has been used promisingly up to 5 cycles with 175.49 mg g 1 adsorption capacity against ST (Liu et al. 2014). Graphene oxide tripolyphosphate hybrid (GPM) showed superior results for the adsorption of cationic dyes than anionic dyes (Diagboya et al. 2014). The adsorption was through electrostatic and interactions, and the maximum adsorption ca- pacity was found to be >2540 mg g 1 for cationic dyes. The pH and ionic strength played a major role in the adsorption of methyl blue on magnetic chito- san grafted with graphene oxide (Fan et al. 2012). The adsorption process followed an ion exchange mechanism with maximum adsorption capacity as >90%. Pararosaniline (PA) has been absorbed by superparamagnetic graphene Fe3O4 (G/Fe3O4) nano- composite (Wu et al. 2013). Multilayered MgO- decked graphene (MgO-G) indicated adsorption ca- pacity as 3.92 10 4 mol g 1 against Safranin O (SO) and followed a pseudo-second-order rate equa- tion (Rotte et al. 2014). 4.2 Removal of Anionic Dyes 4.2.1 Removal of Methyl Orange Methyl orange (MO) is highly toxic due to mutagenic properties. It may be fatal if it is swallowed, inhaled or adsorbed through the skin. A variety of materials has been evaluated for the treatment of anionic dye in contaminated water. The selection of RGO and GO for effective adsorption can be ascribed to the charge on the dye, and the maximum removal efficiency of 95% was achieved using RGO against anionic dyes (Ramesha et al. 2011). Table 4 shows graphene-based composites employed for the removal of MO. Zinc with graphene is exten- sively used to remove anionic dyes; e.g. RGO with zinc oxide has been used for the photodegradation of MO (Nipane et al. 2015; Zhang et al. 2013). The degradation efficiency increased from 25 to 78% on clubbing ZnO with RGO (Zhang et al. 2013). Lu et al. (2013) reported 96% photocatalytic degradation of MO using a magnet- ic ZnFe2O4/G composite in the presence of H2O2 under visible light. Graphene, charcoal, ZnO and ZnS/BiOX (X = Cl, Br and I) hybrid microspheres showed potential application for degradation of MO (Yoon et al. 2015). The order of degradation of the dye changed from RhB < MB < MO to MB < RhB < MO while using ZnO/BiOI and ZnS/BiOI. A BiOI-based catalyst was found to be superior to BiOCl and BiOBr. RGO-ZnCdS supramolecular photocatalyst has also been utilized to photocatalytically degrade 10 5 mol L 1 MO (Shen et al. 2015).

(2011) indicated only 6% MO removal, whereas Ghosh et al. (2013b) reported 90% degradation (in the dark) using CdSe-G under different experimental con- ditions. A comparative study was carried out to investi- gate the synergistic effect of graphene on CdSe and TiO2 (Ghosh et al. 2013a). CdSe graphene TiO2 (CdSe-G- TiO2) composite degraded 71% of MO. Chen et al. (2013) achieved 86.7% degradation of MO using Ag3PO4/GO composite and indicated that adsorption performance and separation efficiency of photogenerated carriers were accounted for the enhanced photocatalytic performance. Torres et al. (2013) indicated improved performance of GO-P25 due to the reduction of GO during thermal treatment, which led to the good contact between TiO2 and carbon phases. Flocculent-like TiO2/G has been reported for the decomposition of MO to the tune of >75% (Han et al. 2015). Zhao et al. (2015a) found that 3D G-TiO2 nano- tube composite provided both active sites and electron transport path for its photocatalytic activity against MO. GO and titania hybrid Nafion membranes could re- move 71% of MO (Filice et al. 2015). -SnWO4-RGO nanocomposite indicated excellent photocatalytic activ- ity with degradation efficiency of 90% in a short time against MO (Thangavel et al. 2014). Bi2O3 with 2 wt% RGO achieved a maximum MO degradation efficiency of 93% (Liu et al. 2013a). Wang et al. (2015b) prepared a Cu2O/GO/chitin composite film and observed im- proved photocatalytic activity due to the introduction of GO. The degradation efficiency against 10, 25 and 50 ppm of MO was 92.1, 72.3 and 48.3%, respectively, within 3 h. Yan et al. (2013) also reported the photocat- alytic degradation of MO up to 95% using Cu2O/n- propylamine (PA)/RGO composite. 4.2.2 Removal of Other Anionic Dyes Other anionic dyes besides MO have also been removed by bare GO, RGO, etc. Kim et al. (2015) evaluated a 3D RGO macrostructure alone for the adsorption of acid red 1 and obtained the maximum adsorption capacity of 277.01 mg g 1. Authors also found that the studies followed the pseudo-second-order kinetics and Freundlich models. Ramesha et al. (2011) used EGO and RGO for the removal of OG. Degradation of various other anionic dyes by graphene-based composites is summarized in Table 5.

(2014) prepared GO/chitosan composite fibres and evaluated it against fuchsin acid (FA). The adsorption was spontaneous and exothermic and followed pseudo- second-order kinetics with 175.4 mg g 1 adsorption ca- pacity. Deng et al. (2013) also applied the pseudo-second- order model on the removal of OG by magnetic GO nanocomposite and reported the sorption capacity of 20.85 mg g 1. Gonz lez et al. (2015) observed that the adsorption of Remazol black (RB) on chitin-GO (Chi/ nGO) hybrid gels depends on pH and Chi/nGO propor- tion. Three-dimensional GO polyethylenimine porous materials indicated high adsorption capacity (800 mg g 1) against amaranth (AM) and found it promising for the removal of OG (Sui et al. 2013). Hsieh et al. (2015) reported degradation of acid or- ange 7 (AO7) by Pt-TiO2/G nanocomposites. Pt-TiO2 served as a charge-generating centre while graphene worked as an electron acceptor and transporter in the composite. Wang et al. (2013) utilized magnetic G- SO3H/Fe3O4 for the adsorption of MO, brilliant yellow and alizarin red, and the adsorption followed the pseudo-second-order kinetic model. GPM hybrid has been used for the removal of anionic dyes (MO, alizarin yellow and AM) (Diagboya et al. 2014). GPM showed higher potency for adsorption of cationic dyes as a consequence of and electrostatic interactions. Chandra et al. (2012) removed eosin by Mn2O3-G nano- sheets. Mn3O4-RGO nanohybrids showed 61 and 100% removal against 60 and 30 ppm of orange II (O II), respectively (Yao et al. 2013). Shi et al. (2012) also showed complete removal of O II using well-dispersed Co3O4 nanoparticles over GO. Rong et al. (2015a) revealed the removal of Congo red (CR) using NiO/ GNS. The process was well explained by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model, and the equilibrium data were well fitted by the Redlich Peterson model. The use of poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride)/ GO (PDDA/GO) hydrogels indicated excellent removal efficiencies for Ponceau S (PS) and trypan blue (TB) due to strong stacking and electrostatic interactions ( Wa n g e t a l . 2 0 1 4 c ) . Z e r o v a l e n t i r o n nanoparticle-decorated 3D graphene (3D G-Fe) indicat- ed 94.5% removal of orange IV (O IV) and followed pseudo-first-order degradation kinetics (Wang et al. 2015a). The removal was due to adsorption and redox reaction with activation energy of 39.2 kJ mol 1.

Attempts are being made to further enhance the activity of graphene by mixing/loading it with other materials, e.g. metal oxides, metals, clay, polymers and biological materials. Graphene-based composites have been stud- ied extensively by numerous research groups for the removal of organic dyes from water due to their en- hanced catalytic activities, reusability and facile recov- ery. Zinc-based graphene composites have been exten- sively utilized for the removal of both cationic and anionic dyes. Kinetics data fitted the pseudo- second-order model. These composites removed organ- ic dyes mainly via adsorption, free radical mechanism, photodegradation and electrostatic and interactions. Magnetically active composites of graphene are mate- rials of interest due to the easy and cost-effective sepa- ration techniques. An ideal composite should have high activity, high surface area, easy recovery and excellent stability. During the documentation of this review, it was concluded that light needs to be shed on combining graphene-based systems with other existing water- purifying technologies to improve their efficiency and achieve superior water quality. Partnerships among fun- damental science and engineering development are es- sentially required to improvise the efficacy of treatment technologies.
