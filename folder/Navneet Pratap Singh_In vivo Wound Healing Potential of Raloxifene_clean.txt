ABSTRACT Background: Depletion in estrogen level(s) especially in postmenopausal women is reported to have delayed wound healing effects; hence we have evaluated the wound healing potential of raloxifene in rat model. Objectives: Investigating the wound healing effects of raloxifene nanoemulsion for the management of postmenopausal cutaneous wounds. Materials and Methods: The optimized nanoemulsion gel contains 0.072% raloxifene hydrochloride. Female Wistar rats were used to investigate its wound healing effects. After three months of ovariectomy, wound healing effect was observed in terms of breaking strength, tensile strength, area of wound contraction, wound closure time, hydroxyproline content and histopathological changes. Results: The nanoemulsion gel exhibited better retention (34.31%) than its nanoemulsion. The raloxifene nanoemulsion gel has no erythema and no eschar formation recorded, and it is safe for topical use. In the incision wound model in ovariectomized rats, breaking (898 25g) and tensile strengths (4.47 0.12 g/mm2) in raloxifene treated groups were found to be higher than the untreated control group. Additionally, in ovariectomized rats, wound contraction was found to be 100% in the treated group s following 20 days of post-wounding, where as in control group only 88% was contraction was observed. Also, more hydroxyproline content in raloxifene treated ovariectomized rat was observed that recommend more collagen content than the untreated ovariectomized rat but approximately similar effects to untreated non-ovariectomized rats. Histopathological studies confirmed that the raloxifene treated groups had more re-epithelialization, neo-vascularization, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposition than the control group. Conclusion: These results confirms that the raloxifene nanoemulsion gel has significant wound healing potential, as observed in ovariectomized rats, which will be helpful in postmenopausal cutaneous wound healing.

INTRODUCTION Wound healing, a multi-phase phenomenon consisting of homeostasis, inflammation, proliferation and remodeling.1-5 Although these phases are arbitrary and overlap with each other, but these are affected by various systemic and local factors. Systemic factors that indirectly influence delayed healing response in individuals with diabetes, obesity, stress and old age,6 specifically in elderly women after menopause,7 while in local factors including infection, oxygenation and foreign bodies that directly affect the delayed wound healing locally. Menopause is a biological process that occurs in middle-aged women around age 50 years,8 in whom menstruation ceases which having decreased estrogen levels because of damaged ovarian follicles. Estrogen deficiency induces psychological changes, and postmenopausal women Singh, et al.: Wound Healing Potential of Raloxifene Nanoemulsion Gel for the Management of Postmenopausal Cutaneous Wounds 590 Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research | Vol 56 | Issue 2 | Apr-Jun, 2022 suffer from many health-related problems, including loss of fertility,9 increase risk of osteoporosis,10 atherosclerosis,10,11 and delayed woundhealing.4,12 In postmenopausal women, a variety of healing regimes have been reported for the acceleration of wound healing, but the most important one seems to be the hormone estrogen.13-16 Interestingly, locally bio-available estrogen levels are reported to be altered due to lack of gonadal hormone secretion, which is particularly significant in postmenopausal women.7 The reduction in estrogen levels at the menopausal stage has a delayed cutaneous wound healing effect. This delayed wound healing is linked to skin atrophy, decreased collagen level, decreased water content, and a loss of elasticity.17 Estrogen accelerates healing potential through reducing inflammation, potentiating re-epithelialization, and collagen biosynthesis.18 It also play a crucial role in maintaining dermal thickness, structural integrity and promoting extracellular matrix collagen levels. Previously, selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) were tested for therapeutic potential where identifying the therapeutic effects of estrogen via the estrogen receptor (ER) was the main aim. SERMs are an innovative drug class, with both agonistic and antagonistic effects.19 The two predominant ERs, ER and ER , are differentially expressed in different tissues. The differential expression occurs in the ERs due to the involvement of different co-activators, co-repressor and promoter, which exert tissue-specific estrogenic effects. Raloxifene hydrochloride (RLX), a class of SERMs has been found to be effective for wound healing , especially in ovariectomized rats as similar to postmenopausal women.4,17,20 RLX strongly induces ER expression, while preventing ER expression. The mechanism of action via tissue-specific estrogenic (agonist) or antiestrogenic (antagonist) is related to the structural differences between the raloxifene-ER or -ER complex and the estrogen-ER complex. Furthermore, ex vivo and in vivo studies,4,21 RLX in skin fibroblast cells has proven outcome in collagen biosynthesis, which is an important aspect of effective wound healing. The development of nanoemulsion gel (NE-gel) has been principally focused for their thermodynamic stability, iso-tropical transparency, and dispersion of two immiscible liquids with a combination of oil and water phase, including surfactant and a co-surfactant.22 Droplets having nanoscale size are equipped with enhanced physical properties, optical transparency, solubilization capacity, thermodynamic stability and kinetic parameters. These collectively promotes enhanced Brownian motion and reduced destabilization, including coalescence, creaming and sedimentation.22,23 Interestingly, RLX loaded NE-gel application has been found to be more selective and target localized for the management of wound healing in postmenopausal women. Since due to the minimal metabolic drug disbursement with improved bioavailability, reduced systemic side effects, high penetration into stratum corneum responsible for the intact appearance of RLX within the skin. Moreover, topical application of NE-gel was found to be safe and good alternative for RLX delivery. Also, topical application of a NE-gel delivers localized epidermal sensitivity resulting in wound healing process to elevated thus nourishing the wounded skin more efficiently, as compared to other applications of RLX.24 MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials Reagents and chemicals of analytical grade were purchased from SD Fine Chem Ltd., Mumbai, India. Raloxifene hydrochloride was procured from Cadila Pharma (Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India), as a kind gift for the present study and with their ethical permission. Labrafil M2125CS, Cremophor RH40 and Transcutol P were received from Gattefosse, India for the present study. Animals In this study, female Wistar rats aged 10-weeks were used in experiments (obtained from the animal house at IFTM University, Moradabad, India) and in-housed environment with standard conditions (temperature (24 2 C) and humidity, with 12 hr light and dark period cycles. In addition, they received standard food, rat chow pellets, and water ad libitum. Ethical approval for the present study was received from Animal Ethical Committee, IFTM University, Moradabad, India, with an approval no; 2019/837ac/Ph.D./01 following the OECD guidelines.25,26 A brief sketch of the experiment performed in this study is depicted in Figure 1. Nanoemulsion gel formulation The raloxifene nanoemulsion gel for topical delivery was formulated,27 after selecting the optimized constituents (Labrafil M2125CS, Cremophor RH40 and Transcutol P) with a higher solubility, where O/W nanoemulsion was formulated by using aqueous titration method. Ternary phase diagrams were constructed using obtained titration values to detect the region of nanoemulsion and axis representing phase components. Finally, raloxifene nanoemulsion was found to have 0.072% (w/v) of raloxifene, 14.29% (v/v) of Labrafil M2125CS (oil phase), 33.33% (w/w) of Cremophor Singh, et al.: Wound Healing Potential of Raloxifene Nanoemulsion Gel for the Management of Postmenopausal Cutaneous Wounds Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research | Vol 56 | Issue 2 | Apr-Jun, 2022 591 with acetonitrile: monobasic phosphate buffer (APB, 60:40, v/v), closed with aluminum foil. The assembly was put on a water bath and kept at a temperature of 37 1 C for 8-10 hr with continuous automatic agitation. Raloxifene NE-gel was topically applied on the mounted skin surface and 2 ml of the samples were withdrawn from receiver compartment at fixed time intervals (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 hr). Additionally, similar volume of APB was added to equalize the withdrawn volume from the chambers.25 Moreover, withdrawal samples were diluted with APB for the measurement of RLX spectrophotometrically at 289 nm.15,21 During topical application, the drug usually act locally on skin or within the epidermis, hence minimizing the permeation of drug into the systemic circulation which in turn prevents systemic adverse effects. The cumulative permeated drug area ( g/cm2) was plotted with respect to time and the flux (Jss, g/cm2/hr1) was calculated by dividing the slope and diffusion area mounted skin, herein x-intercept representing lag time (tL, hr). Additionally, the permeability coefficient (Kp, cm hr-1) of the drug through the mounted skin layer in the donor compartment was calculated as follow.28-30 = Flux Permeability coefficient (Kp) (Drug conc. in donor compartment g/ml) = 2 Conc.( g/ml) Volume of diffusion cell Cumulative amount of drug permeated Area (cm ) Skin retention study The retention test was carried out for the determination of raloxifene content, which was retained by the skin. A specific amount of raloxifene must be deposited on the skin for optimal wound healing potential. Following the experiment, skin was excised from the diffusion cell and area was measured. The mounted skin (area of 3.14 cm2) was then washed to remove any excess of the drug, after which it was thinly sliced and vortex in 10 ml of methanol. The skin was then left on a multi-tube vertex shaker (model KVS-50, Electrolab, Mumbai, India) at a temperature of 37 1 C for 24 hr to ensure maximal extraction. After maximum extraction, extracted liquid mixture filtered (0.45 M) and centrifuged (5000 rpm for 5 min) and the amount of retained raloxifene was measured spectrophotometrically (289 nm).15,21 Skin irritation test Skin irritation test of optimized NE-gel was performed for the safety of the formulation through topical application. It was carried out using Wistar rats weighing 225 25 g. Before experimentation, rats were grouped into groups: Group-I Control (NE-gel) and Group-II RH40 and Transcutol P, as a surfactants mixture in a ration of 1:1, and 52.38% (v/v) of distilled water, optimized parameters are mentioned in Table 1. The nanoemulsion was characterized,27 for thermodynamic stability, droplets size, zeta potential, viscosity, refractive index, transmission electron microscopy. Further nanoemulsion was changed into nanoemulsion gel by adding 1% w/w Carbopol 934 for suitability in topical application of RLX. The nanoemulsion gel was characterized,27 for spread ability, viscosity, droplet size, zeta potential. Permeation study Ex vivo permeation profile of raloxifene NE-gel was assessed in rats skin, by using a Franz diffusion apparatus (Meditech Technologies, Chennai, India). Rats (200-250 g) were sacrificed as per OECD guidelines. Hairs on the skin surface were removed using deplinetry cream and complete layers of skin were excised. Subcutaneous tissue and residuals of adhering fat in the dermis were removed by surgery and wiped with isopropyl alcohol, respectively. For the histopathological investigations, rat skin in small pieces of appropriate size was mounted in between the compartments of Franz diffusion apparatus. Total studied area was 3.14 cm2 with a receptor volume of 15 ml. The donor and receiver compartments were filled Figure 1: Scheme of the experimental protocol.

In a unit dose of raloxifene NE-gel contains 0.05 mg of raloxifene applied to the skin surface. The appearance of erythema and eschar formation was monitored visually for 4 days.28 Skin irritation test was predicted by visual inspections and scores were given as follows- 0 : No reaction 1 : Low level erythema or week spotty erythema 2 : Distinct erythema 3 : Moderate erythema- severe erythema 4 : Severe erythema-eschar formation Ovariectomization of the rat At 12-weeks, all the rats were subjected to non- ovariectomized (NOVX) and ovariectomized (OVX). The rats (weighing 200 25 g) were anesthetized using ketamine (0.5 ml kg-1; intraperitoneal injection),9,31,32 back hair were removed using an electric shaver, and the shaved area was cleaned by antiseptic solution containing chlorhexidine and 70% ethanol. Then the povidone- iodine solution was used to disinfect the shaved skin area. At a high degree of aseptic conditions, an incision of 2 cm was made by using surgical scalpel blade (11 no.), on the both sides (right and left) from the middle part of the abdomen.31 After opening the peritoneal cavity, both ovaries were removed and then operated peritoneal cavity layers were stitched by an absorbable suture (Polyglactin 910, Microcryl Fast), whereas incised skin was sutured by using a non-absorbable suture (Ethicon-Mersilk NW5003). The povidone-iodine solution as a disinfectant was applied after stitching on the sutured skin surface.31 After the surgery, rats were housed separately in a rat cage in such a way that they maintained clean and dry sheets using 100% sterilized cotton to avoid hypothermia, prevent contamination, and allow a complete recovery.31 Wound healing activity After 12-weeks of ovariectomization, rats were separated based on treatment into three groups, Group I as Control-OVX (untreated), Group II as Sham-NOVX (untreated) and Group III as OVX (treated with RLX NE-gel, 0.072% w/v) with six rats in each group.33,34 The rats were anesthetized as described above and following the anesthesia, rats were wounded according to the linear incision and circular excision wound model.13 The NE-gel containing RLX 0.05 mg.kg-1,34 was applied topically twice a day until complete healing was achieved. Incision wound model Rats from the different groups were anesthetized and the back hairs were as removed using an electric shaver and again an incision wound (2.5 cm) was made as per details mentioned above. Two para-vertebral linear incisions were made with the full thickness on both sides at a distance 1.5 cm from the vertebral column.35 After incision, both ends of wounds were sutured by using the material detailed above at a 0.5 cm distance. All groups were treated with NE-gel according to the protocol until complete healing was achieved. All sutures and threads were detached on day 12 of post-wounding. On day 16, the breaking and tensile strength,36-39 of wound upon healing was measured through pulling the skin strip up to of wound separation begin with a tensiometer.40,41 = 2 (Breaking strength (g)) Tensile strength (Cross sectional area (mm )) Excision wound model In excision wound model, we have estimated the area of wound contraction and wound healing closure time. Again, rats were anesthetized and a circular (diameter of 16 mm) skin layer was excised dorsally from the thoracic region with the help of 5 mm biopsy punch.42,43 All the wounded areas of each rat were treated according to protocol using NE-gel (RLX, 0.05 mgkg-1), and topically applied (twice in a day) until the complete healing . Post- wounding, the excised wound area was measured at different day s interval (mentioned below) by sketching the wound margin on transparent paper. The changes in the area of wound contraction was calculated using graph paper.44-46 = Wound area on day 0 Wound area on day (n) % of wound contraction 100 Wound area on day 0 Where, n are days (4th, 8th 12th, 14th, 16thand 20th) post wound development. The hydroxyproline assay Hydroxyproline, an amino acid found in collagen and is a major collagen component. It is biosynthesized by post- translational hydroxylation of proline in the presence of prolyl hydroxylase which is among prominent biomarkers to measure the extent of wound healing. Herein, total collagen content was analyzed through estimation of hydroxyproline content in wounded tissues.47 On day 16 of the post-wounding, hydroxyproline content was estimated through a section of healed skin area. Hot air oven was used to dried (at 60 C) the tissues up to constant tissues mass (20 mg) and then was thermo- hydrolyzed (at 120 C) in 5 ml of 6N HCl for 3 hr in covered tubes, whereas acid hydrolysate was neutralized Singh, et al.: Wound Healing Potential of Raloxifene Nanoemulsion Gel for the Management of Postmenopausal Cutaneous Wounds Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research | Vol 56 | Issue 2 | Apr-Jun, 2022 593 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Ex vivo permeation and retention analysis Nanoemulsions were subjected to a penetration study through wounded skin.25 Ideally, the drug s effective concentration would be maintained within the applied area for a long duration to achieve a good therapeutic effect. The flux and permeability coefficient of raloxifene were significantly higher in NE than its NE-gel, suggests a reduced skin permeation rate of NE-gel (Table 2). Upon investigation, retention of raloxifene in the skin was higher in NE-gel (34.31%) as compared to NE (21.56%), which may be due to gel form providing longer contact duration on skin surface (Table 3, Figure 2). Higher skin retention is preferable to permeation for topical effect in wound healing. Therefore, the NE-gel form was more suitable for topical delivery of raloxifene as it exhibited localized epidermal nourishment resulting in the induction of wound healing in particular skin area. Skin irritation test In this study, raloxifene nanoemulsion gel did not show visible signs of skin irritation (erythema and eschar). Additionally, only rubefaction was visible on skin area in some rats only on day 1st and 2nd, which also disappeared before the last day of experiment. The mean irritation score was found to be 0.29 and determined that the non- irritant potential of the raloxifene NE-gel. The results by adding 5 ml of 6 N NaOH. The solution was diluted 10-fold with distilled water and 2 ml from this was mixed 1 ml of chloramine-T solution. Cloramine solution was prepared by mixing these reagents viz., 0.05M chloramines T, H2O 74 % (v/v), 2-propanol 26 % (v/v), 0.629 M NaOH, 0.140 M citric acid, 0.453 M sodium acetate and 0.112 M acetic acid), this solution was incubated at 28 C for 20 min. Onwards this, 1 ml of 0.4M perchloric acid was added to the above solution and again the mixture was further incubated for 5 min at 28 C. Finally, 1ml of Ehrlich s reagent (containing 1 M p-dimethylaminobenzaldehyde and prepared in 30% (v/v) HCl and 70% (v/v) 2-propanol) was added again the mixture was incubated for 20 min at 60 C. Upon cooling, the final mixture was used to measure hydroxyproline content spectrophotometrically (558 nm).47 Standard solution: Hydroxyproline stock solution (100 g/ml in DDW) was serially diluted by diluting 100, 200, 300,400, 500, and 600 l of stock solution with distilled water in separate test tubes. In these tubes, chloramine T solution (1 ml) was added, mixed and incubated for 20 min at 28 C. Onwards this, 1 ml of perchloric acid (0.4M) was added to neutralized excess amount of chloramine T. After 10 min, 1 ml of Ehrlich s reagent was added to each test tube and solution was mixed by shaking the tubes. Finally, added the distilled water to each of the test tubes to make a total volume of 10 ml. The resulting mixture contained 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 g of hydroxyproline respectively. The resulting mixture was measured spectrophotometrically at 558 nm.13,47 Histopathology Rats were anesthetized as per the methods and protocols mentioned above. A circular excision wound was made dorsally in the thoracic region, with the help of a 5 mm biopsy punch.42,43 All the wounded areas of each rat were treated according to protocol using NE-gel (RLX, 0.05 mgkg-1; applied topically twice a day) until the complete healing of the wounds. Cross-sectional skin specimens were collected from each group on day 20 (post-wounding) and fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The collected tissue specimens were cut into thick sections (5 m) for therefore mounted on glass slides using H&E stain (hematoxylin and eosin).48 A light microscope (Olympus CX41) was used to examine the mounted tissues, and epidermal or dermal remodeling was evaluated and graded in terms of re-epithelialization in the epidermis, fibroblast proliferation, granulation formation, neo-vascularization, and collagen synthesis in the dermis.

It clears that wound healing ability more in NOVX equivalent with premenopausal female than OVX equivalent with the postmenopausal female. According to the above test data, we conclude that the higher the breaking strength more is the collagen fiber deposition to the wounded tissue consequently faster the wound healing ability. Percentage of wound contraction The extent of raloxifene s effect on wounded skin in Wistar female (NOVX and OVX) rats was determined by topical application of raloxifene-loaded NE-gel. The area of wound contraction was measured post- wounding (on day 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20) in all the groups, shown in Table 6, Figure 4 (A, B). In untreated NOVX and raloxifene NE-gel treated OVX female rats; the extent of wound contraction was nearly equal from days 4 to 20 of post-wounding, as shown in Figure 4. In excision wound model, the contraction percentage suggest that raloxifene nanoemulsion gel was safe for topical delivery (Table 4). Tensile strength On day 16 of post wounding, the breaking and tensile strength were determined by specific treatment of different groups of rats, Group I untreated (NOVX), Group II untreated(control-OVX) and Group III OVX rats treated with 0.05 mg of raloxifene loaded NE-gel,34 were applied topically throughout the period twice daily. The breaking strength and tensile strength parameters are depicted in Table 5 and Figure 3, where untreated NOVX and raloxifene NE-gel treated OVX groups breaking strength were found to be 783 20 g and 898 25 g respectively, compared to control OVX group 552 15 g. The breaking strength of raloxifene treated OVX rat had significantly higher breaking strength than control-OVX while untreated NOVX rat had slightly less or nearly equal to the raloxifene treated OVX rat. That s proved that raloxifene has wound healing potential in OVX rats. Also, none of the constituents Figure 2: Ex vivo permeation and retention studies of different raloxifene formulations.

Singh, et al.: Wound Healing Potential of Raloxifene Nanoemulsion Gel for the Management of Postmenopausal Cutaneous Wounds Indian Journal of Pharmaceutical Education and Research | Vol 56 | Issue 2 | Apr-Jun, 2022 595 in ovariectomized rats increased in the all groups, but more rapidly in raloxifene-treated group, compared to control (Figure 4). The wound closure rate significantly decreased from days 0 to 4. However, treated groups shown faster closure of wounds as compared to the untreated groups from days 4 to 8. A 100% wound closure was achieved on day 20 of post-wounding in the NOVX and raloxifene-treated OVX rats, whereas only 88% was observed in the control group. This is because the non-ovariectomized rats maintain estrogen content in the skin. This result also demonstrated that except raloxifene, none of the components of nanoemulsion gel have wound healing properties. The nanoemulsion gel with raloxifene applied topically to wounded skin displays significant acceleration of wound contraction. The above result proved that raloxifene had significant properties for wound healing in OVX (postmenopausal) female rats which might be due to contracting the wound area, accelerating wound healing and accelerating re-epithelialization. Hydroxyproline content The hydroxyproline content was assessed in the excisional wound model of OVX female rats at days 4, 12, and 20 of post-wounding, given in Table 7. There was a consistent increase in hydroxyproline concentration from day 4 to 20 of post-wounding if raloxifene was applied topically in the OVX female rat. But, on day 20, the raloxifene-treated OVX rats exhibited a higher content of hydroxyproline of 43.63 g/gram tissue weight, whereas in control on day 20 is 29.90 g/gram tissue weight. Throughout healing, hydroxyproline content was found to be elevated in raloxifene treated group, comparing to the control group. Histopathology The histopathological examination of the excised wound was evaluated and scored of healing processes (fibroblasts proliferation, neo-vascularization, re-epithelialization, collagen deposition) and healing phase (inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling). The results were summarized and compared between the raloxifene treated OVX and the untreated (NOVX and OVX) groups in Table 7. Histopathological examination of normal skin tissue showed epidermis layer and dermis layer with blood vessels, hair follicles, and collagen (Figure 5). In untreated NOVX female rats wound tissues, there were slow regular healing processes indicates re-epithelialization, fibroblast proliferation, collagen fiber synthesis, regeneration of hair follicle, neo-vascularization, formation of the mononuclear cell (Figure 6) as graded in Table 8. In comparison to control- OVX wound, tissues showed persistent inflammation, little proliferation and slow re-epithelialization occur that indicate poor healing is shown in Figure 7, while in Figure 4: Influence of raloxifene in wound contraction effect: (A) Circular wounds of nearly 16 mm in diameter were excised dorsally from the thoracic region of rats.

This is because ovariectomized rats (similar to the menopausal stage) unable to maintain effective estrogen levels. This result also proved that raloxifene has wound healing properties in the estrogen deficient group. Figure 5: Histopathological examination of normal skin tissue.

In vivo studies of the optimized raloxifene nanoemulsion gel formulation also revealed significant increase in various strengths of skin (breaking and tensile strength), a reduction of the wound area, and an increase of the hydroxyproline concentration, which consequently increased the collagen content in OVX rats wound tissue. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether raloxifene applied topically has potential in the management of wound healing in estrogen- deficient OVX female rats. The finding of the present study clearly suggests that ex vivo and in vivo use of nanoemulsion gel of raloxifene significantly influence the collagen deposition, wound contraction and re-epithelization of excised wounds. Histopathological examination also confirms that the raloxifene treated OVX rats have greater accelerated wound healing potential in re-epithelialization, neo-vascularization, fibroblast proliferation, and collagen deposition than the control group. These findings have clear implications for our study, which shows that a topical application of raloxifene hydrochloride nanoemulsion gel has a potential effect in the management of postmenopausal cutaneous wound healing.

SUMMARY With an aim to study the wound healing effects of the raloxifene nanoemulsion gel using topical application the incision and excision wound models in ovariectomized and non-ovariectomized female Wistar rats were used for the management of postmenopausal cutaneous wound healing. Female Wistar rats were used to investigate raloxifene nanoemulsion gel potential for its wound healing effects. The rats were ovariectomized and, after three months of ovariectomy, they were divided into three different groups: untreated-NOVX, controls-OVX, and raloxifene (0.05 mg.kg-1) treated-OVX group. Wound healing effects were characterized in terms of breaking strength, tensile strength, area of wound contraction, wound closure time, hydroxyproline content and histopathological characteristics. The results show that raloxifene exhibits a good wound healing effect in ovariectomized rats. The outcomes of our investigation, give a clear suggestion that raloxifene nanoemulsion gel has wound healing properties in ovariectomized rats and will be effective for postmenopausal cutaneous wound healing.
