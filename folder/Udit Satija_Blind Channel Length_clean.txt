Sabarimalai Manikandan School of Electrical Sciences IIT Bhubaneswar, India {abk10, us11, barathram, msm}@iitbbs.ac.in Abstract Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems are now a part of all major wireless standards, because of its potential to offer high data rate. Cyclic pre x (CP) in OFDM system converts a multipath channel to a at fading channel, thus simpli es the design of equalizer. However, there is a lot of ambiguity in choosing the length of CP. In this paper, we propose a new method for calculation of length of CP using cumulant features. The merits of proposed method are veri ed by computer simulation. Keywords Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), Cyclic pre x (CP), Blind channel length estimation. I. INTRODUCTION Increasing in the number of wireless applications and users demands for reliable, high data rate communication. High data rate can be achieved by effective utilization of the spectrum. Over the past decade, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been seen as a potential solution for utilizing the spectrum effectively. The research efforts in DSA are further fueled by the advent of cognitive radio (CR) [1], due to its potential platform for implementing DSA. High data rates can also be achieved by employing multiple input multiple output (MIMO) and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based systems. CR combined with MIMO and OFDM has the poten- tial to achieve reliability and high data rate. In fact, utilization of CR along with MIMO and OFDM is included in the 4G standards. OFDM provides high data rate by exploiting the orthogo- nality in the frequency domain. One of the key issue in OFDM is to choose the length of cyclic pre x (CP). CP enables OFDM to convert multipath channel to at fading channel and hence simpli es the design of equalizer. In general, the length of CP is decided greater than delay spread of the channel. For practical implementation, generally we consider CP length as one fourth of the OFDM symbol [2]. The way of choosing the xed CP length by this traditional method leads to the wastage of transmission bandwidth. As CP does not carry any extra information, it is required to optimize the length of CP without disturbing the original data. The length of CP should be longer than the length of the channel impulse response (CIR). However, the length of the CIR is not known at the transmitter. Hence, it has to be estimated at the receiver end and then conveyed to the transmitter through some control channel (Refer Fig. 1). Some of the existed work on calculation of channel length and CP length for OFDM system is summarized as follows: In [3], Jong Bu Lim et al. proposed iterative CP reconstruction Control channel Base station Secondary users Fig. 1: Proposed system representation for OFDM transmission procedure based on residual inter symbol interference can- cellation (RISIC). In [4], D. Salvatore et al. introduced bit loading algorithms for an adaptive CP length to enhance the performance of system. In [5], Bin Sheng et al. presented blind algorithm to estimate the channel length based on minimum description length (MDL) for OFDM system. In this paper, we propose a novel method to choose the CP length. The proposed approach is blind, that is no pilot or training sequence is required and hence further saves band- width. The proposed method is well suited for a DSA setup as illustrated in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, the secondary users estimate the ideal CP length, and communicate it to the base station via control channel. The base station then adjusts the CP length for the future transmission. Therefore, by estimating the channel length, CP length can be adjusted. Moreover, the bandwidth can be utilized effectively by avoiding the pilot sequence transmission. In the proposed method, we rst estimate the channel length and then use this information to choose the CP length. For estimating the channel length, we used the algorithm presented in our previous published work [6]. The method is based on cumulant features. Cumulant features have been widely used in the eld of blind signal processing [7] [11]. In this paper, we exploit some unique properties of cumulant features that make it suitable for channel length estimation. The rest of this paper is structured as follows: Section II presents the problem statement. Section III introduces math- ematical background on cumulant features whereas Section IV describes the proposed method. Section V presents the simulation results followed by conclusion in Section VI. II. PROBLEM STATEMENT In this paper, we consider an OFDM system with N subcarriers. The mth OFDM block or symbol is de- noted as Xm = {Xm(0), Xm(1), Xm(2), . . . Xm(N 1)}, where Xm(k) is a complex valued alphabet drawn from a QAM constellation. The inverse discrete Fourier trans- form (IDFT) F 1 of the mth block is denoted as xm = {xm(0), xm(1), xm(2), . . . xm(N 1)}, i.e., xm = F 1  Xm (1) The transmitted symbol is subjected to multi-path fading. The multi-path channel can be modeled as a nite impulse response (FIR) lter h(z 1) = h(0) + h(1)z 1 + . . . + h(M)z M (2) where M is the length of the multipath channel and h(i)( for i = 0, 1 . . . M) is the multi-path gains vector. CP is added before transmitting the time domain block xm. As mentioned earlier, CP is added to avoid intersymbol in- terference (ISI). Let, the length of CP is denoted as P, and hence the total length of the mth block is (N + P). The mth received OFDM block after removing CP is de- noted as ym = {ym(0), ym(1), ym(2), . . . , ym(N 1)}. The corresponding frequency domain block is given by Ym = {Ym(0), Ym(1), Ym(2), . . . Ym(N 1)} where Ym = F { ym} , (3) where F denotes the DFT. The relationship between the transmitted and received symbols of mth block is given by Ym(K) = H(K)Xm(K), K = 0, 1, . . . N 1 (4) where H(K) = H(0), H(1), . . . , H(N 1) is the N point DFT of the channel impulse response in (3). Selection of the length of CP is a challenging problem. The CP length must be greater than the length of the channel impulse response (let M) in order to avoid ISI. However, length of the channel impulse response is not known. In this paper, we propose a novel blind algorithm to estimate the CP length P at the receiver. The block diagram of the proposed method is shown in Fig. 2. In the proposed algorithm, we rst estimate the channel length and then use this information to choose the CP length. The algorithm for estimating the channel length is based on exploiting the properties of nth order cumulant features. III. BACKGROUND THEORY ON CUMULANT FEATURES In this paper, nth order cumulants features are used. For a complex random process v(n), the nth order moment is de ned as [7], [8], [11], [12] Rv(n,m)( ) = E[ n Y j=1 v j( j)] (5) Remove CP OFDM Demodulator Channel order estimation CP length calculation Received data Fig. 2: Block diagram of proposed system at the receiver where n is the order, m is the number of conjugate factors and = [ 1, 2, . . . , n] is the delay vector. The nth order cumulant function is de ned as [7], [8], [11], [12]. Cv(n,m)( ) = X pn F(p) p Y j=1 Rv(nj,mj)( ) (6) where the sum is over distinct partition of indexed set 1, 2, . . . , n and F(p) = ( 1)p 1(p 1)!. The normalized nth order cumulant values are de ned as Cv(n,m)( ) = |Cv(n,m)( )| [C2 v(2,1)(0)] for n = 4, 6 (7) The rationale behind choosing cumulant features, is the fol- lowing two properties of cumulants: Additive property: Let x(k) and y(k) be two independent random processes. If z(k) = x(k) + y(k) then the nth order cumulant value of z(k) is the sum of those of x(k) and y(k). That is, Cz(n,m)( ) = Cx(n,m)( ) + Cy(n,m)( ) (8) Scaling property: Let x = ay. Then the nth order cumulant value of x(k) is |a|n times the cumulant value of y(k). IV. PROPOSED METHOD Before illustrating the proposed approach, we rst study the effect of multipath channel over nth order cumulant values of the received OFDM symbols. The relationship between the transmitted and received symbols of the mth block is given by Ym(K) = H(K)Xm(K) for k = 0, 1, . . . , N 1 where H(K) = M 1 X i=0 h(i)e (i2 k) N (9) Using the scaling property of the cumulant features, it can be easily shown that CYm(K)(n,m)( , M) = (M) CXm(K)(n,m) (10) where CYm(K)(n,m) is the normalized cumulant value of kth OFDM symbol in mth block and (M) = M 1 P K=0 |H(K)|n ( M 1 P K=0 |H(K)|2)n/2 (11) where M is the order or length of channel. By observing (9) and (11), and by using the fact that |e (i2 k) N | = 1, it can be easily shown that (M) < 1. Hence, it is clear that the length of channel is inversely proportional to the magnitude of cumulant values of the received OFDM symbols. The magnitude of the cumulant values of the received OFDM symbols shrinks by increasing the length of channel. Also, the magnitude of shrinkage depends on the value of M, i.e., (M) < (M ) for M > M (12) and hence CYm(K)(n,m)( , M) < CYm(K)(n,m)( , M ) for M > M (13) The pseudocode of the proposed algorithm is shown as below: Algorithm 1 Pseudocode of the proposed algorithm 1: Input: Received data Ym(K) with N subcarriers 2: Estimate the received cumulant CYm(K) values of the received data using the method in [7], [8], [11], [12] 3: for i=1,2, . . .M do 4: if CYm(K)(i+1)+ CYm(K)(i) 2 < CYm(K) 5: < CYm(K)(i 1)+ CYm(K)(i) 2 then 6: if M=M then 7: Terminate loop 8: endif 9: else 10: i=i+1; 11: endif 12: endfor 13: EndProcedure The estimated channel length M , is used to calculate the ideal CP length. Typically, CP length P is chosen such that P M. In this work, we choose CP length P to be P = k M (14) where k is an integer greater than two. The value of P is chosen in such a way that it is at least double of the estimated channel length. V. SIMULATION RESULTS MATLAB simulations are performed to test the proposed algorithm and the results are summarized. In this case, proba- bility of correctness (Pc) is taken as performance metric and can be de ned as Pc= prob(detection says M is true | M is M ). In other words, Pc = P(M /M ) is the probability that the channel length is estimated as M , given the channel length is M . Cumulant values are calculated at the output of the OFDM demodulator. For the simulations, 4th and 6th order cumulants |CYm(4,0)| and |CYm(6,0)| features are considered, as they are robust to phase rotation. The following experiments are performed with BPSK constellation. Experiment-1: In this experiment, we considered fourth order cumulant features. Channel order considered as 1,2. That is the proposed algorithm has to estimate whether the tap of the channel is 1 or 2. Here, we have used N = 1024 bits per OFDM symbol to estimate the cumulants. The results are summarized in Fig. 3. In Fig. 3, M = 1 denotes the probability of correctly estimating the 1 tap channel and M = 2 for 2 tap channel. From Fig. 3, it can be observed that the probability of correctly estimating the channel (Pc) is more than 75% even at negative SNR (in dB scale). -5 0 5 10 15 20 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 SNR vs Prob.of.correctness (PC) SNR in dB prob.of correctness PC M=1 M=2 Fig. 3: SNR vs Pc with N = 1024 Experiment-2: This experiment is similar to previous one, except that four possible conditions are considered. That is the algorithm need to identify whether the channel is a 1 tap, 2 taps, 3 taps or 4 taps. The results are summarized in Fig. 4. In Fig. 4, M = i (for i = 1, 2, 3, 4), has the same meaning as previous experiment. It can be seen that the algorithm performs well in estimating 1, 2 and 3 tap channel. However, in the case of 4 tap channel the performance of the method is poor. This is because, the shrinkage in the cumulant values is high and more number of bits or samples are required to estimate it. We repeat the experiment with more number of samples (N = 4096) and the results are summarized in Fig. 5. From the Fig. 5, it can be seen that the performance of estimating 4 tap channel is improved (70% at 0 dB) when N is increased. Experiment-3: In this experiment, we consider the same case as experiment 1, here we considered sixth order cumulants instead of fourth order and channel length is indicated with L. From Fig. 6, it can be seen that the robustness of correct detection. The reason is sixth order cumulants are more robust than fourth order cumulants.

In the proposed method, once the channel length is estimated the CP length is chosen to be twice the channel length. This results in a signi cant reduction in bandwidth as illustrated in Table I. Here, we consider N = 1024 subcarriers per OFDM symbol. In the traditional method, CP length is chosen as one fourth of the OFDM symbol length, i.e., 256 bits per OFDM symbol. However, in our proposed method CP length is chosen according to channel length. VI. CONCLUSION In this paper, a new method is introduced for calculating the ideal CP length in OFDM system. The signi cant reduction in CP length leads to bandwidth ef cient OFDM system. As a part of work a novel algorithm for estimating the channel length has been proposed. The proposed algorithm is blind and does not require any training sequence to estimate channel length. Using simulation results, it was shown that the proposed algorithm outperforms other algorithms even at low SNR.
