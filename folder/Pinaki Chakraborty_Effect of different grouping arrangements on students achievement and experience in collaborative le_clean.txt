A collaborative learning environment has been used as a pedagogical tool for a long time now. However, there is no clarity on which grouping strategy to use. In this paper, we study the impact of grouping on students performances. We aim to examine how di erent grouping arrangements, leading to di erent learning environments, a ect students academic achievement. Also, in most cases homogeneity or heterogeneity is decided on the basis of students ability. For group learning, students were grouped into two di erent settings on the basis of their learning perspectives derived from class notes and their personality types. In the present study, we used a novel algorithm based on k modes clustering. Grouping indeed improved students performance, particularly, the heterogeneous groups performed better than the homogenous groups. Students experience with learning in the two di erent environments indicates that they were more satis ed with homogeneous group settings. ARTICLE HISTORY Received 28 September 2021 Accepted 24 January 2022 KEYWORDS Collaborative learning environments; homogeneous grouping; heterogeneous grouping 1. Introduction Teaching-learning strategies widely acknowledge collaborative learning environments for the posi- tive learning outcomes they lead to (Gillies, 2006; Johnson & Johnson, 2002). A collaborative learning environment is a setting in which individuals acquire and share knowledge through experience with one another (Argote et al., 2001). In other words, a group of students learn together and take advan- tage of each other s expertise and experiences to achieve a common goal. Learning in groups improves performance levels (Gregory & Thorley, 2013; Johnson & Johnson, 2009), enhances student achievement (Donovan et al., 2018) and makes the transfer of knowledge easy among the participants (Pfa & Huddelston, 2003). Students who learn in groups also develop better social interaction skills (Johnson & Johnson, 1990). Apart from the academic and social bene ts, col- laborative learning (CL) bene ts students psychologically (Laal & Ghodsi, 2012). However, despite being a widely practiced teaching strategy, there is ambiguity on grouping methods in collaborative learning environments. Homogenous and heterogeneous grouping are the two major ways to group students in CL. In homogeneous grouping, students of similar charac- teristics learn together. Contrary to this, students of diverse characteristics and abilities learn together in heterogeneous grouping (Baer, 2003). The question of grouping who with whom is 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group CONTACT Kanika kanikatehlan@gmail.com INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS https://doi.org/10.1080/10494820.2022.2036764 still unanswered (Saleh et al., 2005; Zamani, 2016) because of the con icting evidence (Donovan et al., 2018). Several studies claim that homogenous grouping yields better learning outcomes (Baer, 2003; Kemper Patrick, 2020; Schullery & Schullery, 2006). On the other hand, some experiments suggest assigning students into heterogeneous groups enhances student learning and interdepen- dence (Wilkinson et al., 2010). Studies with no overall di erence between the impact of the two grouping strategies also exist (Hooper & Hanna n, 1988; Zamani, 2016). These variations may result from the basis of deciding homogeneity or heterogeneity. In this paper, we study the e ect of grouping on learning outcomes and the di erence the two grouping strategies have on students achievement and experiences. Groups are formed on the basis of learning perspectives and personality types of students in a class. To extract the unique learning perspectives, we use students class notes and teacher s notes. The infor- mation extracted from class notes can be mapped to di erent learning perspectives. Addition- ally, claims of high chances of con icts in heterogeneous grouping (Schullery & Schullery, 2006) inspire us also to consider personality types while grouping students. The di erence in scores in post- and pre-test is taken as a measure of impact. Students experiences with di erent learning environments are analyzed with a survey. The following are the contributions of the paper: . We propose a novel grouping algorithm based on k modes clustering to group students homo- geneously and heterogeneously. . To group students, we consider the learning perspective of every student in the class. . To minimize con icts, we also take consider the personality type of every student. . We study the e ect of grouping by comparing the learning performances of students learning without any grouping with the one s learning in groups. . Students achievement and learning experiences are compared in homogenous and hetero- geneous learning environments. 1.1. Research questions The study speci cally evaluates the impact of grouping methods in CL on undergraduate students. To examine how grouping methods relate to academic achievement, the following hypotheses are tested: H01: There is no statistically signi cant di erence in the academic achievement of students learning in colla- borative learning environments. H11: There is a statistically signi cant di erence in the academic performance of students learning in collabora- tive learning environments. H02: There is no signi cant di erence in students academic performance of homogenous and heterogeneous groups in collaborative learning environments. H12: There is a di erence in students academic performance of homogenous and heterogeneous groups in col- laborative learning environments. Here, the learning environment in which the students learn is an independent variable. In other words, the grouping method is an independent variable, and academic achievement is a dependent variable. In addition to this, examining how was the collaborative environments provided on the basis of learning perspectives raised the following research question: RQ1: How was students learning experience in the two collaborative environments? The paper is organized into four more sections. The next section of the paper elaborates on work on grouping strategies in the past. Section 3 gives details of the materials and methods used in 2 KANIKA ET AL. performing the experiment. The results of the study are explained in section 4. In the end, the authors list some essential conclusions. 2. Related work 2.1. Homogeneous vs. heterogeneous grouping Despite several pieces of evidence indicating the usefulness of collaborative learning environments, there is a lack of agreement among researchers as to which groping method is better. One of the largest studies compared the two methods of grouping over three consecutive semesters. Students were grouped homogeneously and heterogeneously on the basis of prior achievements. Here, a sig- ni cant di erence was observed in the performance of nal exams, with homogeneously grouped students performing better (Baer, 2003). Schullery and Schullery (2006) also studied the variations in outcomes of two groups composed di erently on the basis of personality. The experiment was performed on 394 undergraduate students who were asked to complete a project collaboratively. At the end of the project, it was noted that both the grouping strategies had positive impacts on certain sets of skills. However, students from homogenous groups achieved more academically. Ability-based grouping methods also claim the superiority of homogenous grouping over hetero- geneous when performed on school students (Adodo & Agbayewa, 2011). Similar outcomes were observed on subjects like chemistry when students were grouped on the basis of gender (Adesoji et al., 2015). Contrary to this, the heterogeneous grouping strategy also proves to be more bene cial in certain scenarios. For instance, the e ect of the two methods of grouping was analyzed on students dis- course and comprehension. Here also, the students were grouped on the basis of ability. The authors found heterogeneous grouping much more bene cial than homogenous grouping (Murphy et al., 2017). However, it was a small experiment involving only a group discussion. With the increasing acceptability of e learning, the idea of collaborative environments was also applied in online scenarios. Sanz-Mart nez et al. (2019) claim that CL improves the e ectiveness of MOOCs. The authors grouped students on the basis of engagement levels. Rather than grouping with the two contrary strategies, they grouped all the students according to varying degrees of hom- ogeneity. Task completion, satisfaction, peer interaction and overall experiences were better in groups with a higher degree of homogeneity. In a similar attempt, Wichmann et al. (2016, august) found heterogeneous groups slightly more productive than homogeneous groups in a massive online learning course. 2.2. Basis of deciding homogeneity and heterogeneity The variation in outcomes is an indication that several other factors play a crucial role in determining the success or failure of grouping methods. The most common parameter for grouping used in the past is students ability (Adodo & Agbayewa, 2011; Miller et al., 2012; Saleh et al., 2005). Studies have also considered race, culture (Shen, 2003), students choice (Donovan et al., 2018) and gender (Adesoji et al., 2015) while forming di erent groups. For e-learning systems, students engagement levels are considered for grouping (Sanz-Mart nez et al., 2019). In an educational context, students can also be described by their unique cognitive style (Jovanovic et al., 2012). Cognitive abilities are a crucial determinant of note taking and memory for lecture content (Jansen et al., 2017). Taking notes in a class while the teacher is teaching is indeed cognitively e ortful (Piolat et al., 2005). Apart from cognitive abilities making a di erence, identifying the important and unimportant information also depends greatly on the student s perspective (Peverly et al., 2014). Hence, class notes represent a student s learning perspective that is unique due to cognitive di erences and other such reasons. INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 3 In this paper, we aim to evaluate the learning perspectives of students on the basis of class notes taken while the teacher is teaching in class. Homogenous and heterogeneous groups are formed on the basis of learning perspectives. In addition to learning perspectives derived from class notes, per- sonality types also determine people s compatibility in a group (Schullery & Schullery, 2006; Staple- ton, 2007). Personality type in a group in uences the learning outcomes and group cohesion (Tett & Murphy, 2002). For personality type-based grouping, MBTI is a commonly used tool for assigning a personality type to each student (Schullery & Schullery, 2006; Stapleton, 2007). Considering this, we also use MBTI to extract various personality traits of students. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Participants One hundred ninety-four undergraduate students from the seventh semester of the computer engineering department at an engineering college participated in the study. The experiment was carried out in the spring semester of 2020 2021. Group learning was facilitated in the class of Agile software development. Following the accepted ethical practice, the participants were assured that their identities would be kept anonymous. 3.2. Design The study follows a quasi-experimental design since it involved a pre-test at the beginning of the session followed by treatment and a post-test at the end. The same teacher taught all the students and evaluated the papers of pre-test and post-test. Students achievement measured by test scores was the dependent variable of the present study. The type of grouping and personality of students were the two independent variables. Overall, three groups were participating in the study, with one control group and two experimental groups. The control group learned individually without any grouping. The heterogeneous experimental group consisted of students with di erent learning per- spectives and di erent personality types, and homogenous groups comprised students with similar learning perspectives. 3.3. Procedure In all three groups, at the beginning of the semester, the teacher taught in a traditional setting without any collaboration. After two weeks of traditional teaching, the teacher took a pre-assess- ment test to evaluate the performance of each student. The test consisted of four open-ended ques- tions on the introduction and basics of agile software development. Each question carries 5 points, making the pre-assessment test of 20 points. While the control group continued to learn tradition- ally, the students from the two experimental groups had to give some tests. The students passed a personality assessment test that assigned them to an appropriate MBTI personality type. MBTI clas- si es people into 16 di erent personality types based on their lifestyle, attitude towards life, method of perception and judging. Every personality is a combination of four-letter from: E/I; S/N; T/F and J/P where, E extravert, I introvert, S sensing, N intuition, T thinking, F feeling, J judgment and P perception (Smith, 1989). Students from the experimental groups were also asked to submit their class notes of their rst lecture on Scrum and Adaptive Software development . The students were made familiar with the aim of the course and the bene ts of CL. They were also made aware of their partners for the entire course duration. However, the basis of grouping was not disclosed. Each class in the semester was followed by discussions on the topics taught in class. During the discussion, the teacher walked into the class and among the pairs to observe the participation of the learners. At the end of the course, the teacher took a post-test of 20 marks involving all the students from experimental and control 4 KANIKA ET AL. group. Similar to pre-test, it also had 4 open-ended questions of 5 marks each. This evaluated each student s performance individually. A survey was also conducted to judge the di erences in experi- ences with the two learning environments. The research ow is depicted in Figure 1. 3.4. Instruments We used two major instruments in the present study: academic achievement and class notes. First, the teacher took a pre-test to analyze the current abilities of students. The purpose of the pre-test was to measure the change in academic achievement before and after the treatment in the exper- imental group. Having administered the pre-test, the participants were asked to submit the class notes to the teacher for further processing. The class notes are used to homogenize and heteroge- nize the students on the basis of learning perspectives. Experience with the collaborative learning environments based on the learning perspectives was estimated with a survey. Figure 1. Flowchart depicting research ow. INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 5 3.4.1. Academic achievement The control group took classes and completed assignments individually with no grouping. Both the experimental groups were given the assignment to complete collaboratively. The participants were assessed for independent knowledge gains. A pre-test and a post-test were used to evaluate stu- dents independent knowledge gains in all three groups. A score was given out of 20 points to each individual and groups. 3.4.2. Experience of collaborative learning environment Students experience with the CL provided through di erent types of grouping in the experimental groups was assessed by measuring their satisfaction. Satisfaction was evaluated using the following questions given by Peeters et al. (2006): i If I ever have to participate in a similar project, I would like to do it with this group. ii Overall, I was satis ed with the composition of our group. iii In general, the proceedings of the group were done in a pleasant atmosphere. These questions assess satisfaction as a measure of the perceived e ectiveness of grouping. For every question the participants had to rate their agreement on a 5-point Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). 3.5. Grouping Class notes of each student are given as input to an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system. The data are rst pre-processed, corrected for spelling errors and the part-of-speech tagging is applied. The system then selects all nouns and nouns followed by adjectives as keywords. The keywords are converted into concepts using the index of an e-book corresponding to the subject (First author et al., 2019). Let TC= {concepts extracted from teacher s notes}. 3.5.1. Clustering students with similar learning perspectives To cluster students with similar learning perspectives together, we use the K-Modes algorithm. The K-Modes algorithm gives considerably good results when applied to real-world categorical data. This algorithm replaces the means of clusters with modes and minimizes the cost function using a fre- quency-based method (Huang, 1998). The algorithm takes as input a matrix M representing the dis- tribution of concepts among students with respect to the concepts the teacher taught in class. For this, we compare concepts extracted from notes of every student with that of teacher s notes. The following is the conversion of data into matrix M: M: = (ai,j)m*n, for all 1 i m and 1 j n, where m is the total number of students and n is the keywords present. ai,j = 0 if a concept from TC is not present in the student s notes. ai,j = 1 if a concept from TC is present in the student s notes. The K-Modes algorithm treats every row in M as the feature vector for a particular student. While clustering using the K-Modes algorithm, we also specify the optimum number of clusters. The aim is to choose the number of clusters so that adding a new cluster doesn t create much di erence. To get this number, we use the elbow method and Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS). WCSS is an indi- cator of the closeness of each point in the cluster with the center of the cluster (Hartigan & Wong, 1979). 6 KANIKA ET AL. 3.5.2. Homogeneous grouping Once we have clustered students according to their learning perspectives, now the clusters can be further divided into smaller groups. Group size is the minimum or maximum number of learners who learn collaboratively. Although the clusters already have students with a similar perspective, studies are indicating the preference of students to smaller group sizes (Kooloos et al., 2011). Also, small- sized groups are better from the viewpoint of productivity (Putnam, 1978), performance and social interactions (Saqr et al., 2019, september). Hence, the system divides the clusters into smaller sizes of 3 5. Rather than randomly picking up students and grouping together, the system consider the personality type of each student. Several studies state the bene ts of diverse personalities in a group (Clinebell & Stecher, 2003; Sfetsos et al., 2006, june). Following a similar line of thought, we group students of a cluster with di erent personality characteristics. The stepwise details are given in the algorithm depicted in Figure 2. 3.5.3. Heterogeneous grouping Since hamming distance in the matrix M represents the dissimilarities between rows/students con- cepts, we use this as a base to group students heterogeneously. If a row di ers from another row, the two students representing the rows are considered to have di erent learning perspectives. Hence they can be grouped provided they have di erent personality types. So, in a heterogeneous group- ing, we group students of varying personality types and di erent learning perspectives. The detailed procedure for heterogeneous grouping is given in Figure 3. 4. Results In the beginning, we randomly initialize the k modes algorithm. Using these random values, the cal- culated WCSS is plotted against corresponding k values (Hartigan & Wong, 1979). The elbow of the curve is highlighted in Figure 4. Following the method, 9 comes out to be an optimum number of clusters. Figure 2. Algorithm for homogenous grouping. INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 7 Figure 5 depicts the number of students in each cluster. After clustering and grouping using algorithms for heterogeneous and homogenous grouping discussed in Section 3, the stu- dents attended classes in groups. At the end of the course, they were assessed for academic achievement. 4.1. Academic achievement The mean scores of pre-test and post-test for the control group are 15.23 and 15.27, respectively. The mean scores of the same for the homogenous group are 15.14 and 15.30. As given in Table 1, the mean scores of the two tests for heterogeneously grouped students were 15.77.and 16.51. The vari- ations in mean scores of students from homogeneous and heterogeneous groups are depicted in Figure 6. The graph shows that students in heterogeneous and homogeneous groups at the post- test improved. The achievement gain for the students of the control group was 0.04, for the homo- geneous group, it was 0.16 and it was 0.74 for heterogeneously grouped students. Figure 3.

For testing the rst hypothesis, H01 stating that there is no di erence in the academic achieve- ment of students learning in collaborative learning environments, we apply paired t-test on the scores of pre-test and post-test of the control group and experimental groups. The di erence in the mean scores of post-test and pre-test is 0.53 for experimental groups. On the other hand, the di erence of mean scores in the case of the control group is 0.04. The results of t-test on pre-test and post-test scores of students indicate an improvement on the post-test with a mean di erence signi cant at t (127) = 4.06, p < .001. The analysis of pre-test and post-test di erence of the control group leads to no signi cant improvement with t (66) = 0.19, p < .001. In addition to this, we also tested the post-test scores of the control group, heterogeneous group and homogeneous group for any signi cant di erence using ANOVA. The results at p < .05 and f ratio 12.46 indicate a signi cant di erence in the performance of the three groups with p < .001. A pair- wise comparison suggests that the mean scores of students of the control group and the students of the experimental group with homogeneous grouping did not di er signi cantly. However, on com- paring the scores of students from the experimental group with heterogeneous grouping with the other two groups, a signi cant di erence was recorded. The statistical details are given in Table 1. Table 2 depicts the test results. So, on the basis of this, the null hypothesis H01 is rejected. And according to the acceptance of H11, we can conclude that collaborative learning environments indeed improve the learning environments. However, it is still not clear which grouping strategy is better. To test the null hypothesis H02 of the research claiming that there is no signi cant di erence in academic performance of students of homogenous and heterogeneous groups in collaborative learning environments, we check for statistically signi cant di erences between the gains of the two groups. The descriptive statistics is given in Table 3. By looking at the descriptive statistics, we can say there is a clear improvement in the perform- ance of students of heterogeneous groups, and the mean score of homogeneously grouped stu- dents also improved slightly. However, to nd out whether the di erences between the means were statistically signi cant or not, paired t-tests were applied. The results of t (61) = 1.89, p < .01 indicate no signi cant di erence in the mean scores of the homogeneous group on the pre-test and post-test. Figure 5.

Variables Control group Homogeneous group Heterogeneous group Number of students 66 62 66 X 1008 959 1090 Mean 15.27 15.46 16.51 Std. deviation 1.55 1.74 1.27 INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS 9 The results on heterogeneously grouped students show an improvement on the post-test with a mean di erence signi cant at t (65) = 3.72, p < .01. It is concluded that students from the het- erogeneous groups improved in the post-test. Therefore, the null hypothesis H02, which said there is no signi cant di erence between students academic achievement working in hom- ogenous and heterogeneous groups, is rejected. The scores of heterogeneous groups improved signi cantly. On the other hand, no signi cant improvement was seen in the scores of hom- ogenous groups. Hence, hypothesis H12, stating that the two grouping methods create a di erence in students academic achievements, is accepted with heterogeneous groups performing better. A summary of paired t-tests for learners in di erent collaborative environments is given in Table 4. 4.2. The di erence in experiences with the two learning environments The control group received no treatment; hence, we compare the experiences of the two experimen- tal groups. A survey was conducted to assess the experiences of students learning in di erent col- laborative environments. The same questions were asked to all the students, and they had responses to choose from ranging from 5 to 1. The rst question assesses the compatibility of grouping using learning perspectives and personality types. With the mode and median and mode at 4, hom- ogenous and heterogeneous groups varied slightly in the mean values. The mean of responses of heterogeneously grouped students was 3.57, while that of homogenous grouping was 3.83. Simi- larly, on summarizing the responses to question measuring satisfaction, the mean of heteroge- neously grouped students was 3.8, and the mean for homogeneously grouped students responses was 4.04. Even in the third question of the survey analyzing the learning atmosphere, the mean of responses from the homogenous group was 3.95, while for the heterogeneous group it was 3.8. Although the responses from both types of learning environments were quite posi- tive, comparatively, we can say that students from homogeneous groups had better learning experi- ences than heterogeneous groups.

Conclusion In the present study, we tried to see the impact of collaboration on students achievements. We also aimed at seeking the superiority of one collaborative learning environment over the other. For this purpose, we used the learning perspectives of students and their personality types as the basis for group formation. The teacher also conducted a pre-test and post-test to track the improvement. The experiences with the learning environments were assessed with a survey comprising three simple questions. On the basis of the scores of pre-test and post-test, it was clear that collaboration in u- ences the academic achievement of students positively. We compared the scores of the students studying in two di erent collaborative environments for signi cant di erences. It was observed that heterogeneously grouped students performed better than homogeneously grouped students. So, it can be concluded that although collaboration improves the academic achievement of students, heterogeneous grouping is found to have a greater in uence on students performance. The authors also analyzed whether the idea of grouping students on the basis of learn- ing perspectives and personality types leads to compatible groups or not. For this, students responses to questions assessing the satisfaction and perception for the learning environment were considered. The results indicated that the blend of learning perspectives and personality types lead to favorable group compositions. However, in this case, the responses from students who learned in homogenous groups had a better learning experience and satisfaction than the het- erogeneously grouped students. The study nds a collaborative environment with heterogeneous grouping superior over an environment comprising homogenous students in terms of academic achievement. Contrary to this, in terms of learning experience, homogenous learning environment was better. Hence, it can be concluded that the superiority of the type of collaborative learning environment depends on the results you want. However, in the future we would work on the optimization of group composition in such a way that the students have a better learning experience and at the same time improve their skills. This may be a blend of the two grouping techniques or a foolproof grouping strategy consider- ing various factors such as gender, attitude and skill levels apart from learning perspectives.
