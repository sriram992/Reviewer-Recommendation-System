Children now get access to smartphones at an early age and gradually acquire skills to use di erent types of smartphone apps. We developed a mathematical model for the ability and interest of children to use smartphone apps. The model can be used to determine the level of di culty of apps and identify niche app, i.e. apps that are designed speci cally to be used by a narrow age range of children. We used the model to analyze nine apps that are used by children. We found three of the apps to be of suitable di culty level, four of them to be too easy and two of them to be too di cult for children who are interested in using them. We were also able to identify three niche apps. 1. Introduction A smartphone is a mobile phone that has computational power comparable to that of a personal computer. A smart- phone has an internal organization and an operating system similar to those of a computer. The operating system of a smartphone facilitates the execution of user programs, collo- quially known as apps. A smartphone has one or more cam- eras, a microphone, a speaker and support for multimedia. A smartphone can be used to connect to the Internet and also has sensors like an accelerometer and a GPS receiver that enhances its utility and mobility [1]. However, best recog- nized feature of a smartphone is its touchscreen. The touchscreen spans almost the entire front side of a smart- phone and acts as both an input device and an output device. A ordable smartphones became available in the early- 2000s and the number of people using smartphones has been steadily increasing ever since [2]. Today, smartphones are used around the world by people of di erent ages and professions. Low Internet tari and the availability of apps for various purposes encourage people to use smartphones. People use smartphones for communication, educational purposes, professional commitments and leisure. Smartphones are known for their narrow gulf of execu- tion, i.e. the gap between what has to be done and how it can be done. This allows non-expert casual users to use smartphones almost like tech-savvy professional users [3]. Many casual users are intimidated by the input devices of a computer like keyboard and mouse. The touchscreen of a smartphone displays icons and simple menus that a user can manipulate intuitively. Additionally, smartphone apps typically display less information at a time and use only sim- ple widgets which further help casual users. There are people who are not comfortable in using computers but can use smartphones with ease. Nowadays, innumerable smartphone apps are used by people to assist them in their daily activities. Smartphone apps to pay bills, forecast weather, track tness, shop for gro- cery items and teach cooking are a few examples of the wide variety of apps that are used by people. Social media apps and video chat apps are highly popular in societies with diverse socio-economic background to share their day to day status and maintain close interaction with relatives liv- ing in far o places. In addition, smartphone apps for enter- tainment, teaching and learning are popular among leisure driven users, knowledge seekers and information providers, Hindawi Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies Volume 2022, Article ID 3493218, 7 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/3493218 respectively. Smartphone apps like game apps, roleplay based apps, storybook apps, drawing apps, encyclopaedic apps and collaborative learning apps have been found to be liked by children while growing up. Parents and teachers often download popular educational apps to teach novel words, and concepts of science and mathematics, and encourage children to augment their learning through the well conceptualised content of these smartphone apps. Even though children are exposed a lot to science and mathemat- ics content through smartphone apps nowadays, our under- standing of how much children can learn from their interaction with mobile devices and how children achieve the same is in the nascent stage. 1.1. Child-Smartphone Interaction. Yan [4] has recently remarked that how children s understanding of emerging technologies originates is an important question from the perspectives of human evolution as well as development of technology. Children are exposed to digital devices at an early age [5]. Young children typically interact more fre- quently with smartphones than other digital devices [6]. Par- ents often play music and videos on their smartphones to pacify crying children or entertain them when they are just few months old. Children are attracted to smartphones because of their small size and stylish design and the func- tionalities they provide. Children can hold a smartphone rmly in their hands by the age of two years [7]. Children gradually acquire various skills required to operate smart- phones. They learn to acquire targets on the screen, perform various touchscreen gestures [8 10], follow instructions pro- vided by apps [10, 11], navigate hypertext [12] and use aug- mented reality software [13] by eleven years of age. A skill, once acquired, is retained by children. Children constitute the largest class of non-expert users of smartphones. Di erent types of apps are used by children while growing up. Children younger than two years are pas- sive users of smartphones. They can listen to music and watch videos played on smartphones and even knowingly participate in video calls made using smartphones but do not try to operate smartphones. At around two years of age, children begin to make e orts to operate smartphones. Children aged two and three years can use drawing apps and simple games. Children aged four to six years can use vocabulary apps, quiz apps and other educational apps. Chil- dren aged seven and eight years can use encyclopaedia apps and educational games. Children aged nine years and more can use web browsers and instant messaging apps. Children are interested in using an app for a few years, however, with increase in age the app fall out of their interest and they become fascinated by more sophisticated apps. Children typically regard smartphones as tools to support their aca- demic and co-curricular endeavors, while many parents and teachers are not supportive of the use of smartphones by children [14]. Smartphone apps meant for entertainment and learning of children can be e ective only if children are inclined to use those apps and the children also possess the skills required to use those app. Children in di erent age groups have signi cant di erence in their physical and cognitive abilities [15]. Studies investigating the relationship between abilities and interests of children to use smartphone apps are largely missing from the literature. Consequently, smart- phone apps for children are often found to be designed with- out due consideration of the abilities and interests of the target age group of children. Although child-smartphone interaction has been an active eld of research for more than a decade now, no mathematical model of abilities and interests of children to use smartphone apps has been developed yet. In this paper, we develop a mathematical model of applicability and suit- ability of smartphone apps for children based on the results of empirical studies conducted before. 2. The Model Researchers have been studying the interaction of children with the smartphone apps for the last two decades. We have been working on this topic for the past ve years and have studied how children of di erent age groups interact with di erent types of apps. In our previous studies, we were able to identify the most important skills needed by children to use smartphone apps. We have also observed how the inter- est of children about various apps changes with age. In the present study, we used the results of our previous empirical studies to construct a mathematical model of child- smartphone interaction. The model is based on probability theory and studies the relationship between the proportion of children who are able to use an app and the proportion of children who are interested in using the app at di erent ages. 2.1. Ability of Children. We use a parabola to model how children acquire a certain skill (Figure 1). Let x1 be the age at which some children acquire the skill and x2 be the age by which all children acquire the skill. The values of x1 and x2 may be determined empirically. Since the vertex of the parabola is at (x1,0), the proportion of children who have acquired the skill at the age x is as follows. y = 4a x x1 p 1 Since all children acquire the skill by x2, the value of a can be calculated as follows. a = 1 4 x2 x1 2 2.2. Interest of Children. We use a Gaussian function with unit height to model the interest of children about an app (Figure 1). Let x3 be the age at which 10% children are inter- ested in using the app and x4 be the age at which all children are interested in using the app. The proportion of children who are interested in the app at the age x is as follows. y = e x x4 2/2c2 3 2 Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies Since the curve passes through (x3, 0.1), 0:1 = e x3 x4 2/2c2 4 Now, the value of c can be calculated as follows. c = x3 x4 2 2 ln 10 r 5 The parameter c represents the applicability of an app, i.e. the size of its target audience. If c 1 for an app, then we call it a niche app. 2.3. Relationship between Ability and Interest. We use a parabola to represent the most important skill required to use an app. Let the parabola (vide Equation (1)) and the Gaussian function (vide Equation (3)) for that app intersect at two points, viz. P (xp, yp) and Q (xq, yq). Since the equa- tions of the parabola and the Gaussian function cannot be solved algebraically, computer simulation may be used to determine the values of xp and xq. Let A1 be the area below the Gaussian function between xp and xq. Since an inde nite integral of a Gaussian function does not exist, we use an approximation as follows. A1 = xq xp e x x4 2/2c2dx e x x4 2/2c2dx = c 2 p 6 Let A2 be the area below the parabola between xp and xq. A2 = xq xp 4a x x1 p dx = 4 a p 3 xq x1  3/2 xp x1  3/2 h i 7 Let A be the area enclosed by the Gaussian function and the parabola between xp and xq. A = A1 A2 = c 2 p 4 a p 3 xq x1  3/2 xp x1  3/2 h i 8 The parameter A represents the level of di culty of an app. If A=0, then we say that the app is too easy for children. If 0<A 3.5, then we say that the app is suitable for children. If A>3.5, then we say that the app is too di cult for children. 3. Validation of the Model 3.1. Parameter a. We identi ed the important skills required by children to operate smartphones from the literature and calculated the value of the parameter a for these skills using Equation (2) (Table 1). Children need to hold a smartphone rmly in their hands in order to operate it. Some children are able to hold a smartphone properly in their hands at around eighteen months of age while the remaining children can do so by two years of age [7]. The value of the parameter a was found to be 0.5 for the skill of holding a smartphone rmly. Children learn to acquire stationary and moving tar- gets on the screen of a smartphone between two and four years of age [16] and the value of the parameter a was found to be 0.125. Children learn to perform single- nger touchsc- reen gestures between two and ve years of age [8, 17] and two- nger touchscreen gestures between seven and ten years of age [10]. The value of the parameter a was found to be 0.083 for both the skills. Children are able to follow non- textual and textual information provided by apps by seven and nine years of age, respectively [10]. The value of the parameter a was 0.083 and 0.125 for the two skills, respec- tively. Some children can use complex menu systems and navigate hypertext by nine years of age while the others can do so by eleven. The value of the parameter a was 0.125 for both the skills. Children become able to use aug- mented reality software between seven and ten years of age [13] and the value of the parameter a for the skill was 0.083. We found that the di erence between the age at which some children acquire a skill and the age at which all chil- dren acquire it was typically two to three years, i.e. 0.075< a<0.125 for most of the skills. Figure 2 shows the parabolic curves for the di erent skills. 3.2. Parameters c and A. We identi ed some smartphone apps that are used by children (Table 2). We calculated the values of the parameters c and A for these apps using Equa- tion (5) and Equation (8), respectively, and thus determined their applicability and suitability (Table 3). For example, Baby s Fish is a simple game that requires acquiring on- screen targets and found interesting by children aged two to six years. The value of the parameter c was found to be 0.932 and the value of the parameter A was found to be 1.869 for this app. These values indicate that it is a niche app and suitable for two to six year old children. Baby s But- ter ies app is similar to Baby s Fish except for the fact that the former uses augmented reality [13]. The app is not a niche app and too di cult for many children aged two to ten years who are interested in using it. We studied the applicability and suitability of two drawing apps, viz. Baby s Drawing and Sketch Draw and Paint. The value of the parameter c was found to be 0.932 and 2.796 for the two apps, respectively, and the value of the parameter A was found to be 1.286 and 6.448 of the two apps, respectively. These results imply that Baby s Drawing is a niche app of suitable level of di culty while Sketch Draw and Paint is Age x2 x3 x1 Proportion 1 0 0.1 x4 P(xp, yp) Q(xq, yq) A Ability Interest Figure 1: Ability and interest of children to use a smartphone app. 3 Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies too di cult for children who are interested in using it. Kid English Vocabulary is used by children aged four to eight years to learn novel words and their spelling and pronunci- ation. We found the app to be a niche app and easy for the children in the speci ed age range. Similarly, children nd YouTube Kids, Google app and WhatsApp easy to use. However, these apps are used by children of a wide age range and, hence, are not niche apps. Wikipedia app requires chil- dren to be able to navigate hypertext. The app is used by children aged seven years and more. Since the value of the parameters c and A are 1.864 and 3.339, respectively, the app is not a niche app but of suitable level of di culty. Figure 3 shows the plots of the Gaussian functions for these apps. 4. Discussion 4.1. Relevance of the Level of Di culty. Children prefer smartphones over other digital devices because of their nar- row gulf of execution. Children should possess su ciently developed motor skills and expressive abilities to enjoy an immersive experience while using smartphone apps [18]. However, many of the smartphone apps developed for chil- dren do not take into account the psychomotor abilities of the children. If children do not possess the skills required to use an app, then they nd it di cult to use. Children typ- ically ignore apps they nd di cult to use even though they are interested in their contents. For example, children youn- ger than seven years cannot use augmented reality software and are not fond of games that use augmented reality [13]. The target age group should be rst identi ed when developing an app [19]. It should then be ensured that using the app requires only the skills that children of the target age group possess [20]. Children are thrilled by apps that require the skills they have acquired recently. For example, seven to ten year old children nd drawing apps with the pinch and zoom feature enticing. Ideally, the value of the parameter A should be between 0 and 3.5 for apps meant for children. If using an app does not require the skills that the chil- dren have acquired lately, then they nd that app too easy and look for more challenging apps. However, children do use easy apps if their contents are refreshingly new [21]. For example, children like to watch new videos on YouTube Kids although its interface is too simple. 4.2. Relevance of Niche Apps. In this study, we analyzed two drawing apps, viz. Baby s Drawing and Sketch Draw and Paint. Baby s Drawing is a simple drawing app with limited features developed speci cally for a narrow age range of chil- dren. Alternatively, Sketch Draw and Paint is a profes- sional quality drawing app with sophisticated features that can be used by users of all ages. Children like to draw with apps [7]. They can scribble and draw with Baby s Drawing and rarely complain about the paucity of features in the app. On the other hand, children get distracted by the mul- tiplicity of features in Sketch Draw and Paint. They do not know which features to use and get frustrated when they are unsuccessful in using a feature that requires advanced skills. We recommend the development of niche apps for children. Such apps may be designed speci cally according to the abil- ities and interests of children of a particular age group. The value of the parameter c should ideally be less than or equal to 1 for apps meant for children. Di erent versions of the same app may be developed for children of di erent age groups, if necessary. For example, drawing apps of increas- ing sophistication may be developed for children aged two to six years, seven to ten years and older children. 4.3. Utility of the Work. The model can be used to identify niche apps and apps of suitable di culty level for children of di erent age groups. The model will also help software developers to understand the relationship between the abil- ity of children to use smartphone apps and their interest in actually using those apps, and thus help in the development of apps that are better suited for children. 4.4. Limitations. The model covers only smartphone apps and does not cover other digital contents accessed by chil- dren. A more comprehensive model taking into consider- ation children s interaction with di erent type of digital Table 1: Skills required to use smartphone apps.

Conclusion We have developed a mathematical model for the ability and interest of children to use smartphone apps. The model can be used to determine the level of di culty of apps. An app developed for a particular age group should require the skills that the children in that age group have acquired recently. Children get frustrated if an app is too di cult to use. Chil- dren are also not fond of apps that are too easy to use. The model can also be used to identify niche apps that are cus- tomized according to the interest of a narrow age range of children. We recommend that children be provided with niche apps of suitable di culty level. Data Availability The paper is mathematical in nature and no empirical data has been used.
