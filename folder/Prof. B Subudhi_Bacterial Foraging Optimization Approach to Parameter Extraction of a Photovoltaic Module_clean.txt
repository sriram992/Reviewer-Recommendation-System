In a PV system, validation of the model of a PV module with correctly chosen parameters is essential. An efficient parameter extraction method is required to estimate the parameters of PV module. Although, a number of parameter extraction methods are available in literature but there is a need to explore parameter extraction methods that could extract globally optimized parameters in changing weather conditions. One of the recent evolutionary computing approaches called BFO exhibits global optimization performance. Therefore, we employ BFO for extraction of parameters of a PV module. The proposed BFO based parameter extraction method has been tested for different types of PV modules at different test conditions. Analyzing both the simulation and experimental results obtained using BFO; it is found that the module parameters are more accurate compared to that of Newton- Raphson, Particle Swarm Optimization and Enhanced Simulated Annealing methods.

INTRODUCTION Recently, demand of PV energy has increased many fold as it is a promising renewable energy source. For efficient utilization of the available PV energy, the PV system should operate at its maximum power point (MPP). Therefore, an efficient maximum power point tracker (MPPT) is necessary. Since, MPPT is an essential component of a PV system, a lot of research is being pursued in this area and several MPPT B.Subudhi is working as Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India-769008. R. Pradhan is working as Assistant Prof. in the Department of Electrical Engineering, VSSUT Burla. E-mail: bidyadhar@nitrkl.ac.in, rase1512@gmail.com techniques [1] have been proposed and implemented. To test any MPPT technique before its physical implementation, there is a necessity of verification through computer simulations. Hence, an accurate mathematical model of the PV module is essential for computer simulation analysis. Mathematical models of a PV module such as two-diode and single-diode models are available in literature [2]. Although behavior of a two-diode model closely matches with that of the physical PV module but the model is very complex and its mathematical analysis is difficult. In view of these disadvantages, a single-diode model is popularly used [2]. An ideal single-diode model is assumed to be lossless and does not have Rs and Rsh. Although this is simple but does not represent an accurate structure of a PV module. To improve the accuracy, both the resistances Rs and Rsh have been considered in the PV module as shown in Fig.1 [3]. This model is represented by five parameters i.e. Iph, I0, Rs, Rsh and a . It is known as single-diode-five-parameter model. Fig.1. Single-diode-five parameter Electrical model of a PV module Usually, the manufacturers data-sheet of a PV module provides only a few information on PV module namely Isc, Voc, Impp and Vmpp at STC. Hence, all the parameters Rs, Rsh, a, I0 and Iph of the model (Fig.1) are unknown. As these parameters need to be evaluated using a parameter extraction algorithm to design the mathematical model of a PV module. An analytical method has been reported in [4] in which the mathematical model of a PV module is represented by an empirical relationship between voltage V and current I. This empirical relation between V and I can be determined by measuring V and I at different loads. The empirical relation between V and I is determined at the STC, hence although this analytical method performs efficiently at the STC but is found to be unsuitable using a single-diode-five-parameter model for wide range of varied weather conditions [3, 5]. In another method [3], parameters of a PV module namely, Rs, Rsh, a, I0 and Iph are determined iteratively by varying each of these parameters in five dependent loops until the maximum power of the PV module matches with the power at the MPP. This method is simple and accurate but consumes a lot of time as it involves with five loops and a number of equations. It is also not reliable for other weather conditions other than the STC Bidyadhar Subudhi, Senior Member, IEEE and Raseswari Pradhan Bacterial Foraging Optimization Approach to Parameter Extraction of a Photovoltaic Module 1949-3029 (c) 2017 IEEE.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TSTE.2017.2736060, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy 2 because the maximum power at the STC is only known from manufacturer s data-sheet. In parameter extraction approach [6], the above five loop problem has been simplified to a single loop problem by assuming the parameter a as constant and Iph and I0 with equations that are dependent on Rs, Rsh and a. In this method, Rsh is calculated by increasing Rs until the maximum PV power becomes equal to the MPP power. This method is suitable to solve parameter extraction problem accurately at the STC but may fail at other weather conditions, because it assumes values of Rs, Rsh and a which are independent of weather conditions. Newton-Raphson method (NRM) is one of the best root-finding methods because of its accuracy. Hence, NRM has been applied in [3,7] for parameter extraction problem of PV module. But, five independent equations are required to find the values of Rs, Rsh, a, I0 and Iph. Hence, the computation of the Jacobian matrix used in the NRM algorithm is very complex, because the Jacobian matrix consists of twenty-five numbers of double-derivative terms. The Jacobian matrix has been further simplified in [7] for finding Rs, Rsh and a. Here, Iph and I0 are calculated solving two pre-defined equations that are dependent on Rs, Rsh and a. To further simplify the above problem, the parameter a is evaluated iteratively (1 2 a ) and Rs and Rsh are solved by using the NRM until PV power matches with power at the MPP. But, in all these NRM methods [3, 7], singularity problem i.e. division by zero (due to existence of zero value of second derivative term at some voltages and currents) may arise if initial conditions of the parameters (Rs, Rsh, a, I0 and Iph) are chosen improperly. Also, these NRM methods are silent about the boundary limits of the parameters Rs, Rsh and a. A lot of assumptions are taken in [3,7] in order simplify the five-parameter extraction problem which results in low value of Rs and high value of Rsh denoting the ideal conditions of PV module. Hence, there lies incorrectness on the validity of the parameters extracted by these NRMs. To resolve these issues, metaheuristics methods such as evolutionary computational algorithms can be used because these evolutionary algorithms are capable of accurate optimization in solution even where traditional mathematics fails. Since the fitness function for the parameter extraction problem is a multi-modal optimization problem, evolutionary algorithms are suitable compared to the classical optimization techniques. A number of parameter extraction problems. But it is found that for the above problem, employing Genetic Algorithm (GA) has number of demerits such as low convergence speed and degradation of highly interactive fitness functions. Simulated Annealing (SA) method also employed for the PV module parameter extraction problem [8]. But it is seen in SA that there is trade-off between the cooling schedule and initial temperature. Due to these shortcomings of both SA and GA, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been employed for PV module parameter extraction problem, which has been found to provide improved solutions e.g. accurate module parameters [9]. But if the number iterations are increased, better results can be obtained with PSO compared to GA. To accurately model the PV module, an improved modeling approach using Differential Evolution (DE) method is discussed in [10]. Such approach enables the computation of model parameters at changing insolation and temperature point using the information given in the datasheet. But to determine the control parameters for employing DE algorithm it is quite challenging. Therefore, an improved adaptive DE (IADE) based optimization technique is proposed in [11] which uses a simple structure based on the feedback of fitness value in the evolutionary process. In [12], a two diode model of a PV cell consisting of seven parameters is used for parameter extraction using a penalty based DE at different environmental conditions. An improved DE with adaptive mutation per iteration algorithm (DEAM) has been proposed in [13] to find the parameters of a module. This extraction scheme employs the electromagnetism concept for adjustment of scaling factor in mutation and crossover rate to achieve improved performance of the DE and obtained parameters are found to be in close agreement with experimental data. A different variant of optimization approach called Flower Pollination Algorithm (FPA) has been applied in [14] to extract the PV module parameters which provides good results of parameter extraction at low irradiance levels. In [15], a good review on different parameter extraction methods applied to determine optimal parameters of a PV model has been pursued. It is observed PSO approach is very effective for PV module parameter extraction problem. In [16- 18], performances of five such evolutionary computational approaches i.e. GA, memetic algorithms, PSO, ant-colony systems and shuffled frog leaping have been compared. It has been demonstrated in [18], that PSO performs better than that of other four algorithms in terms of success rate and solution quality. The proposed BFO method exploits advantages like accuracy of solution, consistency of solution and speed of convergence which outperforms other evolutionary techniques like SA, GA and PSO. The PSO based parameter extraction method which is presented in [9] considers inverse barrier constraints for Rs, Rsh and a. It obtains optimized values of parameters Rs, Rsh and a at any temperature condition. This method neither depends upon the initial condition nor on the gradient information. Since it depends only on the value of the objective function, it makes the algorithm computationally inexpensive, simple to implement and has low CPU and memory requirements. However, some experimental results show that although the global search ability of PSO is quite good but the local search ability around the optima is very poor [18]. This results in premature convergence in problems where multiple optima exist and hence, the performance is degraded. Recently, another biologically inspired global optimization technique called BFO has been employed in many problems [18-19]. Use of BFO algorithm has following advantages: (a) It is based on natural selection that tends to eliminate solutions with poor foraging strategies, (b) Elimination of premature convergence (c) Faster convergence speed than that of PSO and (d) Better final accuracy than that of PSO [18]. Further, an Enhanced Simulated Annealing approach has been suggested in [20].Therefore, in this paper, first, the BFO algorithm has been chosen for optimal determination of parameters (Rs, Rsh and a) at both variable temperatures and 1949-3029 (c) 2017 IEEE.

Citation information: DOI 10.1109/TSTE.2017.2736060, IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy 4 Further, for any G and T, the values of Isc, Voc and Pmpp can be calculated from the PV module model given by (7), (8) and (10). Isc, Voc and Pmpp can be represented in terms of Rs, Rsh and a. The reference values of short-circuit current (Isc *), open- circuit voltage (Voc *) and MPP power (Pmpp *) can be calculated analytically using (11), (12) and (13) respectively. Difference between [Isc, Voc, Pmpp]T and [Isc * ,Voc * ,Pmpp *]T are the short- circuit current error, open-circuit voltage error and MPP power error respectively. The short-circuit current error (Esc), open-circuit voltage error (Eoc) and MPP power error (Empp) need to be minimized by employing BFO algorithm formulating a suitable fitness function as shown in Fig.2. III. PROPOSED BFO BASED PARAMETER EXTRACTION METHOD A. BFO Algorithm Survival of species in any natural evolutionary process depends upon their fitness criteria, which relies upon their food searching (foraging) and motile behavior. BFO rests on a simple principle of the foraging (food searching) behavior of E. Coli bacterium in human intestine. There are mainly four stages in a BFO optimized process such as chemotactic, swarming, reproduction and elimination and dispersal. In chemotactic stage, a bacterium can move in a predefined direction or change their direction of motion. In swarming, each bacterium provides a signal to other bacterium to move together. In reproduction, the healthiest bacterium split into two and less healthy bacterium die. In elimination and dispersal phase, a sudden unforeseen event occurs, that may drastically alter the smooth process of evolution and cause the elimination of the set of bacteria and disperse them to a new environment. This unknown event may place a newer set of bacteria nearer to the food location.

BFO based Parameter Extraction Method B. BFO Algorithm for Parameter Extraction Problem In section A, it has been discussed that the parameter extraction of a PV module is basically an optimization problem where the errors need to be minimized (Fig.2). This minimization problem is to be accomplished by using the BFO that is described in this section. The fitness function is then solved using BFO algorithm (shown in Fig.3) to evaluate the unknown parameters (Rs, Rsh and a).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The efficacy of the proposed BFO based parameter extraction method is tested using four PV modules (Shell SQ85, Shell SP70, SSI-M6-205 and Shell ST40). These four PV models are verified for some defined test conditions i.e.; solar irradiances G (1000 watts/m2, 800 watts/m2, 600 watts/m2, 400 watts/m2and 200 watts/m2) and temperatures T (-250C, 00C, 250C, 500C and 750C). A. Simulation Results For each test condition, the BFO algorithm was implemented using MATLAB and individual set of parameters (Rs, Rsh and a) were evaluated. For this BFO approach to evaluate Rs, Rsh and a, a set of 200 numbers of populations error of MPP power was calculated using (19).In the simulation of the proposed BFO-Parameter Extraction algorithm, we have considered the following parameters for BFO. 200, 3, 5, 10, 10, 0.1, 0.001, 0.05, 0.3, 0.05, 0.05 c re ed ed attract attract repellant repellant S p N N N P C i d h For ease in simulation and parameters evaluation all the three parameters (Rs, Rsh and a) were considered to be bounded with the inequality constraints as defined in eq (19) and Table I.

This 3D-plot looks like a hilly curve and the global minimum of fitness function for each temperature is the deepest point in this curve. From this figure, it is clear that, for each temperature, the one among the populations that gives this deepest point is the fittest one. This fittest set of parameters (Rs, Rsh and a) were recorded. Using this procedure, the parameters (Rs, Rsh and a) were determined for all the test conditions (G (1000 watts/m2, 800 watts/m2, 600 watts/m2, 400 watts/m2and 200 watts/m2) and temperatures T (-250C, 00C, 250C, 500C and 750C)). Fig.4. Comparison of Fitness Function of Shell SP70 PV Model for different populations at temperature variations The efficacy of the proposed BFO parameter extraction scheme is verified by comparing its performance with three other existing parameter extraction methods proposed in [6,7,9]. The absolute percentage fitness functions calculated by (19) at STC of all the above four parameter extraction methods are compared in Table II. From this comparison, it is confirmed that BFO approach to parameter extraction yields lesser fitness function at STC considering the given mono- crystalline PV module i.e. Shell SQ85 (0.000134%), poly- crystalline PV module i.e. Shell SP70 (0.0016%) or thin-film PV module i.e. ST40 (0.000507%) compared to that of NRM, iterative and PSO parameter extraction methods.

From the obtained values of parameters (Fig.5), it is clear that the proposed BFO method successfully converges to extracted parameters for all the PV modules studied with various test conditions. Fig.6. Comparison of Extracted Parameters of different PV Models using proposed BFO method at -250C to 750C Fig.7 shows error versus temperature curves using BFO parameter extraction method of different PV modules. From this figure, it is clear that BFO method converges to extract PV module parameters for all types of PV modules i.e. mono- crystalline, poly-crystalline and thin-film. Also, BFO converges to an average of less than 0.1% of efit for all PV modules at all temperatures. Similarly, BFO method converges to the extracted parameters of Shell SP70 PV module with an average efit of around 0.005% (Table IV). Hence, the proposed BFO based parameter extraction method performs parameter extraction efficiently at changing solar irradiances also. Fig.7.

Experimental Results For experimental validation of the proposed BFO method, an experiment was conducted on a mono-crystalline PV module whose data-sheet parameters are as follows. 21.7 1.85 30 oc sc mpp V volts I amps P watts (21) The circuit diagram and photo of experimental set-up for the above experiment are shown in Fig.8 (a) and (b) respectively. In this set-up, a rheostat of 8.5A and 35 rating was connected across the PV module. For measuring the voltage and current of the PV module, a 0-30V moving coil (MC) voltmeter and a 0-3A MC ammeter were used. Changing the load, the voltage and current of the PV module were measured and recorded. Power of the PV module was then calculated by multiplying the recorded voltage and current. Using the recorded values of voltage, current and power, I-V and P-V characteristics were plotted. (a) (b) Fig.8. (a) Circuit of Experimental set-up and (b) Photograph of the experimental set-up. Fig.9 shows the comparison between the experimentally obtained and the BFO simulated P-V characteristics. It can be seen from this figure that the simulated P-V characteristic using BFO extracted parameters more closely matches with the experimentally obtained P-V characteristic compared to that of PSO simulated P-V characteristics.

Comparison of P-V characteristics using Extracted Parameters of PM648 PV Model using proposed BFO Method at Unshaded condition and partially shaded condition Again, the BFO simulated curve is compared with that of the Enhanced Simulated Annealing (ESA) [20] curve as shown in Fig.13. From this figure it can be seen that BFO simulated curve is better than that of ESA. Fig.13. Comparison of P-V characteristics using Extracted Parameters of SP70 PV Model using proposed BFO Method and ESA method at STC The speed of convergence of BFO algorithm as compared to other methods such as NRM, PSO and ESA has been tabulated in Table V for two different PV modules namely, Shell SP70 and SSI-M6-205. Further, in order to verify the robustness of the proposed estimation scheme, we considered the estimation performance with change in solar irrdiances from 200 watts/m2 to 1000 watts/m2. From Table V, it can be anlaysed that the convergence time in case of BFO algorithm is lesser than that of PSO and ESA algorithms both for Shell SP70 and SSI-M6-205 PV modules. TABLE V.

From this table, it can be seen that the percentage deviation of BFO, ESA and PSO simulated peak power from that of average experimentally obtained peak power is found to be 0.08%, 1.406% and 1.42% respectively. This proves that BFO simulated curve is more close to the experimental curve than that of ESA and PSO. Same experimental verification has been done taking SSi-M6-205 PV module and the results are shown in table V. These results also prove that BFO simulated curve is more close to the experimental curve than that of ESA and PSO. 1949-3029 (c) 2017 IEEE.

CONCLUSIONS In this paper, a new parameter extraction method exploiting Bacterial Foraging Optimization technique has been proposed for estimating unknown parameters of PV modules considering a single diode model. This PV module parameter extraction scheme provides robustness in parameter determination for a wide range of weather conditions such as varied temperature and solar irradiance levels. The approach is applicable for extracting parameters of different types PV modules i.e. mono-crystalline, poly-crystalline and thin-film modules. Parameters obtained through this method are found to be more accurate compared to many other approaches such as PSO and ESA. In future paper we will be extending the application of this parameter extraction scheme to double diode models of PV module. REFERENCES [1]. B.Subudhi and R.
