Gupta & Arjun Kumar & Himanshu Mittal Received: 17 July 2013 /Accepted: 26 November 2013 # Saudi Society for Geosciences 2013 Abstract A data set of 60 local events (1.9 Mw 3.6) col- lected by a temporary digital network deployed in the Siang region of Arunachal Lesser Himalaya during July 2011 to Feburary 2012 is analysed to study the source parameters and fmax. The software EQK_SRC_PARA (Kumar et al. in Int J Geosci 3(5):1142 1149, 2012) that considers Brune s model with a high-frequency diminution factor (Boore in Bull Seismol Soc Am 73:1865 1894, 1983) has been used to estimate the spectral parameters namely: low-frequency dis- placement spectral level ( 0), corner frequency (fc) and fmax. These obtained spectral parameters are used to estimate source parameters, namely: seismic moment, source dimension and stress drop and to study the characteristics of fmax in this region. Seismic moment varies from 6.13 1018 dyn-cm to 3.15 1021 dyn-cm; the source radii vary from about 175 to 357 m. The stress drops of these events vary from 0.2 to 56 bars and shows general increasing trend with increase in seismic moment. Various plots of both fc and fmax with seis- mic moment, focal depth, epicentral distance and site showed the same amount of scatters and trends. From this study, it is found that fmax has similar behavior as fc to seismic moment showing that it is also due to source process, and the same amount of scatter in both cut-off frequencies may be due to either source complexities or site effects or both. Both fc and fmax seems independent of epicentral distance and focal depth. Relationships between fmax and seismic moment and stress drop are obtained. Keywords Source parameters . fmax, Lower Siang . Arunachal Lesser Himalaya Introduction Earthquake source parameters play an important role towards understanding the kinematic and dynamic properties of earth- quake source as well as for understanding the seismotectonics of an area and hence for seismic hazard assessment. Earth- quake source parameters are generally estimated from the radiated seismic wave-fields. Aki (1967) examined the depen- dence of the amplitude spectrum of seismic waves on source size on the basis of two dislocation models ( 3 model and 2 model) of an earthquake source. The 2 model gives a satis- factory agreement with such observations on the assumption of similarity, but the 3 model does not. Brune (1970, 1971) modeled an earthquake source as a tangential stress pulse applied instantaneously to the interior of a dislocation surface. This model employs three independent parameters (moment, source dimension and fractional stress drop) that determine the shape of the far-field displacement spectrum of body waves. He constrained the relationship of the corner frequency to the fault radius by assuming that the effective stress was equal to the average static stress drop. In the earthquake source models, the acceleration spectrum increases with increasing frequency and become constant beyond corner frequency. Hanks (1982) observed that there is another frequency called the maximum cut-off frequency fmax above which acceleration spectral amplitudes diminish abruptly. fmax is important from earthquake engineering point of view as it controls the peak ground acceleration. There is a controversy about the origin of this cut-off frequency, fmax. However, most of the studies attribute this to the source (e.g. Papageorgiou and Aki 1983a, b; Faccioli 1986; Aki 1987; Papageorgiou 1988; Fujiwara and Irikura 1991; Yokoi and Irikura 1991; Kinoshita 1992; Tsurugi et al. 2000, 2008; Wen R.

Earlier studies by Anderson and Hough (1984) and Anderson (1986, 1991) related this high-cut fall- off to near-surface attenuation, but a recent study by Purvance and Anderson (2003) supports that the high-cut fall-off is primarily controlled by source characteristics as opposed to propagation path effects. Kumar et al. (2013a, b) observed that fmax has similar dependence as to fc for source size, epicentral distance, focal depth and site characteristics. They observed fmax seems to be controlled by source process and is indepen- dent of epicentral distance and focal depth. In the present study, source parameters, namely: seismic moment, source dimension and stress drop and another ob- servable spectral parameter f max and its relationship with source, focal depth, epicentral distance and site have been studied using a data set of 60 local events (1.9 Mw 3.6) that occurred from July 2011 to February 2012, collected by a temporary digital network deployed in the Siang region of Arunachal Lesser Himalaya. Seismotectonics of the study area Among the most dramatic and visible creations of plate tectonic forces are the lofty Himalayas, which stretch 2,900 km along the border between India and Tibet. This great mountain range began to form between 40 and 50 million years ago, when two large landmasses, India and Eurasia, driven by plate movement, collided. Because both these continental landmasses have about the same rock density, one plate could not be subducted under the other, so this collision creates structural features in the Himalayas. Figure 1 depicts a topographic map along with major tectonic fronts of the Indian Plate on north edge along the Himalayas, i.e. Hazara Arc, Himalayan Arc and Burmese Arc; the area of study (Lower Siang) is also shown by a red box in the map. The Himalayas can be divided structurally (tectonically) from north to south as: Tibetan Himalaya (Northwest part of Arunachal Himalaya bordering Bhutan and Tibet, trending NE SW), Higher Himalaya (limits between Tibetan Himalaya and MCT, ENE WSW trend adjacent to Bhutan and changes to NE SW eastward), Lesser Himalaya (limits between Higher Himalaya and sub-Himalaya, trending E W in western part, swinging NNE SSE till the syntaxial then NW SE), sub- Himalaya (trending E W near Bhutan, swings ENE WSW towards east) and the division from east to west: The Eastern Himalaya, Central Himalaya and western Himalaya. (e.g. Gansser 1964; Le Fort 1975). In the northeastern part of India, is Arunachal Pradesh which mostly occupied by the high mountain range of eastern Himalayas. The Himalayan range enters in Arunachal Pradesh from Bhutan at the west of Kameng district, and the altitude in this region varies from 800 7,000 m above mean sea level. It runs through the northwards region over the Kangto region before ending at the easternmost part of Arunachal Himalaya, i.e. The Namcha Barwa Massif. This part of the Himalayas Fig. 1 Map depicts topographic map along with major tectonic fronts of the Indian Plate on north edge along the Himalaya, i.e. Hazara Arc, Himalayan Arc and Burmese Arc. The area of study is also shown as a red box in the map Arab J Geosci includes extensive faulting and over-folding as the major structural element. The regional structural trend of the eastern Himalayas is mostly E W to ENE WSW from Bhutan to the northeastern Arunachal Pradesh, which changes gradually to NE SW near Siang valley and terminates against Siang frac- ture (e.g. Nandy 1976). Geotechnically, the Arunachal Pradesh can be divided into four geotechnical blocks: the Himalaya, the Mishimi hills, Nagapatkoi ranges of the Arkon Yomo Mountain and Brahmaputra Basin; each of these have experienced intense stages of tectonic development in re- sponse to collision of plates and uplift of the Himalayas (Kumar 1997). From the broad description above, the study region, lower Siang of Siang valley is in Arunachal Himalaya Table 1 Crustal velocity model used for estimation of hypocenter parameters for earthquakes of Siang region of Arunachal Lesser Himalaya P-wave velocity (km/s) Depth (km) Type of rocks Reference 4.00 0.0 Sedimentary Khattri et al. 1983 (used in the present study) 6.00 1.0 Granitic 6.70 25.0 Basaltic 8.10 45.0 Moho Fig. 2 Map showing epicenters of events recorded during July 2011 to February 2012 (solid circles).

This region is in seismic zone V as per IS Code (IS 1893 (Part 1): 2002) of India. This region shows polyphase deformation, and three stages could be recognised in the region. Six major lithotectonic belts with different litho-stratigraphic settings and defor- mation patterns separated from one another by regional thrust planes are present in the valley (e.g. Singh and Chowdhary 1990). Like the other parts of Himalaya, the eastern most Himalaya of Arunachal Pradesh exhibits quiet high seis- micity and lies within the seismic zone V as per IS Code (IS 1893 (Part 1): 2002). Several earthquakes of smaller to moderate magnitudes have occurred in this region (Verma et al. 1976; Mukhopadhayay 1984; Kayal 1987). The two great earthquakes namely Shillong (1897) and Assam (1950) earthquakes having magni- tudes 8.1 and 8.6, respectively, fell in close proximity to the study region. Shillong earthquake on June 12, 1897 (M w, 8.1) located near the northern edge of Shillong Plateau while Assam earthquake on August 15, 1950, located in Mishmi hills. On September 18, 2011, the Sikkim earthquake of magnitude M w 6.9 occurred in proximity to study region. Data used in the study A six-station network has been deployed in the lower Siang region of Siang valley for collecting the local earthquake data to examine the seismicity of the region. Three types of sensors have been used for carrying out the study: short-period seismom- eter, broad band seismometer and an accelerometer. Out of six stations, five are short-period seismometers CMG-40 T1 (Guralp Systems Limited, UK) with sampling rate 100 sps; one is a broad band seismometer CMG-40 T (Guralp Systems Limited, UK) with sampling rate 100 sps; at one station a short-period seis- mometer has been deployed, an accelerometer CMG-5TC (Guralp Systems Limited, UK) with the purpose of comparing results with seismometer. Each digital seismograph comprised of a 24-bit portable data acquisition system (DL-24) coupled to sensors. A Global Positioning System was used to synchronise data samples to UTC or IST. The local earthquake data collected from digital seismographs during July 2011 to February 2012 have been used in this study.

In this study, Brune s model that yields a fall-off of 2 beyond corner frequency is considered with high-frequency diminution factor; a Butterworth high-cut filter presented by Boore (1983) that fits well for frequencies greater than fmax is fitted in observed acceleration spectrum as A R; f 2 f 2 0 1 f =f c 2 1 f =f max N h i1=2 1 And for displacement spectrum D R; f 0 1 f =f c 2 1 f =f max N h i1=2 2 Computer software EQK_SRC_PARA (Kumar et al. 2012) has been used for analysis using the above source model and estimates the spectral parameters, viz. low-frequency dis- placement spectral level ( 0), corner frequency (f c) and high-cut frequency (fmax). The average values of the spectral parameters from different sites have been used to estimate the earthquake source parameters namely seismic moment (M0), source radius (r) and stress drop ( ).

The velocity model in Table 1 for Shillong masiff given by Khattri et al. (1983) provided the best estimates of hypocenter parameters with minimum standard errors in the estimated parameters. Therefore, this velocity model has been adopted for estimating the hypocenter parameters. The standard errors in the estima- tion of hypocenter parameters for these events are 0.50 s in origin time (RMS), 5.0 km in epicenter (ERH) and 5.0 km in focal depth (ERZ). These events approximately occur with- in hypocentral distances of about 120 km from various re- cording stations. All the 60 events were simultaneously re- corded at three or more stations. Attempts have been made to estimate the hypocenter parameters of all the events simulta- neously recorded at three or more stations. The epicenters of these events are plotted in Fig. 2. Estimation of spectral and source parameters A data set of 60 local events recorded on three compo- nent short-period and broad band seismometers with the sampling rate of 100 samples per second during July 2011 to February 2012 has been used to estimate the source parameters. The digital time series of local events have been corrected for baseline correction and for instrument response. For path correction, a frequency-dependent attenuation relation (100f 0.98), de- veloped for the region from coda-waves of local earth- quakes, has been applied (EQ: 2006-02). From the corrected source spectrum, the values of spectral param- eters, viz. 0, f c and f max were estimated using software EQK_SRC_PARA (Kumar et al. 2012), and the source parameters of the events have been estimated. A typical example of the time series of local earthquakes along with the estimated source spectra are depicted in Fig. 3 given below. The estimated hypocenter parameters and source parame- ters, namely, seismic moment, source radius and stress drop for these events have been estimated and are listed in Table 2. Results and discussions Various plots have been prepared to study the charac- teristics of computed source parameters and the rela- tionship among these parameters. These plots are discussed below: fc = -0.0066 * DEPI + 5.1108 R = 0.0653 fmax = -0.0161 * DEPI + 12.806 R = 0.0627 1 10 100 10 60 110 160 frequency (hz) Epicentral distance (Km) AYENG Fig. 9 Plot between epicentral distance (DEPI) and fc and fmax Fig. 10 Plot of fc and fmax with seismic moment for a Addipa site, b Aholi site, c Ayeng site and c Lendum site Arab J Geosci Source radius versus seismic moment Figure 4 shows the variation of source radius versus seismic moment for the 60 events. The linear curves corresponding to static stress drops of 0.1, 1 bar, 10 and 100 bars are also plotted. The source dimensions in terms of radius of the circular fault vary from about 175 to 357 m. Stress drop The stress drops of these events vary from 0.2 to 56 bars and show large scatter (Fig. 3). Similar values of stress drops for microearthquakes have also been reported by other investigators (e.g. Archuleta et al. 1982; Dysart et al. 1988; Abercrombie1995; Garcia et al. 1996; Wu et al. 1999; Jin et al. 2000; Tusa and Gresta 2008; Kumar et al. 2006; Sule 2010; Kumar et al. 2012). The low value of stress drop might suggest that some microearthquake in this region should be associated with a brittttle shear failure machenism on the fault segment and/or a presence of weakened zones where the earthquake may be trig- gered by low stress regimes. Plot in Fig. 5 depicts the variation of stress drop with focal depth shows there is nothing any trend of stress drop with increasing focal depth. fmax: It is a matter of active debate as to whether the fmax observed in the acceleration spectrum of an earthquake reflects the source characteristics or is on account of attenuation due to subsurface geological characteristics below the recording site (e.g. Hanks 1982; Papageorgiou and Aki 1983a; b; Campillo 1983; Ander- son and Hough 1984; Anderson 1986, 1991; Morikawa and Sasatani 2000). The values of f max and seismic moment, M 0, are plotted in Fig. 6 to allow comparison with the worldwide values of f max complied by Aki (1988). The observed values of f max agrees with world- wide observations. Figure 7 showing the variations of fc and fmax with seismic moment has been drawn to study the relationship to seismic source. Although the dataset shows large scatter, it seems from the plot that there is a similar decreasing trend for both fc and fmax with increasing seismic moment or source size. Hence, it is concluded that fmax has similar dependence as f c on seismic source. Figures 8 and 9 depict plots of fc and fmax to focal depth and epicentral distance. In both plots, a large scatter in data that follows a parallel trend to focal depth and epicentral distance has been observed, thus, dependence of fmax on focal depth and epicentral distance of earthquakes can also be excluded. In order to study the dependence of fmax with the site characteristics, values of f c and f max are plotted between seismic moments for each site. The plots shown in Fig. 10a, b, c and d indicate similar scatter and almost parallel trends for both fc and fmax with increasing seismic moment. Thus, this indicates that fmax has similar behavior as fc to seismic moment on each site that shows it is also due to source process and gets affected by site effects in a similar manner as fc. In a similar study by Tsai and Chen (2000), they fitted a regression model in terms of distance, earth- quake magnitude and site and showed that the high- cut process is controlled by both the site and source effects. They also inferred that distance is the least significant parameter controlling the high-cut process. Similar results have been presented by Kumar et al. (2013a, b) for local events that occurred in the Kameng region of Arunachal Lesser Himalaya and Bilaspur re- gion of Himachal Lesser Himalaya. 1E+18 1E+19 1E+20 1E+21 1E+22 1E+23 1.0 10.0 100.0 Seismic Moment (dyn-cm) fmax M0 fmax -9.0 (Aki, 1986) M0 fmax -8.34 (Faccoili, 1986) M0 fmax -7.307 (This study) Fig. 11 Scaling laws proposed by Aki and Papageoriou (1988) (dotted line), Faccoili (1986) (broken line) and by this study (solid line) are shown in the figure Arab J Geosci In the following, relationships of f max with seismic moment and stress drop from the local earthquakes that occurred in this region have been obtained: M 0 dyne cm 7  1027 f max 7:307 bars 6  106 f max 5:854 Some of the researchers have reported the relationship between fmax and seismic moment as given below: logfmax= 0.12logM0+3.864 (Faccioli 1986) logfmax= 0.018logM0+1.58 (Satoh et al. 1997) log = 2.91logM0+5.8 (Satoh et al. 2000) Aki and Papageorgiou (1988) suggested the relationship M0 fmax 9 from data in California, and Faccioli (1986) ob- tained relationship M0 fmax 8.39 from data in Italy and Yugo- slavia. In this study, a relationship, M0 fmax 7.307 (Fig. 11) is obtained from local earthquakes data, and the difference may be due to the different environments or the earthquakes of small magnitudes studied. Conclusions For the Siang region that falls in the Arunachal Lesser Himalaya, source parameters and fmax of 60 local events have been estimated and interpreted. The 60 local events studied have moment magnitudes between 1.9 and 3.6. The source dimensions in terms of radius of the circular fault vary from about 175 to 357 m. The stress drops of these events vary from 0.2 to 56 bars. The variation of stress drop with focal depth shows no relation of stress drop with increasing focal depth. The fmax estimated from these local earthquakes conforms to the worldwide observations made by Aki (1988). Depen- dence of f max on source, depth of occurrence, epicentral distance and site has been studied on the basis of comparative dependency of fc and fmax. The various plots of both fc and fmax with seismic moment, depth, epicentral distance and site showed the same amount of scatters and trends. From this study, it is found that fmax has similar behavior as fc to seismic moment that shows it is also due to source process and gets affected by site effects in a similar manner as fc. Both fc and fmax are found independent of epicentral distance and depth of occurrence. Similar results have been presented by Kumar et al. (2013a, b) for local events occurring in the Kameng region of Arunachal Lesser Himalaya and Bilaspur region of Himachal Lesser Himalaya.
