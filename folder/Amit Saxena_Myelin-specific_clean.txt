Myelin-speci c T cells also recognize neuronal autoantigen in a transgenic mouse model of multiple sclerosis Gurumoorthy Krishnamoorthy1, Amit Saxena2, Lennart T Mars2, Helena S Domingues1,3, Reinhard Mentele4,5, Avraham Ben-Nun6, Hans Lassmann7, Klaus Dornmair1,4,9, Florian C Kurschus1,8,9, Roland S Liblau2,9 & Hartmut Wekerle1 We describe here the paradoxical development of spontaneous experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in transgenic mice expressing a myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-speci c T cell antigen receptor (TCR) in the absence of MOG. We report that in Mog-de cient mice (Mog / ), the autoimmune response by transgenic T cells is redirected to a neuronal cytoskeletal self antigen, neuro lament-M (NF-M). Although components of radically different protein classes, the cross-reacting major histocompatibility complex I-Ab restricted epitope sequences of MOG35 55 and NF-M18 30 share essential TCR contact positions. This pattern of cross-reaction is not speci c to the transgenic TCR but is also commonly seen in MOG35 55 I-Ab reactive T cells. We propose that in the C57BL/6 mouse, MOG and NF-M response components add up to overcome the general resistance of this strain to experimental induction of autoimmunity. Similar cumulative responses against more than one autoantigen may have a role in spontaneously developing human autoimmune diseases. Organ-speci c autoimmune disease is a key group of in ammatory disorders that includes rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes mellitus, thyroiditis and multiple sclerosis. The prevailing thinking is that the pathogenic changes are typically initiated and driven by T cells, which express receptors for autoantigens restricted to, or enriched within, the particular target tissues. Unfortunately, it has been impossible so far to identify, with certainty, which autoantigens are the targets in individual humans. One reason for this limitation is the complexity of the human autoimmune response. Indeed, there is evidence that in one person more than one self antigen may be the target of the autoimmune attack and that, in addition, the pro le of target autoantigens may uctuate over time1. Furthermore, the peripheral immune repertoire of healthy humans contains a large number of T cells speci c for many, if not all, autoantigens potentially related to autoimmune diseases2. There is no practical assay to distinguish T cells with high pathogenic potential from nonpathogenic counterparts and, more- over, to identify in humans the T cells participating in the patho- genesis from those that are uninvolved. We report here a new mechanism of autoimmunity, cumulative autoimmunity , that may provide a solution to this dilemma. Cumulative autoimmunity designates an autoimmune response that targets more than one particular cognate autoantigenic target at the same time, and the accumulation of these responses results in a tissue attack of enhanced vigor. We observed a cumulative autoimmune response in transgenic mice with a TCR selected for reactivity to MOG peptide35 55, who develop spontaneous EAE in the presence of MOG and, unexpectedly, also in its absence. We found that in Mog-de cient mice, the transgenic T cells recognize a peptide fragment of the medium-sized neuro lament NF-M. RESULTS Spontaneous EAE in the absence of MOG In an experiment designed to detail the role of the autoantigen in spontaneous autoimmunity, we bred transgenes encoding the MOG- speci c TCR 2D2 (ref. 3) and immunoglobulin heavy chain speci c for MOG (IgHMOG) (ref. 4) either separately or together into Mog / mice5 (Fig. 1). To our surprise, spontaneous EAE developed in Mog- de cient 2D2 transgenic mice (2D2  Mog / ) with incidence and kinetics indistinguishable from those of wild-type (WT) counterparts. Between 15% and 20% of 2D2  Mog / mice developed spontaneous EAE (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1 online). Mog / mice and the Mog-de cient IgHMOG mice (IgHMOG  Mog / ), whose B cells, but not T cells, are speci c for MOG, remained healthy (Fig. 1a Received 10 June 2008; accepted 29 April 2009; published online 31 May 2009; doi:10.1038/nm.1975 1Department of Neuroimmunology, Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology, Martinsried, Germany. 2Institut National de la Sante et de la Recherche Me dicale, Unite 563, Universite Toulouse III, Paul-Sabatier, Toulouse, France. 3PhD Program in Experimental Biology and Biomedicine, Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal. 4Institute of Clinical Neuroimmunology, University Hospital Grosshadern, Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich, Germany. 5Department for Protein Analytics, Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry, Martinsried, Germany. 6Department of Immunology, The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel. 7Center for Brain Research, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. 8Present address: I.

Fifty percent of double-transgenic 2D2  IgHMOG mice (also known as OSE/Devic mice6) spontaneously develop opticospinal myelitis3,6, but, in a limited cohort of MOG-de cient 2D2  IgHMOG mice, fewer than 15% of the mice developed spontaneous EAE, a proportion similar to the one seen with Mog-de cient 2D2 mice but substantially lower than that in 2D2  IgHMOG Mog-suf cient counterparts (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). Clinically, spontaneous EAE was indistinguishable between Mog- suf cient and Mog-de cient transgenic mice. In all groups, disease started between 7 and 10 weeks of age, with classical paralytic EAE signs and, in a minority of cases, with a spastic component (Supple- mentary Table 1 and Supplementary Movies 1 6 online). The lesions in Mog-suf cient and Mog-de cient groups were indis- tinguishable (data not shown), and they were restricted to the optic nerve and spinal cord6,7. In addition, we have now observed in am- matory in ltrates in the trigeminal ganglia, spinal ganglia, spinal roots and peripheral nerves, despite the absence of MOG within these tissues (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Table 2 online). However, in mice immunized with MOG35 55, the acute EAE lesions were present only in the central nervous system (CNS) and not in the peripheral nervous system (PNS; Fig. 1d). 2D2-transgenic T cells recognize a non-MOG CNS autoantigen EAE in the Mog / mice might be explained by the incomplete deletion of Mog. The Mog knockout strain initially used in this study was created by the insertion of a cassette containing the LacZ and neomycin resistance genes behind the Mog promoter, leaving the MOG coding sequence intact5, which could leave some aberrant MOG expression in 2D2  Mog / mice. However, in line with the original description of the Mog / mice5, western blot analyses with monoclonal as well as polyclonal antibodies did not detect any residual MOG protein expression in Mog / mice (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). To further exclude faulty MOG expression, we bred 2D2 TCR transgenic mice with another line of Mog-knockout mice in which the 5 end of MOG exon 2 encoding the immunodominant MOG35 55 epitope was deleted and replaced by the Cre recombinase gene (MogCre/Cre)8 (Supplementary Fig. 2 online). 2D2-transgenic mice crossed onto the MogCre/Cre background also developed sponta- neous EAE at the same rate as 2D2-transgenic mice (Fig. 1b). Spontaneous EAE in 2D2  Mog / mice could also have been caused by T cells recruited from the endogenous repertoire or by T cells with dual TCR expression expressing both 2D2 and endo- genous receptor chains. Indeed, whereas in 2D2-transgenic mice most CD4+ T cells use the transgenic TCR, there is also a considerable population with endogenous receptors (data not shown). In the absence of MOG, alternative TCRs might be stimulated to mount an attack against an alternative CNS target autoantigen. However, FACS analysis of 2D2 and 2D2  Mog / thymus and spleen did not reveal any considerable differences in cell number or in activation markers such as CD25, CD44 and CD62 ligand (Supplementary Fig. 3 online) or MOG-speci c forkhead box P3 positive T regulatory cells (Supplementary Fig. 4 online). In addition, the CNS in ltrates were predominantly composed of transgenic T cells with only a minor population of endogenous T cells (Supplementary Fig. 5 online). Furthermore, we noted spontaneous EAE in two out of six triple- transgenic Rag2-de cient 2D2  Mog / mice (2D2  Mog /  Rag2 / ), whose T cells express exclusively the transgenic TCR, indicating that transgenic T cells, not endogenous T cells, are the principal agents in the observed EAE. Finally, the transgenic TCR might recognize an endogenous cross- reactive epitope. We tested some of the known encephalitogenic proteins and peptides such as myelin basic protein (MBP), S-100 calcium-binding protein, beta chain (S100b) and proteolipid protein (PLP) amino acids 139 151, but none of them activated the 2D2-expressing T cells (Fig. 2a). Then we compared crude myelin preparations from Mog+/+ and Mog / CNS isolated by classical protocols9,10. Both preparations activated MOG-speci c 2D2-expres- sing cells to a comparable degree when presented by syngeneic bone marrow derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) (Fig. 2a) but did not stimulate ovalbumin-speci c OT-II TCR transgenic T cells, which we used as negative controls. Furthermore, myelin-induced prolifera- tion of 2D2-transgenic T cells was blocked by antibodies to CD4 and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II but not by antibody to CD1d or control rat antibodies (Fig. 2b). a b d CD3 Mac3 Isotype Isotype CNS PNS c H&E Mac3 CD3 LFB Biel Biel 0 0 25 50 Spontaneous EAE incidence (%) 75 100 Time after birth (d) 200 300 0 0 25 50 Spontaneous EAE incidence (%) 75 100 Time after birth (d) 200 300 2D2 IgHMOG 2D2 2D2 Mog / 2D2 IgHMOG Mog / IgHMOG Mog / Mog / 2D2 Mog Cre/Cre 2D2 Mog Cre/Cre Figure 1 Paradoxical development of spontaneous EAE in MOG-speci c 2D2 TCR transgenic mice in two different Mog-de cient strains.

All rights reserved. NF-M peptide cross-reacts with MOG-speci c T cells We systematically fractionated CNS tissue from Mog / mice (Fig. 3). We employed a puri cation regime composed of homogenization, lipid extraction and puri cation of the urea-dissolved proteins by ion- exchange and gel chromatography (Supplementary Fig. 6 online). Among the chromatography fractions presented to 2D2-expressing T cells by syngeneic antigen-presenting cells (BMDCs), we eluted several antigenic fractions from the anion-exchange column (Fig. 3a). Fractionation of Mog-suf cient CNS tissue led to a similar pro le (Fig. 3b). Parallel fractionation of extracts from WT and Mog / CNS with the cation exchange column yielded similar results (Supplemen- tary Fig. 7a,b online). Gel ltration chromatography of both pooled positive fractions (fractions 16 and 17) from the anion exchange column resulted in one fraction (fraction 9) that was recognized by 2D2-expressing T cells (Fig. 4a). SDS-PAGE analysis revealed two prominent bands with molecular masses of approximately 68 kDa and 150 kDa (Fig. 4b). We excised both bands from the gel, in-gel digested them with trypsin and subjected them to matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time-of- ight mass spectrometry. We identi ed the 68-kDa protein as the light chain of mouse neuro lament (NF-L) and the 150-kDa protein as NF-M. We tested the exclusive cross-reactivity of the NF-M with MOG- speci c 2D2-transgenic T cells by an analysis of CNS proteins from NF-M de cient (Nefm / ) mice. None of the ion-exchange chroma- tography fractions from Nefm / mice activated 2D2-transgenic T cells (Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 7c). In addition, we also found that the crude myelin preparations from both Mog / and WT mice that contained abundant amounts of NF-M (Supplementary Fig. 8a online), and not those from the Mog /  Nefm / mice, activated 2D2-transgenic T cells (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 9 online). Full-length MOG, which is highly hydrophobic owing to its three membrane-spanning helices, was found mainly in the urea-insoluble fraction (data not shown). We detected only trace amounts of MOG in the urea-soluble extract but not in any of the 2D2-transgenic T cell activating fractions from Mog-suf cient mice (Supplementary 2D2 OT-II 20,000 17,500 15,000 12,500 10,000 3H incorporation (c.p.m.) 7,500 5,000 2,500 0 Blank Rat MOG MOG35 55 MOG90 110 Guinea pig MBP Rat MBP MBP-pC1 MBP-pC2 MBP-p81 PLP139 151 Mog / myelin WT myelin S100 Ovalbumin Ova323 339 a Rat IgG2a Anti MHC II Rat IgG2b Anti-CD1d Anti-CD4 Rat MOG Mog / myelin WT myelin 15,000 12,500 10,000 *** *** *** *** *** *** *** 3H incorporation (c.p.m.) 7,500 5,000 2,500 0 b Figure 2 MOG-speci c T cells respond to myelin from Mog / mice.

Shown is a representative of two individual protein puri cations (with different pools of Mog / mice, WT mice or Nefm / mice) and stimulation experiments.

Hence, MOG is lost quantitatively during lipid extraction and urea solubilization, and these data exclude the presence of additional cross-reactive antigens, at least in the urea-soluble fraction we examined. An in silico search identi ed a seven amino acid peptide of NF-M nearly identical to the core region of the antigenic peptide MOG38 50 (Fig. 4c), which spans from Tyr40 to Val47 and contains the amino acids Arg41, Phe44, Arg46 and Val47, which are known to be the crucial contact amino acids for the 2D2 TCR and other MOG-speci c T cell lines11,12. These amino acids are completely preserved at identical positions in NF-M18 30; that is, positions Arg21, Phe24, Arg26 and Val27. Another candidate peptide, NF-M225 237, also showed some homology to MOG but lacked the essential residues of the core region (Fig. 4c). 2D2 T cells responded vigorously to the synthetic peptide NF-M18 30 but not to NF-M225 237 (Fig. 5a). In addition, NF-M18 30 induced strong proliferation of 2D2  Rag2 / transgenic T cells, indicating that the cross-reactivity is intrinsic to the transgenic 2D2 TCR (Fig. 5b). This cross- reactivity is not limited to the synthetic MOG and NF-M peptides. 2D2 T cells also recognized the naturally processed recombi- nant MOG and NF-M proteins produced in E. coli (Fig. 5a,b). Notably, NF-M and MOG peptides mixed in a 1:1 ratio induced pro- liferation and cytokine secretion of 2D2- expressing T cells isolated either from the spleen or from the CNS of mice with spontaneous EAE without any signs of toler- ance or anergy (Fig. 5a and Supplementary Fig. 10 online). 2D2-transgenic T cell responses to MOG and NF-M peptides were similar but not identical. In dose-dependent proliferation tests, NF-M18 30 peptide was superior to MOG35 55 and MOG38 50 peptides in indu- cing proliferation (Fig. 5a,b). We con rmed this nding in cytokine assays, in which NF-M stimulated larger interferon-g (IFN-g), interleukin-17 (IL-17), IL-2 and IL-10 releases than did MOG (Fig. 5c). To clarify whether the cross-reactivity of 2D2-expressing T cells with NF-M re ects a private clonotypic response (a response by a single T-cell clone) or represents a more general cross-reactivity between MOG35 55- and NF-M speci c T cells, we isolated fresh MOG35 55- speci c T cells from C57BL/6 mice, expanded them and tested them for reactivity with NF-M.

T cell line, which used Va and Vb regions distinct from the 2D2 TCR (Supplementary Fig. 11a online), readily responded to NF-M18 30 but not to NF-M225 237 or ovalbumin (Ova) amino acids 323 339 (Fig. 6a). Conversely, T cell lines from NF-M immunized mice, also with Va and Vb gene segments different from those in the 2D2 TCR (Supplementary Fig. 11b), cross-reacted with MOG protein and peptides (Fig. 6b). In vivo recognition of NF-M by MOG-speci c T cells To determine whether 2D2-transgenic T cells nd their alternative target (that is, NF-M) in vivo during EAE, we transferred MOG peptide activated, 2D2-transgenic CD4+ T cells to Rag2 / or Rag2 /  Mog / mice. Whereas both recipient groups developed EAE, in Mog-de cient Rag2 / mice the disease was delayed (Supple- mentary Fig. 12 online). We next examined whether NF-M activated 2D2-T cells can also induce EAE. NF-M activated 2D2-expressing T cells triggered EAE in WT hosts, which by incidence and kinetics was comparable to EAE caused by MOG-activated 2D2-expressing T cells (Supplementary Fig. 13a,b online). To assess the impact of soluble MOG peptide tolerization, we transferred in vitro MOG peptide activated 2D2-transgenic T cells into irradiated WT or Mog / mice and injected Ova323 339 or MOG35 55 peptides intravenously. We observed that treatment with MOG peptide delayed the onset of EAE in WT C57BL/6 recipients and, more notably, also in Mog / mice (Supplementary Fig. 13a). Similarly, MOG peptide tolerization lowered the encephalitogenic activity of 2D2-expressing T cells activated in vitro with NF-M peptide (Supplementary Fig. 13b). Furthermore, we tested the encephalito- genic potential of genuine NF-M speci c T cell lines, that is, CD4+ T cells isolated from NF-M primed C57BL/6 mice and pro- pagated by serial NF-M speci c activation. T cells from an NF-M speci c line trans- ferred to C57BL/6 mice induced severe EAE (Fig. 6c). The pathology in these mice was closely similar to that seen after transfer of 2D2-expressing cells in MOG-de cient mice. Lesions were most pronounced in the spinal cord and featured in ammation by T cells and macrophages (Fig. 6c), con uent demye- lination and severe axonal loss (data not shown). We transferred NF-M peptide activated transgenic T cells derived from 2D2  Rag2 / mice into both Mog / and WT mice. These monoclonal 2D2  Rag2 / T cells induced EAE in Mog / mice, albeit with a delayed onset as compared to WT recipients, con rming the autonomous cap- ability of 2D2-expressing T cells to recognize the alternative target, NF-M (Fig. 6d). The lesions developing in Mog / recipient mice injected with 2D2  Rag2 / T cells were severe, with large in ltrates in the spinal cord and cerebellum (Fig. 6d) and, remark- ably, also in the trigeminal ganglia and in peripheral nerves (data now shown). These ndings are reminiscent of the pathology seen in the spontaneous EAE of 2D2  Mog / mice. To con rm that the 2D2-transgenic T cell mediated lesions in the Mog / recipient mice are due to in vivo recognition of NF-M, we transferred activated 2D2  Rag2 / T cells into Mog /  Nefm / double-knockout mice. None of the double-knockout mice showed any clinical signs of EAE, and there were no lesions in the CNS (Fig. 6d). DISCUSSION C57BL/6 mice are resistant to the induction of most T cell mediated organ-speci c autoimmune diseases. In these mice, immunization with classical autoantigens elicits vigorous T cell responses but commonly fails to produce a clinical autoimmune disease. In contrast, immunization with MOG35 55 peptide reliably induces clinical EAE, thus overcoming resistance of C57BL/6 mice13. Our observations may provide an unexpected clue explaining the unusual autoimmune potential of MOG35 55.

We propose that the combined response to the two target structures may overcome the innate resistance of C57BL/6 mice to autoimmune diseases. It has previously been reported that the 2D2-transgenic C57BL/6 mice that harbor large populations of MOG-speci c CD4+ T cells tend to spontaneously develop optic neuritis and EAE3. This trend is markedly increased in the presence of MOG-speci c transgenic B lymphocytes6,7. Paradoxically, however, as reported here, 2D2 mice develop spontaneous EAE also in the absence of MOG, the primary encephalitogenic target. This was discovered in mice with disrupted exon 1 of the Mog gene5, and it was con rmed in another cohort of Mog-de cient 2D2- transgenic mice, whose Mog gene was deleted by an independent knock-in strategy8, excluding residual, atypical MOG material in these knockout animals as a possible encephalitogenic target. We fractionated CNS tissue from Mog-knockout mice and found material that was presented to and recognized by 2D2-transgenic T cells. We identi ed the autoantigenic component, by classical biochemical methods and subsequent mass spectrometry, as NF-M. The salient target epitope of NF-M was nally determined by an in silico search for sequences related to the MOG35 55 motif recognized by the 2D2 clone11. Given the marked degeneracy of peptide recogni- tion by T cells14, cross-reaction of NF-M by 2D2 at the peptide level may not be very unexpected. However, less trivially, we con rmed NF- M as the stimulatory autoantigen at the protein level using both CNS white matter protein extracts and recombinant proteins. Neuro laments, including NF-M, are produced by neurons and also by some glial cells15. They were characterized recently as auto- antigens in actively induced EAE and as possible targets in multiple sclerosis, too. Immunization of Biozzi ABH (antibody high, AB/H, ABH) mice with the light form of neuro lament, NF-L, causes EAE in a moderate proportion of treated animals16. Also, autoantibodies to NF-M have been detected in the cerebrospinal uid of some indivi- duals with multiple sclerosis17. The CD4+ T cell repertoire of 2D2-transgenic mice is dominated by the transgenic, MOG-reactive TCR but is by no means monoclonal. The NF-M speci c response could have been effected either by T cells from the residual endogenous repertoire or by T cells that escaped allelic exclusion and use endogenous TCR chains along with the transgenic one. We ruled out both possibilities, as 2D2-expressing T cells from Rag2-knockout mice showed a similar heteroclitic (stronger) cross-recognition of NF-M in vitro and in vivo, indistin- guishable from their Rag2-suf cient counterparts. Furthermore, we observed spontaneous EAE in 2D2  Rag2 /  Mog / mice, suggest- ing the autonomous role of transgenic T cells in the cross-recognition. EAE was readily mediated by T cell lines selected for reactivity to either MOG (2D2) or NF-M and by 2D2-expressing T cells activated by NF-M. In contrast, we were unable to induce disease by immuniza- tion with NF-M using protocols that allow active disease induction by MOG35 55 (data not shown). This discrepancy between active and passive EAE induction is, however, not exceptional. It has been previously described for other models, including EAE induced in Lewis rats by glial brillary acidic protein18 and S100-b19 and MBP-induced EAE in BALB/c mice20. Autoimmune cross-reactivity between MOG and NF-M has been discovered and analyzed in one clonal model, 2D2-transgenic T cells, but has been con rmed in other I-Ab restricted MOG- and NF-M speci c CD4+ T cells. MOG- or NF-M primed polyclonal T cell populations isolated from WT C57BL/6 mice show extensive cross-reactivity between NF-M and MOG proteins and their salient epitopes, respectively. Of note, these populations rarely use Va3.2 and Vb11, the variable chains used by the 2D2 clone, indicating that MOG and NF-M cross-reactivity is not limited to the 2D2 TCR. Our in vitro results formally establish the cross-reactivity of 2D2 and other MOG35 55 peptide speci c T cells with NF-M, but do these T cells respond to NF-M in vivo, and might there be additional cross- recognized autoantigens? In vivo NF-M speci c responses are suggested by several lines of evidence. We found lesions in trigeminal and spinal ganglia, tissues which even in WTmice are devoid of MOG autoantigen but contain NF-M. Furthermore, 2D2  Rag2 / T cells transferred into Mog /  Nefm / double-knockout recipients failed to develop EAE. This latter observation, together with the loss of autoantigenic potential of myelin from double-knockout white matter, also rules out unknown autoantigens acting in addition to MOG and NF-M. How would cross-reactive T cells respond to the simultaneous presence of both MOG and NF-M? Would the response components add up or would there be tolerization? Several observations suggest that MOG35 55-speci c T cells respond both to the MOG epitopes as well as to the cross-reactive NF-M epitopes at the same time. In vitro, T cells isolated from CNS and spleen respond to both antigens in an additive fashion. In vivo, transfer of activated 2D2-expressing T cells caused substantially earlier appearance of EAE in Mog-suf cient mice compared to Mog / mice. Also, the clinical picture of Mog-suf cient and Mog-de cient 2D2-transgenic mice is very similar. However, a selective anti-MOG response component seems to prevail in trans- genic mice with transgenic TCRs plus B cell receptors. In the presence of MOG, in T-B double-transgenic mice the incidence of spontaneous EAE rises to rates of 50% and more. In the absence of MOG, these double-transgenic mice develop EAE at proportions similar to their single-TCR transgenic counterparts. The MOG-dependent elevation of spontaneous EAE frequency, noted in double-transgenic 2D2  IgHMOG mice6, is not seen in the absence of MOG. To our knowledge, this is the rst description of immunological self-mimicry, that is, the response of one T cell population to two independent target autoantigens in the same tissue, MOG and NF-M. Is such a response an exception to the norm or is it common? As mentioned, the MOG and NF-M response does not seem to be unique to the MOG-reactive 2D2 clone studied here but is also noted in polyclonal MOG- and NF-M reactive T cell populations from C57BL/6 mice. Furthermore, another case of self mimicry, though between structures from different tissues was reported by another group, who described in the Dark Agouti (DA) rat cross-reaction between MOG- speci c T cells and an epitope of the milk protein butyrophilin21. The dual response of T cells against two target autoantigens expressed within the same target tissue could have major implications for organ- speci c autoimmune disease. It could have an additive role in deter- minant spreading (development of an immune response distinct from the initial disease-causing epitope) in the course of an autoimmune response. Beyond this, we propose that in C57BL/6 mice autoimmune response components directed against MOG and NF-M may accumu- late to overcome the general resistance of these mice to induction of EAE. T cells with similar cumulative double self-reactivity could act as dominant pathogens in human multiple sclerosis, and genetic factors favoring bireactive T cells would enhance susceptibility to the disease. This study should provide a way to identify such T cells in humans and appreciate their role in the pathogenesis of multiple sclerosis.

We bred MOG-speci c TCR transgenic mice (2D2)3 and B cell knock-in IgHMOG (also known as Th)4 on a C57BL/6 background into Mog / mice5 to obtain 2D2  Mog / and IgHMOG  Mog / and 2D2  IgHMOG  Mog / mice. We obtained WT C57BL/6 mice from the animal facility of the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry. We bred Rag2 / mice and OT-II mice (Jackson Laboratories) in the conventional animal facilities along with other transgenic mice. We bred a second Mog / strain (MogCre/Cre) harboring the insertion of the gene encoding Cre recombinase in the rst exon of Mog8 with the 2D2-transgenic mice in the speci c pathogen free animal facility of Institut Fe de ratif de Recherche (IFR30). We also maintained Nefm / mice22 in the speci c pathogen free animal facility of IFR30. We routinely monitored a cohort of transgenic mice of the above genotypes at least one or two times a week for clinical EAE signs. The EAE disease scores were according to the classic scale6. To determine other neurological abnorm- alities, we lifted the mice by their tail and allowed them to grab the grid of a cage by their front limbs (see Supplementary Movies 1 6). We noted the clasping and hyperextension of hind limbs within 10 30 s of holding them by the tail. All animal procedures were in accordance with guidelines of the Committee on Animals of the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology or the Midi-Pyre ne es Ethic Committee on Animal Experimentation and with the license of the Regierung von Oberbayern (or from the French Ministry of Agriculture). Peptides and proteins. Mouse MOG35 55 (MEVGWYRSPFSRVVHLYRNGK), mouse MOG38 50 (GWYRSPFSRVVHL), mouse NF-M18 30 (TETRSSFSRVSGS), mouse PLP139 151 (HSLGKWLGHPDKF), Ova323 339 (ISQAVHAAHAEINEAGR), mouse MOG90 110 (SDEGGYTCFFRDHSYQEEAA), rat MBP pC1 (MBP68 84) (HYGSLPQKSPRSQDENPV), guinea pig MBP pC2 (MBP45 67) (GSDRAAP KRGSGKDSHHAARTT) or guinea pig MBP p81 (MBP69 83) (YGSLPQKSQR SQDEN) were synthesized either by BioTrend or by the core facility of Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry. We obtained mouse NF-M225 237 (LQDEVA FLRSNHE) from Metabion. We puri ed the peptides by HPLC to 495% purity and analyzed them by mass spectrometry. We puri ed recombinant soluble rat MOG protein (MOG1 125)23, mouse full-length NF-L and mouse head domain fragment of NF-M (NF-M head ; NF-M1 102) (Supplementary Methods online) from bacterial inclusion bodies. We purchased S100b and ovalbumin from Sigma. We puri ed guinea pig MBP and rat MBP using standard protocols. Histology. We perfused mice with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and stored them in the same xative for 24 h. We stained adjacent serial sections of CNS and PNS with H&E, luxol fast blue or Bielschowsky silver impregnation. We also stained some sections with CD3-speci c (Serotec) and Mac3-speci c (BD Biosciences) antibodies. We stained adjacent sections with the respective isotype controls. Adoptive transfer EAE. For 2D2  Rag2 / T cell transfer, we puri ed CD4+ T cells from 2D2  Rag2 / mice and stimulated them in vitro with 20 mg ml 1 of NF-M15 35 peptide in the presence of 20 ng ml 1 IL-12 and 1 ng ml 1 IL-2 (both from R&D Systems) and irradiated syngeneic splenocytes. On day 6, we re-stimulated viable cells with splenocytes and 20 mg ml 1 of NF-M15 35 in the presence of 20 mg ml 1 IL-12 and 1 mg ml 1 IL-2. On day 9, we injected Ficoll-puri ed T helper type 1 cells into lightly irradiated (300 rad) syngeneic recipients. Myelin puri cation. We puri ed crude myelin from Mog / , WT C57BL/6 or Mog /  Nefm / CNS tissues according to previously published protocols9,10. Brie y, we pooled brain and spinal cord and homogenized it in 0.32 M sucrose in 10 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.4. Then we centrifuged at 15,000g and washed the pellet twice with 0.32 M sucrose solution. Finally, we suspended the pellet in 0.32 M sucrose and overlaid on to 0.85 M sucrose and centrifuged at 26,000g. We collected the myelin at the interface, washed it twice and suspended it in 1 ml of sterile PBS. Proliferation assay. For the analysis of fractions from biochemical separations, we mixed spleen cells from 2D2 or OT-II mice (2  105 cells) with LPS-activated BMDCs from WT C57BL/6 mice (5  104 cells) together with 1 in 50-diluted fractions. Unless otherwise mentioned, in all other T cell proliferation experiments, we cultured 2  105 spleen cells with 20 mg ml 1 peptides and proteins. We performed all proliferation assays in triplicate. We measured the T cell proliferation by the incorporation of 3H-labeled thymidine during the last 6 h of a 48-h culture or the last 16 h of a 72-h culture. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We assayed cell culture supernatants with antibody pairs or kits for IFN-g, IL-2 (both from BD Biosciences), TNF-a (Peprotech), IL-10 (R&D Systems) or IL-17 (eBioscience) according to the manufacturer s instructions. T cell lines. We established antigen-speci c T cell lines from C57BL/6 mice immunized with MOG35 55, NF-M15 35 or NF-M head in complete Freund s adjuvant supplemented with 5 mg ml 1 Mycobacterium tuberculosis (strain H37Ra) using established protocols. We collected spleen and draining lymph nodes 10 12 d after immunization and stimulated them with respective antigen at 20 mg ml 1. We supplemented T cell cultures with recombinant mouse IL-2 (Peprotech) and supernatant from concanavalin A stimulated mouse spleen cells on days 0, 3 and 5. We puri ed live T cells by Nycoprep gradient (Progen Biotechnik) and repeated stimulation every 7 10 d. Statistical analyses. We analyzed spontaneous EAE incidence by Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis, and we analyzed adoptive transfer EAE data and proliferation assays by analysis of variance. We used GraphPad Prism for all statistical analyses. We considered P values less than 0.05 to be signi cant. 22. Jacomy, H., Zhu, Q.Z., Couillard-Despres, S., Beaulieu, J.M. & Julien, J.P.
