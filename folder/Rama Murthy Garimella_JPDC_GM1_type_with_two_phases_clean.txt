On an exact solution of the rate matrix of G/M/1-type Markov process with small number of phases Rama Murthy Garimella International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad, India Rumyantsev Alexander Institute of Applied Mathematical Research of the Karelian Research Centre RAS; Petrozavodsk State University, Petrozavodsk, Russia Abstract In this research paper we consider the matrix polynomial equation arising naturally in the equilibrium analysis of a structured G/M/1-type Markov process. We obtain an explicit expression for the unknown rate matrix R being 2 2 matrix. The method is based on symbolic solution of the deter- minental polynomial equation. Using Cayley Hamilton theorem, the matrix polynomial equation for the matrix R is reduced to the system of linear equations.

Introduction Matrix analytic method continues to prove its applicability to a wide variety of models in the eld of modern computing and communication sys- tems. Extensively developed by M. Neuts in the celebrated work [1], the powerful method allows to study sophisticated objects: stability [2, 3] and performance [4] of stochastic model of a high-performance cluster, power management in datacenters [5], redundancy in high-performance systems [6], cloud computing [7], to name a few. The system under study is usually modelled as a continuous time Markov process {(X(t), Y (t)), t 0} with countable state space E := {(0, j), j = 1, . . . , m0; (i, j), i 1, j = 1, . . . , m}, where the phase variable Y (t) may take one of m (or m0 for boundary states) values and level variable X(t) may be increased/decreased at each transition. The state space E can be partitioned into levels with level n 1 being the subset {(n, j), j = 1, . . . , m} E. In many elds of interest, it is assumed that the level is increased by at most one, and decreased by at most N 1 (we focus on the case N < ) units at each transition epoch. These models belong to the so-called structured G/M/1- type Markov processes, extensively studied in [1], with the natural example of such a process being the queue length process, embedded at arrival epochs. 2 The in nitesimal generator matrix of a structured G/M/1-type process has the following block-multidiagonal representation Q = A0,0 A0,1 0 0 . . . A1,0 A1,1 A(0) 0 . . . A2,0 A(2) A(1) A(0) . . . A3,0 A(3) A(2) A(1) . . . ... ... ... ... ... 0 A(N+1) A(N) A(N 1) . . . 0 0 A(N+1) A(N) . . . ... ... ... ... ... , (1) where A(i), i = 0, . . . , N + 1 are square matrices of order m, satisfying the balance equation A1 = 0, where A := N+1 X i=0 A(i), (2) 1 (0) is the vector of ones (zeroes) of corresponding dimension, A0,0 is a square matrix of order m0 and Ai,0, A0,1 are possibly rectangular matrices. (Recall that for these type of processes the o -diagonal elements of matrix Q, i.e. the rates of transitions of the process, are nonnegative.) The key component of the method is to obtain the steady-state probability vector = ( i,j), i, j E of the system states in the level-wise matrix- geometric form [1] (for more details on the method see [8, 9]) k = k 1R, k 1, (3) where k = ( k,1, . . . , k,m) and the matrix R is the minimal nonnegative 3 solution of a matrix polynomial equation P(R) := N X i=0 RiA(i) = 0. (4) Thus, the analysis is essentially reduced to obtaining the matrix R. How- ever, in general, the rate matrix R is obtained by means of converging it- erative procedures [1, 10, 11] (see also the comparison of iterative proce- dures [12]), and, to the best of our knowledge, the explicit solution in general is available only for a number of special cases (in particular, when matrix A(0) is a rank-one matrix [13], or A(2) is a rank-one matrix in a system with N = 2 [10, 14], see also [15]). To avoid the numerical procedure of obtaining the matrix R, some alter- native methods are developed. The spectral decomposition-based methods were suggested in [16, 17] (which required eigenanalysis of a matrix polyno- mial), some of them utilizing special structure of the model to decrease the computational complexity [18]. In [19], the Spectral Analysis method based on Jordan canonical form is suggested to obtain a closed form analytic solu- tion of (4). In [20] an extensive study of the Jordan form representation of R (i.e computing eigenvalues and generalized eigenvectors of R) is performed, and the nite memory recursions are suggested to decrease memory require- ments of the algorythm. A more general discussion of Jordan canonical form method is provided in [21]. Alternatively, new method of steady-state anal- ysis and obtaining the closed form solution by nding the roots of some (complex-variable) polynomial is developed in [7]. A particular case of G/M/1 process with N = 2 is the so-called Quasi- Birth-Death (QBD) process, when the level variable is allowed to increase 4 or decrease by at most one at a time. In this case the matrix polynomial equation (4) is reduced to the matrix quadratic equation R2A(2) + RA(1) + A(0) = 0, (5) rst used to nd a solution of a QBD process (by means of Complex Analysis- based method) in late 60 s [22, 23]. Recently a method of obtaining explicit solution for the rate matrix R of a QBD process with a small number of phases was proposed [24], where, in particular, the 2 2 matrices A(0), A(2) may be of full rank (we also note a closely related work [25], where both 2 2 matrices were full rank, however, upper-triangular). In the present paper we extend the results of [24] to a more general structured G/M/1-type Markov process with N > 1 and two phases at a level. As an example application of the proposed solution, we elaborate on the new method of randomized switching for power saving ( rst proposed in [24]) which we feel may be implemented in Edge Computing systems based on Internet of Things devices. By numerical experiments, we investigate the optimal con guration of the switching parameters that minimize the aver- age energy consumption and guarantee the required quality of service. We note that the proposed randomized switching approach may be applied to systems, where cost e ectiveness and service elasticity is important, such as high-performance and cloud-based computing systems [26], as well as tele- tra c systems (e.g. on-demand content servers), where the operational cost (e.g. energy cost, or cloud service cost), as well as the system speed, is to be adopted to the working conditions. The approach is suitable for heavy load conditions, since the switching is performed autonomously, without any 5 knowledge on the system state, except the type of the current event. This research paper is organized as follows. First, we brie y describe the results of [24]. Then we present an algebraic approach on obtaining the matrix R. Next, we apply this approach to solve the optimization problem related to Energy-Performance tradeo , and illustrate the approach with simulation results. 2. Explicit Rate Matrix of a QBD Process with 2 Phases at a Level Below we brie y recall the results introduced in [24], where a QBD process (with N = 2) was considered. In this case, the rate matrix R is a solution of matrix quadratic equation (5). We assume that the Neuts ergodicity condition holds [9], := A(0)1/ A(2)1 < 1, (6) where the stochastic vector is the solution of the following system A = 0 1 = 1. (7) First, the following factorization lemma (proven by direct expansion of the r.h.s. of (8) and substitution of (5)) holds true [27, 20]: Lemma 1. The polynomial matrix A( ) := A(0) + A(1) + 2A(2) allows the following factorization: A( ) ( I R)( A(2) + RA(2) + A(1)). (8) 6 Then, the determinantal polynomial det A( ) is constructed, and it is easy to see that the polynomial is of degree four. Note also that = 1 is always root of det A( ) by the balance condition (2). Rewrite det A( )/( 1) = a3 3 + a2 2 + a1 + a0. (9) Denote by i, i = 1, 2, 3 the zeroes of the polynomial (9). It follows from Lemma 1 that det A( ) = det( I R) det( A(2) + RA(2) + A(1)). Thus, the eigenvalues of R are zeroes of the determinantal polynomial det A( ). Note that there are exactly m = 2 zeroes (denote them 1, 2) of the determinantal polynomial det A( ) which are strictly inside unit circle and these are the eigenvalues of R (provided := sp(R) < 1), see e.g. [20]. Hence the zeroes of det( A(2) + RA(2) + A(1)) are outside the unit circle. Consider now the characteristic polynomial of the matrix R in a monic form det( I R) = ( 1)( 2) = 2 + b1 + b0, (10) where b0 = 1 2 = det R, b1 = ( 1 + 2) = Trace(R) are (real) scalars, since R is a nonnegative matrix. By Perron Frobenius theorem, = sp(R) is simple, real eigenvalue, and (0, 1), provided (6) holds. W.o.l.o.g. let 1 = . Then 2 is also real, which makes 3 also real. Given that, it is easy to obtain b1 = a2 a3 + 3, (11) b0 = a0 a3 3 . (12) The value 3 (which is the real zero outside the unit disk) is obtained fol- lowing the celebrated trigonometric solution of the cubic equation (9) by the 7 following substitutions: p = 3a3a1 a2 2 9a2 3 , q = 2a3 2 9a3a2a1 + 27a2 3a4 27a3 3 . (13) Then [28] 3 = a2 3a3 + 2 p cos 1 3 cos 1  q 2p p  . (14) By Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain R2 = b1R b0I, (15) which, by substitution into (5), leads to the following system of linear equa- tions: R  A(1) b1A(2) b0A(2) + A(0) = 0. (16) Thus, if A(1) b1A(2) is invertible, then R =  b0A(2) A(0)  A(1) b1A(2) 1 . (17) It remains to note that the invertibility of A(1) b1A(2) was proven by diagonal dominance. We nalize the section with a procedure to obtain the rate matrix R in an explicit form. Step 1. Obtain the maximal eigenvalue 3 by (14). Step 2. Obtain b1 by (11) and b0 by (12). Step 3. Obtain R by (17). It remains to note that the initial vectors 0, 1 are obtained by the following linear system of equations ( 0, 1) A0,0 A0,1 A1,0 A1,1 + RA(2) = 0, (18) 01 + 1(I R) 11 = 1. (19) 8 3. Explicit Rate Matrix of a G/M/1-type Process with 2 Phases at a Level We are interested in matrix polynomial equation (4), provided the stabil- ity condition holds [1] A(0)1 < N X k=2 (k 1)A(k)1, (20) where, recall, the stochastic vector is the solution of the system (7). We de ne the corresponding generator function G( ) = N X i=0 iA(i), and it is easy to show that G( ) = ( I R)J( , R), (21) where J( , R) := N 1 X i=0 iEi, (22) and Ei = N X j=i+1 Rj i 1A(j). The derivation of (21) follows the Residual Theorem [20]. Following Cayley Hamilton theorem, if the matrix R is 2 2 matrix, then R2 = ( + )R I, (23) where > are the distinct real eigenvalues of R (recall also that = sp(R)). Thus, if we de ne the (column) vector a1 b1 := 1 0 , 9 then from (23) by induction it is easy to obtain Rj = ajR + bjI, (24) where the values aj, bj are de ned recursively by the following linear trans- form aj bj = + 1 0 aj 1 bj 1 , j 2. (25) Thus, returning back to the polynomial equation, we obtain that P(R) is equivalent to a linear polynomial P(R) = R N X j=1 ajA(j) + n X j=2 bjA(j) + A(0). (26) It follows that the matrix R may be obtained as a solution of the linear equation P(R) = 0. However, to obtain the solution, we may need to de ne the coe cients explicitly. This is done in the following Theorem. Theorem 1. The coe cients in (26) are as follows aj = j 1 X i=0 i j i 1, (27) bj = j 1 X i=1 i j i. (28) Proof: Indeed, for j = 1 the equalities (27), (28) hold (with convention b1 = 0), and it is straightforward to check from (25) that they hold for j = 2, with a2 = + , b2 = . Now we consider that (27) holds for j k 1 and prove the induction step. Indeed, k 1 X i=0 i k i 1 = k 2 X i=0 i k i 2 + k 1 = ak 1 + k 1. (29) 10 However, by (25), ak = ( + )ak 1 + bk 1 = ( + )ak 1 ak 2 = ak 1 + (ak 1 ak 2). Thus, showing that the l.h.s. of (29) equals ak is equivalent to showing that k 2 equals ak 1 ak 2. Indeed, by induction, ak 1 ak 2 = k 2 X i=0 i k i 2 k 3 X i=0 i k i 3 = = k 2 X i=0 i k i 2 k 3 X i=0 i k i 2 = k 2. The result (28) follows directly from (25), since bj = aj 1. This completes the proof. Remark 1. Note that (27) originates in the following proposition: J( , I) = N X j=1 ajA(j). Indeed, it follows from (22) that J( , I) = N 1 X i=1 i N X j=1 j i 1A(j) = N X j=1 A(j) j 1 X i=0 i j i 1, (30) where the last equation follows by changing the order of sums. We note that the equations (10) (14) hold true, since the localization of the eigenvalues , inside the unit disk, and 3 outside the unit disk is valid, 11 as proven in [21]. Thus, we only need to change the equation (17) w.r.t. (26) and (30) as follows R = n X j=2 bjA(j) + A(0) ! [J( , I)] 1 . (31) It remains to show that J( , I) is invertible, which we do by the following lemma, generalizing the corresponding result in [24]. Lemma 2. The matrix J( , I) is invertible. Proof: It was shown in [21] that J( , R) is nonsingular and diagonally dominant for arbitrary (complex) : | | < 1. In particular, it follows that J( , R) is a diagonally dominant matrix. Note that by the properties of the generator matrix Q, only the diagonal elements of matrix A(1) are nonposi- tive, while other matrices are nonnegative. It follows from (22) that J( , R) = A(1) + N X j=2 Rj 1A(j) + N 1 X i=1 iEi, where Ei, i 1 do not contain the matrix A(1). Then the diagonal dominance guarantees that |A(1) i,i | > " N X j=2 Rj 1A(j) + N 1 X i=1 iEi # + m X j=1,j =i A(1) i,j , (32) Since the eigenvalues are distinct, then R is diagonalizable, hence R has a spectral representation [21] R = U1 + U2, (33) where U1, U2 are the so-called residue matrices, with U1 + U2 = I. Note that by Perron Frobenius theorem, U1 0 componentwise [10], which provides a 12 componentwise inequality R U1 + U2 = I. (34) Note that since the matrices A(j), j 2 as well as Ei, i 1 are nonnega- tive, then replacement of the matrix R by I in (32) keeps the inequality. Thus, the matrix J( , I) is strictly diagonally dominant matrix and hence is nonsingular. Thus, the corresponding algorithm to obtain the explicit solution for the rate matrix R of a G/M/1-type Markov process is as follows. Step 1. Obtain the maximal eigenvalue 3 by (14). Step 2. Obtain b1 by (11) and b0 by (12). Step 3. Obtain R by (31). It remains to note that the initial vectors 0, 1 are obtained by the following linear system of equations following from [13] and (24) ( 0, 1) A0,0 A0,1 PN j=1(aj 1R + bj 1I)Aj,0 A1,1 + PN j=1(ajR + bjI)A(j+1) = 0, with normalizing condition 01 + 1(I R) 11 = 1. 4. Random Switching for Energy E ciency In this section we elaborate more on the novel method of energy e ciency improvement by randomized switching of low and high power consuming regimes, presented in [24]. This method is a randomized extension of the well- known power throttling method used in high-performance and distributed 13 computing [29, 30]. We brie y recall the system under study. Consider a queueing system with a renewal input ow of customers arriving into an (unbounded) First-Come-First-Served queue. The i.i.d. interarrival times are exponentially distributed with rate > 0. Each customer requires an exponentially distributed (with unit rate) amount of work to be done (say, information to be transmitted). The single server operates two speed modes (call them high and low), with rates 2 > 1 > 0. The server may switch the speed only at the arrival/departure epochs (asynchronously). Denote c0 < c1 < c2 the energy consumption per unit time in idle (no customers in the system)/low/high modes. In order to preserve energy, the server implements the following random switching policy: at the task arrival epoch, given the current mode is low, switch to high mode with probability (w.p.) p1, or remain low w.p. 1 p1; at the task departure epoch, given the current mode is high, switch to low mode w.p. p2, or remain high w.p. 1 p2. Let (t) {0, 1 . . . } be the number of customers, and m(t) {1, 2} be the mode of the system at time t 0. Then the following Markov process {( (t), m(t)) {0, 1, . . . } {1, 2}, t 0} (35) is a continuous-time QBD process, with (t) being the level, and m(t) being the phase at time t. The in nitesimal generator matrix of the process (35) has the form (1), 14 where we de ne the matrices explicitly: A(0) = (1 p1) p1 0 , (36) A(1) = 1 0 0 2 , (37) A(2) = 1 0 p2 2 (1 p2) 2 , (38) A0,0 = I, A0,1 = A(0), (39) A1,1 = A(1), A1,0 = A(2). (40) The stability criterion of the process (35), established in [24], is as follows p1( 2) + 2p2( 1) < 0. (41) Intuitively, the condition (41) indicates a negative drift of the service process of the system under heavy load, with respect to the mode switching intensity. Note that p1 = 1 and p2 = 0 corresponds to a classical M/M/1 service system working at the speed 2 (referred below as classical system). Let E 0 be the average number of customers, and EE0 be the average energy consumption per unit time in the classical system in stationary regime. It can be readily seen that E 0 = 1 , (42) EE0 = c0(1 ) + c2 , (43) where, recall, 1 is the stationary idle probability of the classical system (for details on the aforementioned classical results see [31]). We may consider E 0 as the QoS parameter of the classical system. 15 Now we turn to the original two-mode system, i.e. we consider the non- trivial case p1, p2 > 0. Provided (41) holds, we de ne the matrix R following the steps of the suggested procedure of exact computation, where the coe - cients in the polynomial (9) are obtained as follows: a3 = 1 2(1 p2), a2 = 1( + 2) 2(1 p2), a1 = ( + 1) + 2(1 p1), a0 = 2(1 p1). After obtaining R from the equation (17), the equations (3) (19) provide the stationary system state probabilities. Straightforward manipulation leads to the following system for 1: 1   1 A(2) R 1 A(0)1 = 0, 1   1 A(2) + (I R) 1 1 = 1. (44) Then the value 0 is obtained as follows: 0 = 1 1A(2). (45) The obtained solution allows to evaluate the average number of customers in the system as the QoS measure: E p1,p2 = 1(I R) 21, (46) where by notation p1,p2 we stress the dependence on the mode switching probabilities. The average energy consumption may be obtained as follows: EEp1,p2 = 0c01 + 1(I R) 1(c1, c2)T, (47) 16 where the transposed vector (c1, c2) is the column-vector of energy consump- tion in each mode. Then the following optimization problem can be solved: minimization of the average energy consumption in stationary regime, pro- vided the controlled QoS decrease: min p1,p2>0 EEp1,p2, s.t. E p1,p2 (1 + )E 0, (48) for some > 0. By numerical experiment we study the dependence of optimal regime switching strategy (p1, p2) on the intensity of arrivals . We set 1 = 1/2.8, 2 = 1/1.3, c0 = 2300, c1 = 3200, c2 = 5400, which correspond to the frequencies and (roughly measured) power con- sumption of a single-CPU laptop we used as a testbed. Then, we vary = 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 such that at rst the system is stable at lower frequency, but with increasing the low-frequency regime becomes unstable. Following the procedure of obtaining the exact solution, we numerically solve the optimization problem (48) and obtain approximate optimal values p1, p2, as well as approximate optimal energy consumption. We vary the QoS degradation 1 + (1.1, 30) and plot the obtained values. We perform simulation with R language [32]. It is easy to see from Fig. 1 that, as expected, if the low regime is stable ( = 0.3), the system tends to an M/M/1 system working at low speed, with the appropriate growth of QoS degradation. When the low regime becomes 17 unstable ( 0.4), the system is forced to switch to high regime so as to guarantee stability, however, it still is (starting from some tolerated QoS decrease) switching to the low regime at each departure (p2 1). With an increasing input rate, the switching to lower regime at departures becomes less probable (p2 < 1). Finally, when the system in a high regime becomes heavily loaded ( = 0.6), the optimal strategy is such that switching to low regime at departures becomes less probable, than switching to high regime at arrivals. 5. Conclusion We have presented the algebraic approach for obtaining the rate matrix R of the structured G/M/1-type process explicitly, when the process has only two phases at each level. Note that, albeit being simplistic, such a process may be used to model quite a number of recent applications, such as the mod- ern communication devices, Internet of Things devices, high-performance and cloud-based servers (where processors use the Dynamic Voltage and Fre- quency Scaling technology), telecommunications (with two types of service high and low priority customers [33]). In such elds of application, it is cru- cial to have an easy and asynchronous (to guarantee robustness at high loads) scheme for optimizing the cost (e.g. average energy consumption per unit time). We proposed such a randomized scheme which may be implemented e.g. in the Edge Computing systems based on Internet of Things to optimize the cost under controlled QoS degradation, when possible, and evaluated it in a numerical experiment. We leave the extended eld test of the proposed scheme for future research. 18 0 20 40 60 80 100 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 = 0.3 Switching probability p1 p2 0 20 40 60 80 100 3060 3080 = 0.3 Stationary power consumption 0 20 40 60 80 100 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 = 0.4 Switching probability p1 p2 0 20 40 60 80 100 3450 3550 = 0.4 Stationary power consumption 0 20 40 60 80 100 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 = 0.5 Switching probability p1 p2 0 20 40 60 80 100 4000 4100 = 0.5 Stationary power consumption 0 20 40 60 80 100 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 = 0.6 QoS degradation Switching probability p1 p2 0 20 40 60 80 100 4500 4600 4700 = 0.6 QoS degradation Stationary power consumption Figure 1: Switching probability vs. QoS degradation (left); average power consumption per unit time vs. QoS degradation (right) in a system for various input rate . 19 Note that the proposed randomized energy e ciency management scheme may be extended to multiserver models, which may be relevant to web servers working under heavy and/or bursty load. However, in this case analytical solution for the rate matrix R is not available, and numerical methods should be applied. When working with systems of large scale, the state space of the system dramatically increases, which motivates the need to apply High- Performance Computing for system performance evaluation. 6.
