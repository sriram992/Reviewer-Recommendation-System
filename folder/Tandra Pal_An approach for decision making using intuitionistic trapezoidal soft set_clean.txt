Das, M. B. Kar, S. Kar, T. Pal Received 10 March 2018; Revised 5 April 2018; Accepted 11 May 2018 Abstract. Introduction of soft sets by Molodtsov (1999) has evolved a revolution in the decision making paradigm. Researchers have used soft sets with di erent extensions of fuzzy sets to satisfy the various types of uncertainties involved with real life decision making problems. This paper introduces intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy soft set (ITrFSS) by combining intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set (ITrFS) with soft set. Firstly, we gener- alize the adjustable approach applied to intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) based decision making developed by Jiang et al. (2011) and then present an approach to ITrFSS based decision making using threshold ITrFSs and level soft sets. Moreover, we propose weighted ITrFSS and apply it in a decision making problem. Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) has been used to derive the attribute weights. This paper has also validated the outcome of the adjustable approaches based on ITrFSS and weighted ITrFSS using closeness coe cient measure. Finally, two illustrative exam- ples are provided to show the feasibility of the proposed approaches in real life decision making problems. 2010 AMS Classi cation: 03E72, 04A72, 18B05 Keywords: Intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy soft set, intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set, level soft set, decision making.

To deal with it, Molodtsov [28] introduced soft set as a generic mathematical tool. Soft set uses two important ideas which are pa- rameterization and approximate description on the set of objects. Due to having these properties, applicability of soft sets to real life problems have been emerging rapidly. To deal with the inexact and incomplete uncertain realistic problems, Maji S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 et al. [22] combined soft set with fuzzy set and introduced fuzzy soft set (FSS). Since its introduction, FSS theory has been successfully applied in many di erent elds such as decision making, data analysis, forecasting, simulation, optimization, texture classi cation, etc. Intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) was introduced by Maji et al. [23, 24] as a generalization of FSS. Due to its inherent capability to represent human thought, IFSS has been widely used by many researches and practitioners to solve various real life decision making problems. The suitability of IFSS for the decision making applications has been explained in [21]. Various operations, properties and algebraic structure of IFSSs are studied in [45]. Some signi cant contributions on decision making based on IFSS are narrated below. Jiang et al. [20] investigated entropy and distance measurements on IFSSs. Zhang [39] proposed a new rough set model and applied it in IFSS based decision making problems. Das and Kar [7] proposed an algorithmic approach for decision making using IFSS, where the authors used cardinals of IFSS as a novel concept. Feng et al. [18] pointed out some limitations of the method proposed by Roy and Maji [31]. In order to overcome those limitations, they introduced an adjustable approach in [18] for FSSs based decision making using level soft sets. In the proposed adjustable approaches, the authors considered di erent types of thresholds and consequently di erent level soft sets. As a more generalized version of the method presented in [18], Jiang et al. [19] proposed an adjustable approach to IFSSs based decision making problem using the concept of level soft sets. The authors also extended the adjustable approach based on weighted IFSS. Qin et al. [30] further generalized the approaches introduced by Feng et al. [18] and Jiang et al. [19]. They developed the notion of reduct IFSS and presented an adjustable approach to interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IVIFSS) based decision making by using reduct IFSSs and level soft sets. Zhang et al. [40] also developed an adjustable approach for decision making based on IVIFSSs by using level soft sets. They further de ned the concept of weighted IVIFSS and applied it to decision making environment. Das et al. [8, 9] proposed two decision making approaches using IVIFSS. Trapezoidal fuzzy soft set was introduced by Xiao et al [41]. During the last decade, the study on hybrid models combining FSS and other mathematical concepts have become much popular among the researchers and many researchers have contributed to this domain. Recently, Das et al. [13] have studied the evolutions of FSS and its extensions and extensively reviewed their applications in decision making problems. Tang [33] have proposed a novel FSS based approach using grey relational analysis (GRA) and Dempster OC oShafer theory of evidence, where GRA is used to determine the uncertain degree of various parameters and Dempster OC oShafer theory is used for aggregation purpose. Muthukumar et al. [29] proposed a new similarity measure on IFSSs which minimized the in uence of imprecise parameters and discussed some of their basic properties. Alcantud [2] in- vestigated the FSS based decision making approaches given by Roy and Maji [31] and Feng et al. [18]. The author further suggested that the methodology given in [18] can be explored to have more bene ts. In their proposed approach, the author [31] aggregated the data coming from multi-sources into a resultant FSS using a more ac- curate operator. Wang et al. [34] used ambiguity measure and Dempster OC oShafer 100 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 theory of evidence to propose an improved decision making approach based on FSS. The authors rstly used ambiguity measure to obtain the uncertainty degree of each parameter and then used Dempster OC Os combination rule to rank the alternatives. Triangular fuzzy soft set (TFSS) was introduced in [11]. Dutta and Limboo [17] introduced Bell shaped FSS and applied it in medical diagnosis problem. Aiwu and Hongjun [1] proposed fuzzy linguistic soft set (FLSS) by combining fuzzy set, linguis- tic variable and soft set. Dey and Pal [15] introduced generalised multi-fuzzy soft set (GMFSS) and studied their various operations and properties. Finally they applied GMFSS in decision making problems. Intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft set the- ory was de ned by Deli and Cagman [14]. The authors also presented as adjustable approach for decision making based on intuitionistic fuzzy parameterized soft set. In [3], Alcantud extensively studied the underlying relationships among fuzzy sets, soft sets, and their extensions. Das et al. [12] proposed correlation coe cient of hesitant fuzzy soft set (HFSS) and using it they developed correlation e ciency. The au- thors presented a decision making algorithm using the proposed concept. They also proposed correlation coe cient in the framework of interval-valued hesitant fuzzy soft set (IVHFSS). In [6], Das et al. proposed a novel approach to estimate the missing or unknown information in incomplete fuzzy soft sets (FSSs). Then they generalized their approach to nd missing or unknown information in the context of interval valued fuzzy soft sets. In [10], Das et al. studied an algorithmic approach for group decision making (GDM) problems using neutrosophic soft matrix (NSM) and relative weights of experts. They considered NSM as the matrix representation of neutrosophic soft sets (NSSs), where NSS is the combination of neutrosophic set and soft set. An object is described in fuzzy set using only the membership grade and fuzzy set considers that the sum of membership and non-membership grade is 1. But in real life, this sum may be less than 1. Intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) [4] solved this kind of problem by incorporating an additional parameter called hesitance margin. This hesitancy parameter makes IFS signi cant to solve the uncertain real life problems. Intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set (ITrFS) was introduced by Wang and Zhang [35] as a generalization of IFS [4]. In ITrFS, the membership and non-membership functions are expressed using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. The membership and non- membership functions of an intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number are piecewise linear and trapezoidal, which can e ectively transform the linguistic terms into nu- merical variables. So ITrFS is considered to be more useful to express the uncertain situations. Recently many researchers have contributed on ITrFSs based decision making. Ye [43, 44] investigated the similarity measures and distance based simi- larity measures between ITrFNs and applied to decision making problems. Ye [42] also studied expected value method for intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set based de- cision making. Du and Liu [16] extended fuzzy VIKOR method with ITrFNs. Wei et al. [38] proposed grey relational analysis (GRA) model for selecting an enter- prise resource planning (ERP) system in trapezoidal intuitionistic fuzzy setting. Yu [46] introduced generalized intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy weighted averaging oper- ator (GITFWA) and studied its various properties. Saaty [32] introduced analytic hierarchy process (AHP), which has been successfully applied in decision making 101 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 problems. To include imprecise judgement, researchers used fuzzy AHP [5], where priority vectors are derived from the fuzzy pair wise comparison matrices. To de- rive weights from fuzzy comparison matrices, Mikhailov [25, 26, 27] proposed fuzzy preference programming (FPP) method. Wang and Chin [37] proposed a priority method utilizing a linear goal programming (LGP) model to derive normalized fuzzy weights from the fuzzy pair wise comparison matrices. As stated above, adjustable approach has drawn the attention of many researchers due to its exible nature on decision making paradigm. Initially adjustable approach was applied on FSS, then gradually it was extended to IFSS and IVIFSS. Similarly ITrFS has also many signi cant contributions to handle the uncertainties. However, none has concentrated on the extension of ITrFS with soft set to explore ITrFSS. The signi cance of ITrFSS on decision making problems is inevitable due to its ability of parameterization and representation of the linguistic information in more practi- cal and realistic manner. ITrFSS based adjustable approaches can solve the prob- lems where both the membership and non-membership functions are expressed using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. As we have observed, researchers have considered simply membership and non-membership functions to propose adjustable approaches, but none has used trapezoidal membership and non-membership functions to implement adjustable approaches. Some complex situations in our real life may require trape- zoidal representations of both the membership and non-membership functions, the concepts of level soft sets, as well as the concept of parameterizations to solve the problems. Hence the need of ITrFSS based adjustable approaches are signi cant. The purpose of this paper is to present an adjustable approach to solve real life de- cision making problems using ITrFSSs and weighted ITrFSSs. Firstly, we introduce the concept of ITrFSS by combining intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set and soft set. Then some threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy sets are introduced, which are used to compute the level soft sets of the ITrFSS. This study has presented an ad- justable approach for decision making using ITrFSSs and level soft sets, which may be considered as a generalized approach of the methods introduced by Feng et al. [18] and Jiang et al. [19]. We have also introduced weighted ITrFSS, where weights of the attributes are derived using fuzzy AHP [5]. Then the weighted ITrFSS has been ap- plied in decision making problems based on threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy sets and level soft sets. Finally, we have used a closeness coe cient measure [41] to validate the adjustable approaches which are based on ITrFSS and weighted ITrFSS. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brie y presents some relevant concepts including soft sets, fuzzy soft sets, intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets, and intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers. In section 3, we introduce ITrFSS, some threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy sets, and present an adjustable approach for decision making using ITrFSSs. Section 4 contains weighted ITrFSS based decision making followed by an illustrative example and validation of results using closeness coe cient. Comparative study is given in Section 5. Finally conclusions are drawn in section 6. 102 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 Table 1.

Preliminaries This section brie y presents some basic ideas relevant with this paper. Let U be the initial universe and E be the set of parameters. De nition 2.1 ([28]). Let P(U) denotes the power set of U and A E. A pair (F{A}, E) is called a soft set over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by F{A} : E P(U) such that F{A}(e) = if e / A. For any parameter e A, F{A}(e) may be considered as the set of e-approximate elements of the soft set (F{A}, E). Example 2.2. Let U be the set of ve diseases (Viral fever, Malaria, Typhoid, Gastric ulcer, Pneumonia) given by: U = {d1, d2, d3, d4, d5} and E be the set of ve symptoms given by: E = {Temperature, Headache, Stomachpain, Cough, Chestpain} = {s1, s2, s3, s4, s5}. Let A = {s1, s2, s3} E. Now consider that F{A} is a mapping given by: F{A}(s1) = {d1, d2, d3, d4}, F{A}(s2) = {d2, d3, d4}, F{A}(s3) = {d1, d2, d3}, F{A}(s4) = {d1, d2, d3, d4}. Then the soft set (F{A}, E) can be represented as follows: (F{A}, E) = {(s1, {d1, d2, d3, d4}), (s2, {d2, d3, d4}), (s3, {d1, d2, d3}), (s4, {d1, d2, d3, d4}), (s5, { })}. De nition 2.3 ([22]). Let FS(U) denotes the set of all fuzzy subsets of U and A E. A pair ( F{A}, E) is called a fuzzy soft set (FSS) over U, where F{A} is a mapping F{A} : E FS(U) Example 2.4. Consider the previous Example 2.2. If one considers that the asso- ciation of symptom s1 with the disease d1 is more important, then this information cannot be expressed simply with 0 and 1. Such type of situation can be well expressed using a membership value in [0, 1] instead of the crisp numbers 0 or 1. Assume that: F{A}(s1) = {d1/0.2, d2/0.4, d3/0.9, d4/0.7}, F{A}(s2) = {d2/0.8, d3/0.1, d4/0.7}, F{A}(s3) = {d1/0.6, d2/0.2, d3/0.8}, F{A}(s5) = {d1/0.6, d2/0.7, d3/0.5, d4/0.8}. Then the tabular representation of the FSS ( F{A}, E) is shown in Table 1. De nition 2.5. [23] Let IFS(U) denotes the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy subsets of U and A E. A pair ( F{A}, E) is called an intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by F{A} : E IFS(U). 103 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math.

Consider Example 2.4. When one hesitates to nd out the associa- tion of symptom s1 with the disease then this information cannot be expressed using only the membership grade. Both membership and non membership values can be considered in this kind of situation. Let us take F{A}(s1) = {d1/(0.2, 0.5), d2/(0.4, 0.3), d3/(0.9, 0.1), d4/(0.7, 0.2)}, F{A}(s2) = {d2/(0.8, 0.2), d3/(0.1, 0.8), d4/(0.7, 0.2)}, F{A}(s3) = {d1/(0.6, 0.3), d2/(0.2, 0.6), d3/(0.8, 0.1)}, F{A}(s5) = {d1/(0.6, 0.1), d2/(0.7, 0.2), d3/(0.5, 0.2), d4/(0.8, 0.2)}. Then the tabular representation of the IFSS ( F{A}, E) is shown in Table 2. De nition 2.7 ([4]). The membership and non-membership functions of an intu- itionistic trapezoidal fuzzy number (ITrFN) a are respectively de ned as: a(x) = x a b a a a x < b a b x c d x d c a c < x d 0, otherwise and its non-membership function is de ned as: a(x) = b x + a(x a1) b a1 a a1 x < b a b x c x c + a(d1 x) d1 c a, c < x d1 0 otherwise. Here 0 a 1, 0 a 1 and a + a 1, a, b, c, d, a1, d1 . a = ([a, b, c, d] : a) , ([a1, b, c, d1] : a) is called an ITrFN. For convenience, ITrFN a is written as a = ([a, b, c, d]; a, a). Let 1 = ([a1, b1, c1, d1]; 1, 1) and 2 = ([a2, b2, c2, d2]; 2, 2) be two ITrFNs and 0. Then following operations are de ned on 1 and 2: (i) 1 2 = ([a1 + a2, b1 + b2, c1 + c2, d1 + d2]; 1 + 2 1 2, 1 2), (ii) 1 2 = ([a1a2, b1b2, c1c2, d1d2]; 1 2, 1 + 2 1 2), (iii) 1 =  [ a, b, c, d]; 1 (1 1) , 1  , (v) 1 =  [a , b , c , d ]; 1, 1 (1 1)  . 104 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 In order to compare any two ITrFNs, Wang and Zhang [35] de ned the score function, accuracy function, and expected value as given below. De nition 2.8 ([35]). Let i = ([ai, bi, ci, di]; i, i) be an ITrFN. Score and accuracy functions of acute are respectively de ned by: S( ) = I( ) ( ) and H( ) = I( ) ( + ), where I( ) = 1 8 [(a + b + c + d) (1 + )] is the expected value of the ITrFN alpha. In order to compare two ITrFNs 1 = ([a1, b1, c1, d1]; 1, 1) and 2 = ([a2, b2, c2, d2]; 2, 2), the score and accuracy functions are used as follows: (i) if S( 1) > S( 2), then 1 > 2, (ii) suppose S( 1) = S( 2), then (a) if H( 1) > H( 2), then 1 > 2, (b) if H( 1) = H( 2), then 1 = 2. Distance between two fuzzy sets is a useful measure for calculating the di erence between them. The Hamming and Euclidean distances between two intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are given below. De nition 2.9 ([36]). Normalized Hamming distance between two ITrFNs 1 = ([a1, b1, c1, d1]; 1, 1) and 2 = ([a2, b2, c2, d2]; 2, 2) is de ned as: DH( 1, 2) = 1 8 |(1 + 1 1) a1 (1 + 2 2) a2| + |(1 + 1 1) b1 (1 + 2 2) b2| + |(1 + 1 1) c1 (1 + 2 2) c2| + |(1 + 1 1) d1 (1 + 2 2) d2| . De nition 2.10 ([36]). Normalized Euclidean distance between two ITrFNs 1 = ([a1, b1, c1, d1]; 1, 1) and 2 = ([a2, b2, c2, d2]; 2, 2) is de ned as: DE( 1, 2) = v u u u u u u t 1 8 {(1 + 1 1) a1 (1 + 2 2) a2}2 + {(1 + 1 1) b1 (1 + 2 2) b2}2 + {(1 + 1 1) c1 (1 + 2 2) c2}2 + {(1 + 1 1) d1 (1 + 2 2) d2}2 . Example 2.11. Let 1 = ([0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9]; 0, 6, 0.3) and 2 = ([0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]; 0.5, 0.3) be two ITrFNs. The normalized Hamming distance DH( 1, 2) and Euclidean dis- tance DE( 1, 2) measurements between two ITrFNs 1 and 2 are given below: DH( 1, 2) = 1 8 |(1 + 0.6 0.3) 0.5 (1 + 0.5 0.3) 0.4| + |(1 + 0.6 0.3) 0.6 (1 + 0.5 0.3) 0.5| + |(1 + 0.6 0.3) 0.7 (1 + 0.5 0.3) 0.6| + |(1 + 0.6 0.3) 0.9 (1 + 0.5 0.3) 0.7| = 0.11, 105 S.

Adjustable approach to ITrFSS based decision making In this section, we present an adjustable approach for decision making based on ITrFSS, which extends the methods introduced by Feng et al. [18] and Jiang et al. [19]. Firstly, we introduce ITrFSS, which is de ned as a combination of intuition- istic trapezoidal fuzzy set (ITrFS) and soft set. Then we propose various threshold ITrFSs, such as mid-level threshold ITrFS, top-level threshold ITrFS, and bottom- level threshold ITrFS. These threshold ITrFSs are necessary to adjust the decision makers judgements based on the decision environment and have signi cant contri- bution in decision making under various circumstances. This section also presents positive ideal and negative ideal ITrFNs, and closeness coe cient of alternatives. De nition 3.1. Let P(U) be the set of all intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy subsets of U, E be the set of parameters and A E. A pair ( F{A}, E) is called intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy soft set (ITrFSS) over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by F{A} : E P(U). In other words, ITrFSS is a parameterized family of intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy subsets of U. For any parameter e A, F{A}(e) is considered as the intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy value set for the parameter e. Example 3.2. Let us consider Example 2.6 mentioned earlier. ITrFN supports piecewise linear and trapezoidal representation of the intuitionistic fuzzy values. When a decision maker expresses his/her opinion in linguistic terms, ITrFN is con- sidered to be suitable for numerical conversion of those linguistic terms. For sim- plicity, here we take numerical values to present the association of the diseases with each of the symptoms. ITrFN a = ([a, b, c, d]; a, a) , a, b, c, d, a, a is used to present the association. Let us take F{A}(s1) = {d1/(0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)(0.2, 0.5), d2/(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)(0.4, 0.3), d3/(0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9)(0.9, 0.1), d4/(0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8)(0.7, 0.2)} F{A}(s2) = {d2/(0.4, 0.5, 0.5, 0.6)(0.8, 0.2), d3/(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6)(0.1, 0.8), d4/(0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4)(0.7, 0.2)} F{A}(s3) = {d1/(0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3)(0.6, 0.3), d2/(0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6)(0.2, 0.6), d3/(0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9)(0.8, 0.1)} F{A}(s5) = {d1/(0.5, 0.6, 0.6, 0.7)(0.6, 0.1), d2/(0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7)(0.7, 0.2), d3/(0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4)(0.5, 0.2), d4/(0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5)(0.8, 0.2)}. 106 S.

Let z = ( F{A}, E) be an ITrFSS over U and A E, Let z = ([a, b, c, d]; z, z) be an ITrFN for the ITrFSS ( F{A}, E). These notations are used in all of the following de nitions. De nition 3.3. For any ITrFN c = ([c1, c2, c3, c4]; c, c) the c-level soft set of ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is a crisp soft set L(z, c) =  F{A}( ), c  which is de ned below. L  F{A}( ); c  = {x U| z > c} , A. The ITrFN c = ([c1, c2, c3, c4]; c, c) is considered as threshold ITrFN, which is chosen by the decision maker in advance for the real life decision making problems based on ITrFSS. De nition 3.4. The mid-level intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set (ITrFS) mid z for the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is de ned as: for each A, [amid z( ) = 1 |U| X x U a F{A}( )(x), bmid z( ) = 1 |U| X x U b F{A}( )(x), cmid z( ) = 1 |U| X x U c F{A}( )(x), dmid z( ) = 1 |U| X x U d F{A}( )(x)], [ mid z( ) = 1 |U| X x U F{A}( )(x), mid z( ) = 1 |U| X x U F{A}( )(x)]. The mid-level ITrFS mid z is denoted as mid-level threshold for the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E). The level soft set of ITrFSS z concerned with the mid-level thresh- old mid z is called the mid-level soft set of z denoted by L( z; mid z) The mid-level threshold ITrFS is useful in those uncertain decision making problems, where the expert/decision maker takes a decision giving more focus on the average opinions. De nition 3.5. Top-level threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set top z of the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is de ned by: for each A, [atoptop z( ) = max x U a F{A}( )(x), btoptop z( ) = max x U b F{A}( )(x), ctoptop z( ) = max x U c F{A}( )(x), dtoptop z( ) = max x U d F{A}( )(x)], [ toptop z( ) = max x U F{A}( )(x), toptop z( ) = min x U F{A}( )(x)]. The level soft set of ITrFSS z regarding the top-level threshold top z is called the top- level soft set of z and denoted by L( z; top z). This top-level soft set can be considered 107 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 in those decision making problems, where the decision maker mostly considers the higher ITrFNs, i.e., the better opinions. De nition 3.6. Bottom level threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set bottom z of the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is de ned by: for each A, [abottom z( ) = min x U a F{A}( )(x), bbottom z( ) = min x U b F{A}( )(x), cbottom z( ) = min x U c F{A}( )(x), dbottom z( ) = min x U d F{A}( )(x)], [ bottom z( ) = min x U F{A}( )(x), bottom z( ) = max x U F{A}( )(x)]. The level soft set of ITrFSS z regarding the bottom-level threshold bottom z is called the bottom-level soft set of and denoted by L( z; bottom z) This bottom-level soft set can be considered in those decision making problems, where the decision maker want to consider almost all opinions for decision making purpose. De nition 3.7. Positive ideal ITrFN I+ = (aI+, bI+, cI+, dI+); ( I+, I+) is de ned by: for each A, aI+ = max x U d F{A}( )(x), bI+ = max x U b F{A}( )(x), cI+ = max x U c F{A}( )(x), dI+ = max x U d F{A}( )(x), I+ = max x U F{A}( )(x), I+ = min x U F{A}( )(x). Negetive ideal ITrFN I = (aI , bI , cI , dI ); ( I , I ) is de ned by: for each A, aI = min x U d F{A}( )(x), bI = min x U b F{A}( )(x), cI = min x U c F{A}( )(x), dI = min x U d F{A}( )(x), I = min x U F{A}( )(x), I = max x U F{A}( )(x). The distances of each object in an ITrFSS with the positive/negative ideal ITrFNs are computed by D+ i = DH(xi, I+), i = 1, 2, ..., m and D i = DH(xi, I ), i = 1, 2, ..., m. Closeness coe cient CCi of each alternative i = 1, 2, ..., m is calculated as CCi = D i D+ i +D i When the closeness coe cient of an alternative is more, the di erence between it and the negative ideal ITrFN is more, i.e., the alternative is more similar to the positive ideal ITrFN. In other words, the closeness coe cient of an object is closer to 1 as it is closer to the positive ideal ITrFN and more distant from the negative ideal ITrFN. Below we present the adjustable approach to ITrFSS based decision making using threshold ITrFSs and level soft sets. Let z = ( F{A}, E) be an ITrFSS with alter- natives di, i = 1, ..., m and attributes/parameters sj, j = 1, 2, ...n. Following steps explores the optimal alternatives(s) based on the proposed ideas. Algorithm 1 Step 1. ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is taken as input. 108 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 Table 4.

The threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set of the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is computed. As per requirements, one may compute mid-level threshold ITrFS mid z or top-level threshold ITrFS top z or bottom-level threshold ITrFS bottom z which are respectively de ned in De nitions 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. Step 3. The level soft set is computed from the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) using mid z or top z or bottom z to produce respectively mid-level soft set L ( z; mid z) or top-level soft set L ( z; top z) or bottom-level soft set L ( z; bottom z). Score and accuracy function of ITrFN, given in De nition 2.8, are used to compute the level soft sets. Step 4. The level soft set L ( z; mid z) or L ( z; top z) or L ( z; bottom z) is presented as a crisp relation R, where R = [rij]mn. Here m be the number of alternatives and n be the number of parameters/attributes. Step 5. The choice value ci for each alternative di, i = 1, 2, ..., m is determined form the relation R, ci = nP j=1 rij, where rij {0, 1}. Step 6. Alternative dk, k 1, 2, ..., m is selected as optimal decision if ck = maxici i Step 7. If k has more than one value, then any one of dk may be chosen. Following steps 8, 9 and 10 are used to validate the results of Algorithm 1. Step 8. The di erence of each alternative di, i = 1, 2, ..., m from the positive ideal ITrFN I+ = (aI+, bI+, cI+, dI+); ( I+ I+, ) and the negative ideal ITrFN I = (aI , bI , cI , dI ); ( I I , ) is calculated. Normalized Hamming distance, given in De nition 2.9, is used to nd the di erences. Step 9. The closeness coe cient CCi of each alternative di, i = 1, 2, ..., m is computed using the di erence of the alternative from positive ideal ITrFN and negative ideal ITrFN. Step 10. Alternative with maximum closeness coe cient is selected. Algorithm 1 has been illustrated using the following example. Example 3.8. Suppose Mr. X wants to buy a car among a set of ve cars (alter- natives) U = u1, u2, u3, u4, u5={Scorpio, Innova, Bolero, Xylo, Xuv5} which have a set of four attributes given by E = s1, s2, s3, s4={Fuel economy, Price, Comfort, Design}. Information about the attributes of di erent cars is represented using an ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) which is given below in tabular form (Table 4). 109 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math.

Computation procedures of these threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy sets (mid z, top z and bottom z) are respectively given in De nitions 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. mid z = {s1, (0.46, 0.56, 0.56, 0.74)(0.52, 0.34)}, {s2, (0.46, 0.58, 0.62, 0.76)(0.52, 0.4)}, {s3, (0.44, 0.56, 0.6, 0.7)(0.54, 0.34)}, {s4, (0.48, 0.58, 0.6, 0.74)(0.44, 0.42)} top z = {s1, (0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 0.1)(0.7, 0.1)}, {s2, (0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9)(0.7, 0.1)}, {s3, (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.1)(0.7, 0.1)}, {s4, (0.7, 0.8, 0.8, 0.9)(0.6, 0.3)} bottom z = {s1, (0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.6)(0.3, 0.5)}, {s2, (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6)(0.3, 0.6)}, {s3, (0.1, 0.2, 0.2, 0.3)(0.3, 0.5)}, {s4, (0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.6)(0.3, 0.5)}. Level soft sets such as mid-level soft set L ( z; mid z) top-level soft set L ( z; top z) and bottom-level soft set L ( z; bottom z) and their corresponding choice values are displayed in Table 5. Table 5 shows that the optimal decision is to select the car u2 i.e., Innova if one uses mid-level threshold. Car Scorpio ( u1) or Xuv5 (u5) will be selected if one uses top-level threshold. When one uses bottom-level threshold, car Innova (u2) will be the optimal decision. 4. Adjustable approach to weighted ITrFSS based decision making De nition 4.1. Let P(U) be the set of all intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy subsets of U, E be the set of parameters, and A E. A weighted ITrFSS is a triple = ( F{A}, E, ), where ( F{A}, E) is called ITrFSS over U and : A [0, 1] is an weight function specifying the weight wj = ( j) for each attribute j A. Weighted ITrFSS is considered as a special case of ITrFSS, where importance 110 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 of di erent parameters are di erent and the parameters are categorized by their respective weights. Below we present the adjustable approach to weighted ITrFSS based decision making using threshold ITrFSs and level soft sets. Algorithm 2 The algorithm is explained below stepwise. Step 1. Weighted ITrFSS = ( F{A}, E, ) is taken as input. Weights of the at- tributes are computed using fuzzy AHP. Step 2. The threshold intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy set of the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) is computed. As per requirements, one may compute mid-level threshold ITrFS mid z or top-level threshold ITrFS top z or bottom-level threshold ITrFS bottom z which are respectively de ned in De nitions 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6. Step 3. The level soft set is computed from the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) using mid z or top z or bottom z to produce respectively mid-level soft set L ( z; mid z) or top-level soft set L ( z; top z) or bottom-level soft set L ( z; bottom z). Score and accuracy function of ITrFN, given in De nition 2.8, are used to compute the level soft sets. Step 4. The level soft set L ( z; mid z) or L ( z; top z) or L ( z; bottom z) is presented as a crisp relation R, where R = [rij]mn. Here m be the number of alternatives and n be the number of parameters/attributes. Step 5. The weighted choice value wi for each alternative di, i = 1, 2, ..., m is deter- mined form the relation R, wi = nP j=1 jrij, where rij {0, 1}. Step 6. Alternative dk, k 1, 2, ..., m is selected as optimal decision if wk = maxiwi i Step 7. If k has more than one value, then any one of dk may be chosen. Steps 8, 9 and 10 of algorithm 1, described earlier, are also used here to validate the results. Algorithm 2 has been illustrated using the following example. Example 4.2. Let us consider the trapezoidal fuzzy comparison matrix [37] for the attributes E = {s1, s2, s3, s4} as considered in Example 3.8, is given below: 1 (1, 2, 3, 4) (2, 3, 4, 5) (2, 3, 4, 5) (0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1) 1 (1, 2, 3, 4) (1, 2, 3, 4) (0.02, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5) (0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1) 1 (1, 2, 3, 4) (0.02, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5) (0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 1) (0.33, 0.5, 0.5, 1) 1 . Using the linear goal programming model [37], the normalized trapezoidal fuzzy weight vector is computed as: W = {(0.35, 0.45, 0.53, 0.53), (0.16, 0.22, 0.31, 0.38), (0.12, 0.15, 0.15, 0.19), (0.08, 0.09, 0.10, 0.15)T }. Using weight vector and expected values, the attributes weights are computed as: 1 = 0.47, 2 = 0.27, 3 = 0.15, 4 = 0.10. Then the tabular representation of the ITrFSS z = ( F{A}, E) along with the corre- sponding mid-level (mid z), top-level (top z), and bottom-level (bottom z) threshold 111 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 Table 6. Tabular representation of the mid-level, top-level, and bottom-level soft sets and their weighted choice values L ( z; mid z) s1, 1 = 0.47 s2, 2 = 0.27 s3, 3 = 0.15 s4, 4 = 0.10 ici u1 0 1 0 1 0.37 u2 1 1 1 0 0.89 u3 1 0 0 0 0.47 u4 0 0 1 0 0.15 u5 0 1 0 1 0.37 L ( z; top z) s1, 1 = 0.47 s2, 2 = 0.27 s3, 3 = 0.15 s4, 4 = 0.10 ici u1 0 1 0 0 0.27 u2 0 0 0 0 0 u3 0 0 0 0 0 u4 0 0 0 0 0 u5 0 1 0 0 0.27 L ( z; bottom z) s1, 1 = 0.47 s2, 2 = 0.27 s3, 3 = 0.15 s4, 4 = 0.10 ici u1 0 1 1 1 0.52 u2 1 1 1 1 0.99 u3 1 0 0 1 0.57 u4 1 0 1 1 0.72 u5 0 1 1 1 0.52 intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy sets remain similar as shown in example 3.2. Level soft sets such as mid-level soft set L ( z; mid z), top-level soft set L ( z; top z), and bottom-level soft set L ( z; bottom z) and their corresponding weighted choice values are given in Table 6. Table 6 shows that the optimal decision is to select the car u2 i.e., Innova if one uses mid-level threshold. Car Scorpio (u1 ) or Xuv5 (u5) will be selected if one uses top-level threshold. When one uses bottom-level threshold, car Innova (u2) will be the optimal decision. Although the decisions are similar with table 5, but these may be changed with some changes in the trapezoidal fuzzy comparison matrix. Validation of results using closeness coe cient 112 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 Table 7. Closeness coe cient of the alternatives Closeness coe cient u1 u2 u3 u4 u5 0.310701 0.382799 0.299685 0.30036 0.340284 The closeness coe cients of various alternatives are shown in Table 7, which re ects that the alternative u2, i.e., car Innova has the highest closeness coe cient. In the proposed adjustable approaches based on ITrFSS and weighted ITrFSS, car Innova (u2) has been selected as the optimal decision, when the middle-level or bottom-level thresholds are used. But the result of using top-level threshold is found to be di erent which is either u1 or u5. This is due to the fact that a few numbers of alternatives can participate in case of top-level threshold. In contrast, more numbers of alternatives are allowed to participate in mid-level and bottom-level thresholds. Due to the participation of more number of alternatives in the cases of mid-level and bottom-level thresholds, the nal outcome is same as found as using closeness coe cient. 5. Comparative study Decision makers often prefer to express their opinions using linguistic terms rather than exact numeric values since linguistic terms can capture the uncertainty more closely. For the purpose of computation, the linguistic terms must be converted to some suitable numerical values. Among some other options, ITrFNs are consid- ered to be more suitable for the said task as ITrFNs represent both of the mem- bership and non-membership functions using trapezoidal fuzzy numbers where the trapezoidal fuzzy numbers are piecewise linear and trapezoidal. Since ITrFSS based approaches use ITrFNs to represent the necessary information, thus ITrFSS based decision making approaches are more appropriate for many real life problems. In the existing adjustable approaches [18, 30, 19, 40], the authors have used FSS, IV- IFSS, and IFSS respectively to investigate the decision making problem, however, in this paper, we apply ITrFSS to solve the decision making problem. Since ITrFSS is a generalization of FSS and IFSS, hence the proposed approaches are more gen- eral compared to [18] and [19]. Moreover, the proposed approach has performed a validation testing using closeness coe cient whereas none of the relevant existing approaches performed validation testing. 6. Conclusions In this paper, we generalize the approaches introduced by Feng et al. [18] and Jiang et al. [19] in the framework of ITrFSS. We present as adjustable approach to decision making using the proposed ITrFSS, thresholds and level soft sets. This approach is known as adjustable as it can adjust the decision makers judgements with respect to their thoughts whenever necessary using di erent thresholds. The subjectivity in the decision making activities and inexact human thoughts act as a basis of the adjustable approach. We have also introduced weighted ITrFSS and 113 S. Das et al./Ann. Fuzzy Math. Inform. 16 (2018), No. 1, 99 116 applied it in adjustable approach. The weights of various attributes of the weighted ITrFSS are derived using fuzzy AHP. Closeness coe cient has been used to validate the results of the adjustable approaches. In future, researchers may study the ap- plications of level soft sets and thresholds in di erent extensions of fuzzy soft sets, vague sets and rough sets theory. References [1] Z. Aiwu and G.
