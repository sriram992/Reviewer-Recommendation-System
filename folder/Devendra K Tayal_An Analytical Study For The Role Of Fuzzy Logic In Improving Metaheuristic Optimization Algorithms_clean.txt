This paper presents an ana lytical study in the role of fuzzy logic in the area of meta heuristics using Web of Science (WoS) as the data source. In this case, 178 research papers are extracted from it in the time span of 1989-2016. This paper analyzes vari ous aspects of a research publication in a scientometric manner. The top cited research papers, country wise con tribution, topmost organizations, top research areas, top source titles, control terms and WoS categories are ana lyzed. Also, the top 3 fuzzy evolutionary algorithms are extracted and their top research papers are mentioned along with their topmost research domain. Since neuro fuzzy logic poses feasible options for solving numerous research problems, hence a section is also included by the authors to present an analytical study regarding research in it. Overall, this study helps in evaluating the recent research patterns in the field of fuzzy metaheuristics along with envisioning the future trends for the same. While on one hand this helps in providing a new path to the researchers who are beginners in this field as they can start exploring it through the analysis mentioned here, on the other hand it provides an insight to profes sional researchers too who can dig a little deeper in this field using knowledge from this study.

Introduction While dealing with mathematical and computer science application based optimizations, metaheuris tics are considered to be among the best computing solutions [1]. Evolutionary computing is a subset of metaheuristics that are motivated by the concept of biological evolution. Instances include genetic algo rithm, differential evolution and genetic program ming. Swarm intelligence includes methods like, particle swarm optimization, artificial bee colony algorithm etc. Genetic algorithm is one of the most popular metaheuristic algorithms that is based on the notions of natural selection [2]. It follows the con cept of the survival of the fittest and utilizes a fit ness function for optimization. It finds its applications in various domains ranging from control engineering to natural language processing. Another category of metaheuristic algorithms is particle swarm optimization (PSO) which uses an iter ative method of evaluation for optimization [3]. A par ticular population of candidate solutions is moved in the search space till an optimum solution is achieved. Various other algorithms also exist that help in opti mization using nature inspired computing such as the artificial bee colony (ABC) algorithm which replicates the behavior of the honey bee swarm for practical engineering applications [4]. Fuzzy logic has also been closely associated to op timization, mainly because of its ability to handle un certainty, vagueness and imprecision. Due to this it is applied in amalgamation with existing metaheuristic algorithms to give better results. This gives rise to the fuzzy genetic algorithm, fuzzy particle swarm optimi zation and fuzzy artificial bee colony algorithm. These algorithms have been applied on various applications mainly in the field of computer science. Fuzzy evolu tionary computing also provides a way to implement real life natural language processing applications like text summarization. Hence one can say that fuzzy log ic and metaheuristics go hand in hand. In this paper, an analytical study has been per formed to highlight the role of fuzzy logic in meta heuristics, evolutionary computing and neuro fuzzy logic. The source of research papers is taken to be Web of Science (WoS). 178 research papers are extracted from it from the time span 1989-2016 [5-182]. The top cited research papers, top research areas, top WoS core categories, fuzzy evolutionary based algorithms, topmost organizations, country wise contribution, top source titles and various control terms are analyzed. The control terms help in identifying the most com monly discussed research concepts in this field. The top 3 fuzzy evolutionary algorithms obtained are high lighted along with their top research papers and top most research domain. This study helps in evaluating the recent research patterns in the field of fuzzy meta heuristics and fuzzy evolutionary computing. Also, it assists in predicting the future trends that might occur.
