Towards this end, rstly, we investigate the conditions under which a QL-operation becomes a fuzzy implication without imposing any conditions on the underlying operations. Following this, we discuss the conditions under which this family satis es some desirable algebraic properties. Based on the obtained results and existing characterization results, the intersections between QL-implications and the two most established families of fuzzy implications, viz., (S,N)- and R-implications are determined. It is shown that QL-implications contain the set of all R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms that are also (S,N)-implications. Finally, the overlaps between QL-implications and the recently proposed f- and g-implications are also studied. 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Introduction Fuzzy implications were introduced and studied in the literature as a generalization of the classical implication operation that obeys the truth table provided in Table 1. Following are the two main ways of de ning an implication in the Boolean lattice (L, , , ): p q p q, (1) p q max{t L | p t q}, (2) where p, q L and the relation  is de ned in the usual way, i.e., pq iff p q = q, for every p, q L. Implication (1) is usually called the material implication, while (2) is from the intuitionistic logic framework, where the implication is obtained as the residuum of the conjunction, and is often called as the pseudo-complement of p relative to q (see [6]). It is important to note that, despite their different formulas, expressions (1) and (2) are equivalent in the Boolean lattice (L, , , ). Interestingly, in the fuzzy logic framework, where the truth values can vary in the unit interval [0, 1], the natural generalizations of the above de nitions, viz., (S,N)- and R-implications, are not equivalent.

Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 159 Table 1 Truth table for the classical implication p q p q 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 led to some intensive research on fuzzy implications for close to three decades. Quite understandably then, the most established and well-studied classes of fuzzy implications are the above (S,N)- and R-implications (cf. [9,10,12,17]). For a broader analysis of fuzzy implications and their applications we refer the readers to Mas et al. [22] and the latest monograph [5]. Yet another popular way of obtaining fuzzy implications is as a generalization of the following implication de ned in quantum logic: p q p (p q). Needless to state, when the truth values are restricted to {0, 1} its truth table coincides with that of the material and intuitionistic-logic implications. However, QL-implications have not received as much attention as (S,N)- and R-implications within fuzzy logic. Per- haps, one of the reasons can be attributed to the fact that not all members of this family satisfy one of the main properties expected of a fuzzy implication, viz., left antitonicity (I1) (see De nition 3.1 and Remark 4.3). Moreover, in the earlier works, some conditions imposed on the fuzzy logic operations employed in the de nition of QL-implications restricted both the class of operations from which QL-implications could be obtained and the properties these implications satis ed (see Remark 4.22 for details). Interest on QL-implications has seen some rise in the recent past and some works have appeared on them. These can be broadly classi ed as follows: (i) Studies that focus on QL-implications and their basic algebraic properties as in Trillas et al. [29], Mas et al. [21], Shi et al. [26], and Jayaram and Baczy nski [14]. (ii) Works that investigate QL-implications as part of determining which families of implications satisfy a property under consideration, viz., Fodor [11], Trillas and Alsina [27], Trillas et al. [28], Shi et al. [25], and Jayaram [13]. Once again, most of these studies have been done after restricting the underlying T, S, N operations to certain families and hence are less general in their obtained results. For example, in Trillas et al. [28] their investigations have been done only in the context of continuous T and S and strong N, while Mas et al. [21] consider QL-implications where the underlying N is strong, but they do consider the non-continuous t-conorm SnM. However, recently Shi et al. [26] have investigated QL-implications, where T and S are not always assumed to be continuous, though N is always a strong fuzzy negation and their subsequent analysis is predominantly for the class of continuous operations. In this work, we study the family of QL-implications in fuzzy logic, without any restrictions on the underlying oper- ations. We propose necessary and/or suf cient conditions on the underlying operations under which QL-implications satisfy some of the most desirable algebraic properties. Following this, a partial characterization of the intersections that exist between the family of QL-implications and the families of (S,N)- and R-implications is given. Most importantly, it is shown that QL-implications contain the set of all R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms that are also (S,N)-implications. Finally, we also investigate the overlaps that exist between QL-implications and the recently proposed f- and g-implications (see [32]). 2. Preliminaries We assume that the reader is familiar with the classical results concerning basic fuzzy logic connectives, but to make this work more self-contained, we introduce basic notations used in the text and we brie y mention some of the concepts and results employed in the rest of the work. By  we denote the family of all increasing bijections : [0, 1] [0, 1]. We say that functions f, g: [0, 1]n [0, 1], where n N, are -conjugate (cf. [18, p. 156]), if there 160 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 exists   such that g = f, where f(x1, ... , xn) :=  1( f ((x1), ... , (xn))), x1, ... , xn [0, 1]. Equivalently, g is said to be the -conjugate of f. 2.1. Fuzzy negations, t-norms and t-conorms De nition 2.1 (see Fodor and Roubens [10, p. 3], Klement et al. [16, De nition 11.3]). A decreasing function N: [0, 1] [0, 1] is called a fuzzy negation, if N(0) = 1, N(1) = 0. A fuzzy negation N is called (i) strict, if it is strictly decreasing and continuous; (ii) strong, if it is an involution, i.e., N(N(x)) = x for all x [0, 1]; (iii) non-vanishing, if N(x) = 0 x = 1. Example 2.2. The classical negation NC(x) = 1 x is a strong negation, while NK(x) = 1 x2 is only strict, whereas the G del negations, ND1 and ND2 which are the least and greatest fuzzy negations are non-strong negations: ND1(x) =  1 if x = 0, 0 if x > 0, ND2(x) =  1 if x < 1, 0 if x = 1. For more examples of fuzzy negations see [10,17]. De nition 2.3 (Schweizer and Sklar [24], Klement et al. [16]). (i) An associative, commutative and increasing operation T : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a triangular norm (t-norm, for short), if it has the neutral element equal to 1. (ii) An associative, commutative and increasing operation S: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a triangular conorm (t-conorm, for short), if it has the neutral element equal to 0. If F is an associative binary operation on [a, b] with the neutral element e, then the power notation x[n] F , where n N0, is de ned by x[n] F := e if n = 0, x if n = 1, F(x, x[n 1] F ) if n > 1. De nition 2.4 (Klement et al. [16, De nitions 1.23, 2.9 and 2.13]). A t-norm T (t-conorm S, respectively) is said to be (i) continuous, if it is continuous in both the arguments; (ii) left-continuous, if it is left-continuous in each component; (iii) right-continuous, if it is right-continuous in each component; (iv) idempotent, if T (x, x) = x (S(x, x) = x, respectively) for all x [0, 1]; (v) Archimedean, if for every x, y (0, 1) there is n N such that x[n] T < y (x[n] S > y, respectively); (vi) strict, if T (S, respectively) is continuous and strictly monotone, i.e., T (x, y) < T (x, z) whenever x > 0 (S(x, y) < S(x, z) whenever x < 1, respectively) and y < z; (vii) nilpotent, if T (S, respectively) is continuous and if each x (0, 1) is a nilpotent element, i.e., if for each x (0, 1) there exists n N such that x[n] T = 0 (x[n] S = 1, respectively); (viii) positive, if T (x, y) = 0 (S(x, y) = 1, respectively) implies that either x = 0 or y = 0 (x = 1 or y = 1, respectively). M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 161 Remark 2.5. (i) For a continuous t-norm T the Archimedean property is given by the simpler condition, that T (x, x) < x, for all x (0, 1) (see [12, Proposition 5.1.2]). (ii) If a t-norm T is continuous and Archimedean, then T is nilpotent if and only if there exists some nilpotent element of T, which is equivalent to the existence of some zero divisor of T, i.e., there exist x, y (0, 1) such that T (x, y) = 0 (see [16, Theorem 2.18]). (iii) If a t-norm T is strict or nilpotent, then it is Archimedean. Conversely, every continuous and Archimedean t-norm is either strict or nilpotent (see [16, p. 33]). (iv) By the duality between t-norms and t-conorms, similar properties as above hold for t-conorms with the appropriate changes in either the inequality or the neutral element (cf. [16, Remark 2.20, 10, Chapter 1]). De nition 2.6 (cf. Klement et al. [16, De nition 1.25]). A t-norm T is said to satisfy 1-Lipschitz condition or 1-Lipschitzianity, if |T(x1, y1) T (x2, y2)||x1 x2| + |y1 y2|, x1, x2, y1, y2 [0, 1]. (3) Remark 2.7. (i) Any 1-Lipschitz t-norm is also continuous but the converse, in general, is not true (see [16, Example 1.26]). (ii) One well-known family of t-norms that satis es Lipschitzianity is the family of Frank t-norms T  F , where  [0, ], de ned as follows: T  F (x, y) = TM(x, y) if  = 0, TP(x, y) if  = 1, TLK(x, y) if  = , log  1 + (x 1) (y 1)  1  otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. In fact, this family was obtained while characterizing the following so-called Frank functional equation T (x, y) + S(x, y) = x + y, for all x, y [0, 1]. We will refer to the above family in the sequel. Example 2.8 (see Klement et al. [16]). Tables 2 and 3 list the basic t-norms and t-conorms with the properties they satisfy. Note that TM, TP are positive t-norms, while TLK, TD and TnM are not. Similarly, SM, SP are positive t-conorms, while SLK, SD and SnM are not. 2.2. Negations from t-conorms and t-norms One can associate a fuzzy negation to any t-norm or t-conorm as given in the de nition below. De nition 2.9 (see Nguyen and Walker [23, De nition 5.5.2], Klement et al. [16, p. 232] or Baczy nski and Jayaram [4]). (i) Let T be a t-norm. A function NT : [0, 1] [0, 1] de ned as NT (x) := sup{t [0, 1] | T (x, t) = 0}, x [0, 1], (4) is called the natural negation of T. (ii) Let S be a t-conorm. A function NS: [0, 1] [0, 1] de ned as NS(x) := inf{t [0, 1] | S(x, t) = 1}, x [0, 1], (5) is called the natural negation of S. 162 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Table 2 Examples of basic t-norms and their properties Name Formula Properties Minimum TM(x, y) = min(x, y) Continuous, idempotent Product TP(x, y) = xy Strict ukasiewicz TLK(x, y) = max(x + y 1, 0) Nilpotent Drastic product TD(x, y) =  0 if x, y [0, 1) min(x, y) otherwise Archimedean, non-continuous Nilpotent minimum TnM(x, y) =  0 if x + y 1 min(x, y) otherwise Non-Archimedean, left-continuous Table 3 Examples of basic t-conorms and their properties Name Formula Properties Maximum SM(x, y) = max(x, y) Continuous, idempotent Probabilistic sum SP(x, y) = x + y xy Strict ukasiewicz SLK(x, y) = min(x + y, 1) Nilpotent Drastic sum SD(x, y) =  1 if x, y (0, 1] max(x, y) otherwise Archimedean, non-continuous Nilpotent maximum SnM(x, y) =  1 if x + y 1 max(x, y) otherwise Non-Archimedean, right-continuous Table 4 Examples of natural negations from basic t-norms and t-conorms t-norm T NT t-conorm S NS Positive ND1 Positive ND2 TLK NC SLK NC TD ND2 SD ND1 TnM NC SnM NC Remark 2.10. (i) It is easy to prove that both NT and NS are fuzzy negations. In the literature NT is also called the contour line C0 of T, while NS is called the contour line D1 of S (see [19,20]). (ii) Since for any t-norm T and any t-conorm S we have T (x, 0) = 0 and S(x, 1) = 1 for all x [0, 1], the appropriate sets in (4) and (5) are non-empty. (iii) Notice that if S(x, y) = 1 for some x, y [0, 1], then y  NS(x) and if T (x, y) = 0 for some x, y [0, 1], then y  NT (x). Moreover, if any z < NT (x), then T (x, z) = 0 and if any z > NS(x), then S(x, z) = 1. Example 2.11. Table 4 gives the natural negations of the basic t-norms and t-conorms. The next result will be useful in the sequel. Proposition 2.12 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Proposition 2.11], cf. Maes and De Baets [19]). If a t-conorm S is right-continuous, then (i) for every x, y [0, 1] the following equivalence holds: S(x, y) = 1 NS(x) y; M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 163 (ii) the in mum in (5) is the minimum, i.e., NS(x) = min{t [0, 1] | S(x, t) = 1}, x [0, 1], where the right side exists for all x [0, 1]; (iii) NS is right-continuous. It is well-known that if an NT obtained from a left-continuous t-norm T is continuous, then it is strong. In the proof of this result, the equality NT NT NT = NT plays an important role (see [10, p. 28]). However, the above equality is not true for all t-norms, as shown in the following example. Example 2.13. Consider the non-left-continuous t-norm given in [16, Example 1.24(i)] as follows: TB(x, y) =  0 if (x, y) (0, 0.5)2, min(x, y) otherwise, x, y [0, 1], whose natural negation is the following: NTB(x) = 1 x = 0, 0.5 x (0, 0.5), 0 x [0.5, 1]. It can be quite easily veri ed that NTB NTB NTB  NTB. However, as we show below, the result still remains valid for any t-norm T. Theorem 2.14. Let T be any t-norm. (i) If NT is continuous, then it is strong. (ii) If NT is discontinuous, then it is not strictly decreasing. Proof. (i) Firstly, we show that NT is strict. Assume to the contrary that NT is not strict, i.e., it is constant on some interval [x, y], where without loss of the generality, we assume that 0 < x < y < 1. Therefore there exists p [0, 1] such that NT (x) = NT (y) = p. If p = 0, then NT (x) = 0, which implies that T (, x) = T (x, ) > 0 for an arbitrary small  > 0. Therefore, NT () < x. Since NT is continuous, as  0, we have that NT (0)x. However, NT (0) = 1, a contradiction. If p = 1, then T (1 , x) = T (x, 1 ) = 0 for an arbitrary small  > 0. Thus, NT (1 )x. Since NT is continuous, as  0, we have that NT (1)x. However, NT (1) = 0, a contradiction. Hence, we consider now the situation, when p (0, 1). Since NT (z) = p for any z (x, y), by the de nition of NT we have T (z, p ) = T (p , z) = 0, T (z, p + ) = T (p + , z) > 0, for any arbitrary small  > 0. Thus NT (p + ) < z NT (p ). Since NT is continuous, as  0, we have that NT (p) = z. Now this happens for every z (x, y), which once again contradicts the fact that NT is a function itself, or the fact that NT is continuous. Hence NT is strict. 164 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 To show that NT is strong, we show that NT (NT (NT (x))) = NT (x) for all x [0, 1]. The above is clear for any x {0, 1}. Since NT is strict, for any x (0, 1) and an arbitrary small  > 0, we have the following inequalities: x  < x < x +  NT (x ) > NT (x) > NT (x + ) NT (NT (x )) < NT (NT (x)) < NT (NT (x + )). By the de nition of NT , we have T (x, NT (x + )) = T (NT (x + ), x) = 0, thus x  NT (NT (x + )), which implies that NT (x) NT (NT (NT (x + ))). Once again, by the continuity of NT , as  0, we have NT (x) NT (NT (NT (x))). Recall, from Remark 2.10(iii), that if z < NT (x), then T (z, x) = 0. Now, since NT (NT (x )) < NT (NT (x)), we also have, T (NT (NT (x )), NT (x)) = 0. Once again, by the de nition of NT , we have NT (x) NT (NT (NT (x ))), and as  0, we get NT (x) NT (NT (NT (x))). From the above inequalities, we have NT (x) = NT (NT (NT (x))) for any x [0, 1]. Now, by the continuity of NT , one can easily see that NT is involutive. (ii) Let NT be discontinuous at some p [0, 1]. By the monotonicity of NT there exist constants x, y [0, 1] such that x = lim t p+ NT (t) if p < 1, 0 if p = 1, y = lim t p NT (t) if p > 0, 1 if p = 0. From the discontinuity of decreasing negation NT at p we have x < y. Now, we consider the following two cases: (a) Let NT (p) = x. In particular this implies that p > 0. Let us x arbitrarily z (x, y). It is obvious that NT (p) < z, so by the de nition of NT we get T (p, z) > 0, which implies NT (z) p. On the other side, NT (p ) y for an arbitrary small  > 0, thus T (p , z) = 0, therefore NT (z) p . Taking the limit  0 we get NT (z) p. Since z was arbitrarily xed, the above implies that NT (z) = p for every z (x, y) and hence NT is constant on this interval (x, y). (b) Let NT (p) = z , where x < z  y. In particular this implies that p < 1. We now claim that NT is a constant on the interval (x, z ). Let us x arbitrarily z (x, z ). In this case we have that T (p, z) = 0, so NT (z) p. Once again, we claim that NT (z) = p. Instead, if NT (z) > p, then T (p + , z) = 0 for some  > 0. Thus, by the de nition of NT , we have that NT (p + )z, and from the decreasing nature of NT and the de nition of x we obtain x  NT (p + )z, a contradiction to the fact that x < z. Therefore NT (z) = p for every z (x, z ) and hence NT is a constant on this interval (x, z ).  Corollary 2.15. For a t-norm T the following statements are equivalent: (i) NT is strictly decreasing. (ii) NT is continuous. (iii) NT is strict. (iv) NT is strong. Similarly, one can prove the following results. M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 165 Theorem 2.16. Let S be any t-conorm. (i) If NS is continuous, then it is strong. (ii) If NS is discontinuous, then it is not strictly decreasing. Corollary 2.17. For a t-conorm S the following statements are equivalent: (i) NS is strictly decreasing. (ii) NS is continuous. (iii) NS is strict. (iv) NS is strong. 2.3. The law of excluded middle Now we analyze the law of excluded middle, which in the classical case has the following form: p p = . De nition 2.18. Let S be a t-conorm and N a fuzzy negation. We say that the pair (S, N) satis es the law of excluded middle, if S(N(x), x) = 1, x [0, 1]. (LEM) Now the following result is easy to see. Lemma 2.19. Let S be a t-conorm and N a fuzzy negation. If the pair (S,N) satis es (LEM), then (i) N  NS; (ii) NS N(x)x, for all x [0, 1]. Example 2.20. (i) Any t-conorm satis es (LEM) with the greatest fuzzy negation ND2. Indeed, for any t-conorm S and x [0, 1] we have S(ND2(x), x) =  S(1, x) if x < 1 S(0, x) if x = 1 =  1 if x < 1 x if x = 1 = 1. From the previous result and Table 4 it follows that if S is a positive t-conorm, then it satis es (LEM) only with the greatest fuzzy negation ND2. (ii) However, no t-conorm satis es (LEM) with the least fuzzy negation ND1. Indeed, for any t-conorm S and x (0, 1) we have S(ND1(x), x) = S(0, x) = x  1. Example 2.21. The fact that the conditions in Lemma 2.19 are only necessary and not suf cient follow from the following example. Consider the non-right-continuous nilpotent maximum t-conorm SnM (x, y) =  1 if x + y > 1, max(x, y) otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. Then its natural negation is the classical negation, i.e., NSnM (x) = NC(x) = 1 x and NC NC(x) = x for all x [0, 1]. However, the pair (SnM , NC) does not satisfy (LEM). Indeed, for x = 0.5 we get SnM (NC(0.5), 0.5) = SnM (0.5, 0.5) = 0.5. Interestingly, for the right-continuous t-conorms the condition (i) from Lemma 2.19 is both necessary and suf cient. 166 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Proposition 2.22 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Proposition 2.16]). For a right-continuous t-conorm S and a fuzzy nega- tion N the following statements are equivalent: (i) The pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). (ii) N  NS. In the class of continuous functions we get the following important fact. Proposition 2.23 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Proposition 2.17]). For a continuous t-conorm S and a continuous fuzzy negation N the following statements are equivalent: (i) The pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). (ii) S is a nilpotent t-conorm, i.e., S is -conjugate with the ukasiewicz t-conorm SLK, i.e., there exists  , which is uniquely determined, such that S has the representation S(x, y) =  1(min((x) + (y), 1)), x, y [0, 1], and N(x) NS(x) =  1(1 (x)), x [0, 1]. 2.4. De Morgan triples Finally, in this subsection we present some results regarding De Morgan triples. De nition 2.24 (Klement et al. [16, p. 232]). A triple (T, S, N), where T is a t-norm, S is a t-conorm and N is a strict negation, is called a De Morgan triple, if T (x, y) = N 1(S(N(x), N(y))), S(x, y) = N 1(T (N(x), N(y))), for all x, y [0, 1]. Theorem 2.25 (Klement et al. [16, p. 232]). For a t-norm T, t-conorm S and a strict fuzzy negation N the following statements are equivalent: (i) (T, S, N) is a De Morgan triple. (ii) N is a strong negation and S is the N-dual of T, i.e., S(x, y) = N(T (N(x), N(y))), for all x, y [0, 1]. Using the above theorem it can be shown that the following relation exists between NT and NS. Theorem 2.26 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Proposition 2.21]). Let T be a left-continuous t-norm and S be a t-conorm. If (T, NT , S) is a De Morgan triple, then (i) NS = NT is a strong negation, (ii) S is right-continuous. 3. Fuzzy implications In the literature, especially at the beginnings, we can nd several different de nitions of fuzzy implications. In this article we will use the following one, which is equivalent to the de nition introduced by Fodor and Roubens [10, De nition 1.15] (see also [15, p. 50]). De nition 3.1. A function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a fuzzy implication, if it satis es, for all x, y, z [0, 1], the following conditions: if x  y then I(x, z) I(y, z), (I1) M. Baczy nski, B.

(I5) The set of all fuzzy implications will be denoted by FI. Remark 3.2. Directly from De nition 3.1 we see that each fuzzy implication I satis es the following left and right boundary conditions, respectively: I(0, y) = 1, y [0, 1], (LB) I(x, 1) = 1, x [0, 1]. (RB) Therefore, I satis es also the normality condition: I(0, 1) = 1. (NC) Example 3.3. Table 5 lists a few basic fuzzy implications. Additional properties of fuzzy implications were postulated in many works (see, for example [31,10,12]). The most important of them are presented below. De nition 3.4. A fuzzy implication I is said to satisfy (i) the left neutrality property, if I(1, y) = y, y [0, 1]. (NP) (ii) the exchange principle, if I(x, I(y, z)) = I(y, I(x, z)), x, y, z [0, 1]. (EP) (iii) the identity principle, if I(x, x) = 1, x [0, 1]. (IP) 168 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 (iv) the ordering property, if I(x, y) = 1 x  y, x, y [0, 1]. (OP) (v) the law of contraposition with respect to a fuzzy negation N, CP(N), if I(x, y) = I(N(y), N(x)), x, y [0, 1]. (CP) Just as in the case of t-norms or t-conorms, a fuzzy negation can be obtained from fuzzy implications too as follows. De nition 3.5. Let I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] be any function. If the function NI: [0, 1] [0, 1] given by NI(x) := I(x, 0), x [0, 1], is a fuzzy negation, then it is called the natural negation of I. It should be noted that for any I FI we have (I3) and (I5), so NI is a fuzzy negation in this case. In the following results we discuss some relationships that exist between the above properties of fuzzy implications. They will be useful in the sequel. Proposition 3.6 (cf. Fodor and Roubens [10, Corollary 1.1]). If a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] satis es (EP) and (OP), then NI is either a strong negation or a discontinuous negation. Lemma 3.7 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [3, Lemma 2.2], cf. Bustince et al. [7, Lemma 1]). Let I be any [0, 1]2 [0, 1] function and N be a fuzzy negation. If I satis es (NP) and CP (N), then N = NI is a strong negation. Lemma 3.8 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [3, Corollary 2.3]). Let I FI satisfy (NP). If NI is not a strong negation, then I does not satisfy the contrapositive symmetry (CP) with any fuzzy negation. Lemma 3.9 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [3, Lemma 2.4], cf. Bustince et al. [7, Lemma 1]). Let I be any [0, 1]2 [0, 1] function and NI be a strong negation. (i) If I satis es CP(NI), then I satis es (NP). (ii) If I satis es (EP), then I satis es (I3), (NP) and CP(NI). Corollary 3.10 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [3, Corollary 2.5]). Let I FI satisfy (NP) and (EP). Then I satis es CP(N) with some fuzzy negation N if and only if N = NI is a strong negation. 4. QL-operations and QL-implications In this section, we de ne a QL-operation as a generalization of the quantum logic implication. However, it should be noted that not every such operation de ned is a fuzzy implication and hence we nd some suitable necessary or suf cient conditions for this to happen. Then we give many examples of QL-operations that are fuzzy implications. Following this, we investigate this family of fuzzy implications with respect to the desirable properties as proposed in De nition 3.4. 4.1. De nitions, examples and basic properties De nition 4.1. A function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a QL-operation, if there exist a t-norm T, a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N such that I(x, y) = S(N(x), T (x, y)), x, y [0, 1]. If I is a QL-operation generated from the triple (T, S, N), then we will often denote it by IT,S,N. M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 169 Table 6 Examples of basic QL-operations T S N QL-operation IT,S,N IT,S,N FI TM SM NC IZD TM SP NC I(x, y) =  1 x + x2 if x  y 1 x + xy otherwise TM SLK NC ILK C TM SD NC IDP C TM SnM NC IFD C TP SM NC I(x, y) = max(1 x, xy) TP SP NC I(x, y) = 1 x + x2y TP SLK NC IRC C TP SD NC IDP C TP SnM NC I(x, y) =  1 if y = 1 max(1 x, xy) otherwise TLK SM NC I(x, y) = max(1 x, x + y 1) TLK SP NC I(x, y) =  1 x if y 1 x 1 + x2 + xy 2x otherwise TLK SLK NC IKD C TLK SD NC I(x, y) = y if x = 1 1 x if y 1 x 1 otherwise TLK SnM NC I(x, y) = 1 if x = 0 or y = 1 1 x if y 2 2x y otherwise TD Any S NC I(x, y) = S(N(x), x) if y = 1 y if x = 1 1 x otherwise TnM SnM NC I(x, y) = 1 if x  y and y > 1 x y if x > y and y > 1 x 1 x otherwise Any T Any S ND1 I(x, y) =  T (x, y) if x > 0 1 if x = 0 Any T Any S ND2 IWB C Firstly, we investigate some properties of QL-operations. We will see that not all QL-operations are fuzzy implications in the sense of De nition 3.1. The following fact can be proven by an easy veri cation. Proposition 4.2 (cf. Shi et al. [26, Proposition 3.1]). If IT,S,N is a QL-operation, then (i) IT,S,N satis es (I2) (I5), (NC), (LB) and (NP); (ii) NIT,S,N = N. From the above proposition, it follows that a QL-operation is generated by a unique negation. Remark 4.3. A QL-operation does not always satisfy (I1). For example, consider the following function: IZD(x, y) = max(1 x, min(x, y)), x, y, [0, 1], also called in the literature as the Zadeh implication. As can be seen in Table 6, it is the QL-operation obtained from the triple (TM, SM, NC), but it does not satisfy (I1). However, the QL-operation obtained from the triple (TLK, SLK, NC) satis es (I1). In fact, it is the Kleene Dienes implication IKD, which is a fuzzy implication. Example 4.4. Table 6 lists QL-operations obtained from the basic t-norms, t-conorms and negations. In the last column we indicate whether the QL-operation is also a fuzzy implication. 170 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Therefore the rst main problem is the characterization of those QL-operations which satisfy (I1). Unfortunately, only partial results are known in the literature (cf. [26,29]). Following the terminology used by Trillas et al. [29] and Mas et al. [21], only if the QL-operation is a fuzzy implication we use the term QL-implication, and often use the equivalent expression IT,S,N FI. Lemma 4.5. If a QL-operation IT,S,N FI, then the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). Proof. If IT,S,N is a fuzzy implication, then by Remark 3.2 it satis es (RB). Thus IT,S,N(x, 1) = 1 if and only if S(N(x), T (x, 1)) = 1, i.e., S(N(x), x) = 1, for every x [0, 1].  Remark 4.6. (i) From Example 2.20(ii) we know that there does not exist any t-conorm S such that the pair (S, ND1) satis es (LEM). Therefore, by Lemma 4.5, we see that no QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, S, N), where N = ND1 is the least fuzzy negation, can be a fuzzy implication. (ii) The fact that the condition in Lemma 4.5 is only necessary and not suf cient can be seen from the QL-operation I obtained from the triple (TP, SnM, NC), which is given in Table 6. Although the pair (SnM, NC) satis es (LEM), it can be veri ed, by letting x1 = 0.8, x2 = 0.9 and y = 0.3, that x1 < x2 but I(0.8, 0.3) = 0.24 < 0.27 = I(0.9, 0.3), so this I does not satisfy (I1). (iii) From Lemma 2.19, it is easy to see that if a negation N in the triple (T, S, N) is less than the natural negation of S, i.e., if N(x) < NS(x) for some x [0, 1], then the pair (S, N) does not satisfy (LEM) and hence the QL-operation IT,S,N is not a fuzzy implication. (iv) Let S be any t-conorm and N = ND2, the greatest fuzzy negation. From Example 2.20(i) we see that the pair (S, ND2) satis es (LEM). Now, for any t-norm T we have that the QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, S, ND2) is a fuzzy implication and is, in fact, the Weber implication IWB. In fact, we have the following result. Proposition 4.7. A QL-operation IT,S,N, where S is a positive t-conorm, is a fuzzy implication if and only if N = ND2. Moreover, IT,S,N = IWB in this case. Before considering special examples of QL-implications, we show some relationship between the -conjugates of QL-implications. Theorem 4.8. If IT,S,N is a QL-implication (QL-operation, respectively), then the -conjugate of IT,S,N is also a QL-implication (QL-operation, respectively) generated from the -conjugate t-norm of T, the -conjugate t-conorm of S and the -conjugate fuzzy negation of N, i.e., if  , then (IT,S,N) = IT,S,N. Proof. Let   and let IT,S,N be a QL-implication based on the suitable operations. We now know that the operations T, S and N areat-norm,t-conormandafuzzynegation,respectively.Itisobviousthatif IT,S,N isafuzzyimplication, then (IT,S,N) is also a fuzzy implication. Now, we have (IT,S,N)(x, y) =  1(IT,S,N((x), (y))) =  1(S(N((x)), T ((x), (y)))) =  1(S(  1(N((x))),   1(T ((x), (y))))) =  1(S((N(x)), (T(x, y)))) = S(N(x), T(x, y)) = IT,S,N(x, y), for every x, y [0, 1].  M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 171 Example 4.9. Let S be a t-conorm and N a fuzzy negation such that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). (i) If T is the minimum t-norm TM, then it can be easily seen that the QL-operation obtained from the triple (TM, S, N) is always a fuzzy implication given by ITM,S,N(x, y) =  1 if x  y, S(N(x), y) if x > y, x, y [0, 1]. (6) (ii) If T is the drastic t-norm TD, then the QL-operation obtained from the triple (TD, S, N) is given by ITD,S,N(x, y) = 1 if y = 1, y if x = 1, N(x) otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. This function is not always a fuzzy implication, even if S and N satisfy (LEM). Observe that it is a fuzzy implication if and only if N(x) y for all x, y [0, 1), which means that N = ND2. In this case, of course, the QL-operation reduces, once again, to the Weber implication IWB. Now, let us consider QL-implications obtained from triples (T, S, N), where S is some continuous t-conorm. Firstly, if S is a continuous but positive t-conorm from Proposition 4.7 we know that for the QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, S, N) to be a fuzzy implication N has to be the greatest negation ND2 and that IT,S,N = IWB in this situation. Hence we consider now only non-positive continuous t-conorms. Let S be a continuous t-conorm and N a continuous fuzzy negation such that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). Then, from Proposition 2.23, there exists a unique   such that S(x, y) = (SLK)(x, y) =  1(min((x) + (y), 1)), N(x)  (NC)(x) =  1(1 (x)), for all x, y [0, 1]. Note that in this case S is a nilpotent t-conorm, i.e., it is non-positive and continuous. Let us consider the extreme case when N(x) = (NC)(x) =  1(1 (x)) (with the same increasing bijection ), in which case we have that N is a strong negation. Now, if we consider the QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, (SLK), (NC)), then since T (x, y)x for any t-norm T and x [0, 1], we obtain the following function, denoted by I,T for ease of notation (see also [29,21]): I,T (x, y) = (SLK)((NC)(x), T (x, y)) =  1(1 (x) + (T (x, y))), x, y [0, 1]. (7) The following result has been obtained by Mas et al. [21]. Theorem 4.10. For a QL-operation I,T given by (7), where T is any t-norm and  , the following statements are equivalent: (i) I,T FI. (ii) T 1 satis es the 1-Lipschitz condition (3). Remark 4.11. Since the class of t-norms satisfying the Lipschitz condition is contained in the class of continuous t-norms, we have that T 1, and hence T itself, is a continuous t-norm. The case when T is an Archimedean or an idempotent t-norm has been investigated by Fodor [11]. In fact, it is shown there that an equivalence relation exists between the t-norms T employed below and the resulting QL-implications. Example 4.12. All QL-operations I,T obtained using the following t-norms satisfy (I1) and hence are fuzzy implications (cf. Table 6). (i) If the t-norm T in (7) is -conjugate with the ukasiewicz t-norm TLK with the same  , then I,(TLK) is -conjugate with the Kleene Dienes implication IKD, i.e., I,(TLK)(x, y) = (IKD)(x, y) = max(N(x), y), x, y [0, 1]. 172 M.

Plots of the QL-implications IPC and IPR from Example 4.13: (a) IPC from the triple (TP, S2 SS, NC); (b)IPR from the triple (TP, S2 SS, NR). (ii) If the t-norm T in (7) is -conjugate with the product t-norm TP with the same  , then I,(TP) is -conjugate with the Reichenbach implication IRC, i.e., I,(TP)(x, y) = (IRC)(x, y) =  1(1 (x) + (x)(y)), x, y [0, 1]. (iii) Firstly, note that (TM) = TM for any   (see [16, Proposition 2.31]). Now, if the t-norm T in (7) is the minimum t-norm TM, then I,TM is -conjugate with the ukasiewicz implication ILK, i.e., I,TM(x, y) = (ILK)(x, y) = min( 1(1 (x) + (y), 1)), x, y [0, 1]. In the following we show yet other examples of QL-implications generated from continuous functions. Example 4.13. Let S be the Schweizer Sklar t-conorm S SS for  = 2 given by S2 SS(x, y) = 1 (max((1 x)2 + (1 y)2 1, 0))1/2, x, y [0, 1], and T be the product t-norm TP. It can be easily veri ed that the pairs (S2 SS, NC) and (S2 SS, NR), where NR(x) = 1 x, satisfy (LEM). (i) The QL-operation obtained from the triple (TP, S2 SS, NC) is given by IPC(x, y) = 1 (max(x(x + xy2 2y), 0))1/2, x, y [0, 1]. (ii) The QL-operation obtained from the triple (TP, S2 SS, NR) is given by IPR(x, y) = 1 (max(x(1 + xy2 2y), 0))1/2, x, y [0, 1]. It can be easily checked that both IPC and IPR satisfy (I1) and hence are QL-implications, whose plots are given in Fig. 1. In the rest of this section we give examples of QL-implications obtained from triples (T, S, N), where S is a non-continuous t-conorm. M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 173 Example 4.14. Let S be the drastic t-conorm SD and N any non-vanishing negation. Then the pair (SD, N) satis es (LEM). If the t-norm T is positive, then, as can be veri ed, the QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, SD, N) is a fuzzy implication given by IT,SD,N(x, y) = y if x = 1, N(x) if y = 0, 1 otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. Fig. 2(a) gives the plot of the QL-implication obtained from the triple (T, SD, NC), where T is any positive t-norm, which is in fact the Dubois Prade implication IDP (see [8]). Example 4.15. Let N be a strong negation. Consider the following t-conorm: SN nM(x, y) =  1 if x  N(y), max(x, y) if x < N(y), x, y [0, 1], (8) which is only right-continuous. If N is any negation such that N  N, then SN nM(N (x), x) = 1. (i) The QL-operation from the triple (TM, SN nM, N ) is ITM,SN nM,N (x, y) =  1 if x  y, max(N (x), y) if x > y, x, y [0, 1]. (9) In the case N = N = NC the QL-operation in (9) is a QL-implication, indeed, it is the Fodor implication IFD. Fig. 2(b) gives the plot of the QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, SNC nM, NK), where NK(x) = 1 x2. (ii) Let us consider the following N-dual t-norm of SN nM given by T N nM(x, y) =  0 if x  N(y), min(x, y) if x > N(y), x, y [0, 1]. The QL-operation obtained from the triple (T N nM, SN nM, N ) is given by IT N nM,SN nM,N (x, y) = N (x) if x  N(y), 1 if N (x) N(y), max(N (x), y) if N (x) < N(y), x, y [0, 1]. Figs. 2(c) and (d) give plots of the QL-implications obtained from the triple (T N nM, SN nM, N ), when N = N = NC and N = NC, N = NK, respectively. In fact, the following result was proven by Mas et al. [21, Corollary 2]. Proposition 4.16. Let N be a strong negation with the xed point e (0, 1), T a continuous t-norm and SN nM the t-conorm obtained from N as given in (8). Let IT,SN nM,N be the QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, SN nM, N). Then the following statements are equivalent: (i) IT,SN nM,N FI. (ii) T (x, x) = x f or all x [e, 1]. Moreover, the corresponding QL-implication is then given by IT,SN nM,N(x, y) = 1 if x, e y or (x  y < e and T (x, y) = x), y if N(x) y < x, N(x) otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. 174 M. Baczy nski, B.

QL-implications and the exchange principle Not all QL-implications satisfy (EP). However, in Theorem 6.2 we show that if a QL-operation IT,S,N is obtained from a triple (T, S, N), where N is a continuous negation, then IT,S,N satis es (EP) if and only IT,S,N is an (S,N)-implication (see Section 5.1). We deal with this topic in more detail in Section 6. 4.3. QL-implications and the identity principle The following proposition is immediate from Remark 4.6(iv), Examples 4.9 and 4.14. Proposition 4.17. A QL-implication IT,S,N satis es (IP) if (i) N = ND2, S is any t-conorm and T any t-norm, or (ii) T = TM, S is any t-conorm and N any negation such that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM), or (iii) S = SD, N is any non-vanishing negation and T is a positive t-norm. M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 175 Remark 4.18. (i) If S is a positive t-conorm, then we know, from Proposition 4.7, that the obtained QL-implication is the Weber implication IWB, which satis es (IP). (ii) However, from Example 4.12 and Proposition 4.17(iii), we see that in the case when S is not positive, we can obtain QL-implications that satisfy the identity principle (IP) for many fuzzy negations N. In fact, we have the following easy to obtain result. Proposition 4.19. If a QL-implication IT,S,N satis es (IP), then T (x, x) NS N(x) for all x [0, 1]. Proof. If IT,S,N satis es (IP), then for any x [0, 1] we have IT,S,N(x, x) = S(N(x), T (x, x)) = 1. From Remark 2.10(iii), we have that T (x, x) NS N(x), for all x [0, 1].  In the case, when the t-conorm considered in Proposition 4.19 is right-continuous, then the above condition is also suf cient. Theorem 4.20. For a QL-implication IT,S,N with a right-continuous t-conorm S the following statements are equiva- lent: (i) IT,S,N satis es (IP). (ii) T (x, x) NS N(x) for all x [0, 1]. Proof. (i) (ii) It is obvious from Proposition 4.19. (ii) (i) By the right-continuity of S, from Proposition 2.12(i) we have that, S(N(x), NS N(x)) = 1 for all x [0, 1]. Now by the monotonicity of the t-conorm S we have that IT,S,N(x, x) = S(N(x), T (x, x)) S(N(x), NS N(x)) = 1, x [0, 1], i.e., IT,S,N satis es (IP).  Example 4.21. Let us consider the ukasiewicz t-conorm SLK and the strict negation NK(x) = 1 x2. The pair (SLK, NK) satis es (LEM) and also SLK is continuous, and hence is right-continuous. Let T = TP be the product t-norm. Then the QL-operation obtained from the triple (TP, SLK, NK) is IKP(x, y) = min(1, 1 x2 + xy), x, y [0, 1]. Firstly, note that IKP satis es (I1) and hence is a fuzzy implication. Since NSLK(x) = 1 x, note also that, NSLK NK(x) = 1 NK(x) = 1 (1 x2) = x2 and hence TP(x, x) = NSLK NK(x) for all x [0, 1]. It is easy to observe that IKP satis es (IP). Remark 4.22. In one of the earliest works on QL-implications, Trillas and Valverde [30] (see also their recent work [28]) required the negation N in De nition 4.1 to be strong. Moreover, the t-norm T and t-conorm S are continuous, and are expected to form a De Morgan triple with the negation N. In fact, in Theorem 3.2 of the same work, under these restrictions, condition (ii) of Theorem 4.20 has been obtained. From their proof, it is clear that the considered T and S are both continuous and Archimedean and hence either they are strict or nilpotent, in which case they show that the aforementioned condition is not satis ed and hence the claim that QL-implications never satisfy (IP) . Whereas, from the QL-implications IWB and IKP (see Example 4.21) we see that IT,S,N can satisfy (IP). 4.4. QL-implications and the ordering property From Proposition 4.7 and Remark 4.18(i) it is clear that if S is a positive t-conorm, then the QL-implication obtained from the triple (T, S, N) does not satisfy (OP). The following result gives a necessary condition for a QL-implication to satisfy (OP). Proposition 4.23. If a QL-implication IT,S,N obtained from a non-positive t-conorm S satis es (OP), then the negation N is strictly decreasing. 176 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Proof. To see this, if possible, let there exist x, y [0, 1] such that x < y but N(x) = N(y). By (OP) we have IT,S,N(x, y) = 1 S(N(x), T (x, y)) = 1 S(N(y), T (y, x)) = 1 IT,S,N(y, x) = 1 y x, a contradiction.  Note that, from Remark 4.6(iii), we require that N  NS, which implies that the natural negation NS of the t-conorm S should be non- lling, i.e., N(x) = 1 x = 0. From De nition 2.2, we see that this can happen only if every x (0, 1) has y (0, 1) such that S(x, y) = 1. Noting that a fuzzy implication that satis es (OP) also satis es (IP), using also Theorem 4.20, we summarize the above discussion in the following result. Theorem 4.24. If a QL-implication IT,S,N satis es (OP), then (i) T (x, x) NS N(x) for all x [0, 1]; (ii) N is a strictly decreasing negation; (iii) S is a non-positive t-conorm such that for every x (0, 1) there exists y (0, 1) such that S(x, y) = 1. Remark 4.25. (i) In fact, the QL-implication IKP obtained from the triple (TP, SLK, NK) (see Example 4.21) not only satis es (IP), but also as it can be easily veri ed (OP). (ii) The fact that the above conditions are not suf cient can be seen from Example 4.14 where the drastic sum t-conorm SD satis es condition (iii) of Theorem 4.24. Since NSD = ND1, if N is any strictly decreasing negation we have that N is non-vanishing and N > ND1 for all x (0, 1). Notice also that any t-norm T satis es condition (i) since ND1 N(x) = 0 for all x (0, 1). However, as can be seen from Example 4.14, the QL-implication IT,SD,N obtained from such a triple (T, SD, N) does not satisfy (OP). (iii) We only emphasize that point (iii) of Theorem 4.24 is different from the pair (S, N) satisfying (LEM), in that, for some x (0, 1) the N may be such that N(x) = 1, but the y in Theorem 4.24(iii) has to be in (0, 1). In the case, when the t-norm T = TM, we have the following stronger result. Theorem 4.26. Let S be a t-conorm and N a fuzzy negation such that the pair (S, N) satis es conditions in Theorem 4.24. Further, for a t-norm T, let IT,S,N be a QL-implication which satis es (OP). Then the following statements are equivalent: (i) T is the minimum t-norm TM. (ii) NS N = id[0,1]. Proof. Let the pair (S, N) satisfy conditions in Theorem 4.24 and, for a t-norm T, let IT,S,N FI satisfy (OP). (i) (ii) If T = TM, then the QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S, N) is the ITM,S,N given in Example 4.9. From (6) we see that x  y IT,S,N(x, y) = 1. The reverse implication is violated only if there exists y < x such that S(N(x), y) = 1. From Remark 2.10(iii), we know that for this to happen y  NS N(x). However, from Lemma 2.19(ii), we see that y [NS N(x), x). Now it is obvious that the reverse implication holds only if x = NS N(x). (ii) (i) Now, let NS N(x) = x for all x [0, 1]. Since IT,S,N satis es (OP), from Theorem 4.24(i), we have x = NS N(x)T (x, x)x which implies that T (x, x) = x for all x [0, 1], i.e., T is idempotent, or equivalently, T = TM.  Remark 4.27. (i) From Example 4.14, we see that with the positive t-norm T = TM, if N is both non-vanishing and NS N  id[0,1], then IT,S,N does not satisfy (OP). M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 177 (ii) Let S be a nilpotent t-conorm, i.e., -conjugate with the ukasiewicz t-conorm SLK. We know that the QL- implication obtained from the triple (T, (SLK), (NC)), where T is any t-norm, is I,T given by (7). Since NS = N = (NC) is a strong negation, from Theorems 4.26 and 4.20, we obtain the following result (cf. [21]). Corollary 4.28. For a QL-operation I,T given by (7), where T is any t-norm and  , the following statements are equivalent: (i) I,T satis es (IP). (ii) I,T satis es (OP). (iii) T = TM. Remark 4.29. The QL-implication IKP in Example 4.21 shows that in the case N  (NC) in Corollary 4.28, there do exist t-norms T other than TM such that the QL-implication obtained from the triple (T, (SLK), N) satis es (OP). 4.5. QL-implications and the law of contraposition Since every QL-operation satis es (NP) (see Proposition 4.2), it is immediate from Lemma 3.7, that if IT,S,N satis es CP(N), then N = NI is strong. If S is a positive t-conorm, from Proposition 4.7 we see that a QL-operation IT,S,N is a fuzzy implication if and only if N = ND2, which is a non-strong negation. In fact, the QL-implication in this case is the Weber implication IWB, which does not satisfy (CP) with any negation N. Once again, if the QL-implication is obtained from the triple (T, S, N) where N is not strong, then by Lemma 3.8 we see that it does not satisfy (CP) with any fuzzy negation N. Of course, if N is strong and IT,S,N satis es (EP), then by Lemma 3.9(ii), we have that IT,S,N satis es CP(N). Let S be a nilpotent t-conorm. Then it is non-positive, continuous and is -conjugate with the ukasiewicz t-conorm SLK. Consider, once again, the QL-implication I,T given by (7) and obtained from the triple (T, (SLK), (NC)). Since (NC) is strong, we know that I,T satis es (CP) only with (NC). Now we have the following result rstly obtained by Fodor [11]. Theorem 4.30. For a QL-operation I,T given by (7), where T is any t-norm and  , the following statements are equivalent: (i) I,T satis es CP((NC)). (ii) T belongs to the family of Frank t-norms T  F . We also have the following result which is stronger than the original result of Fodor [11, Theorem 5]. Theorem 4.31. For the QL-implication IT,SN nM,N the following statements are equivalent: (i) IT,SN nM,N satis es (CP) with some fuzzy negation N . (ii) N = N is strong and T = TM. Proof. (i) (ii) Let IT,SN nM,N satisfy (CP) with some fuzzy negation N . Since any QL-implication satis es (NP), from Lemma 3.7 we see that N = N and is a strong negation. The rest of the proof is very much along the lines given in [11, Theorem 5]. (ii) (i) In the case T = TM we have that the QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, SN nM, N) is as given in (9) with N = N. By a straightforward veri cation we see that ITM,SN nM,N indeed satis es CP(N).  5. (S,N)-implications and R-implications In this section we introduce the two most established families of fuzzy implications, viz., (S,N)- and R-implications by giving their de nitions, some examples, the conditions under which they satisfy the desirable algebraic properties and the relevant characterization/representation results. Following this, we give some results pertaining to the intersections that exist between these families. 178 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Table 7 Examples of basic (S,N)-implications S N (S,N)-implication IS,N SM NC IKD SP NC IRC SLK NC ILK SD NC IDP SnM NC IFD Any S ND1 ID(x, y) =  1 if x = 0 y if x > 0 Any S ND2 IWB 5.1. (S,N)-implications De nition 5.1 (cf. Trillas and Valverde [31], Fodor and Roubens [10], Alsina and Trillas [1], Baczy nski and Jayaram [3]). A function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called an (S,N)-implication if there exist a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N such that I(x, y) = S(N(x), y), x, y [0, 1]. If N is a strong negation, then I is called a strong implication or S-implication. Moreover, if I is an (S,N)-implication generated from S and N, then we will often denote it by IS,N. Example 5.2. Table 7 lists a few well-known (S,N)-implications along with their t-conorms and negations from which they have been obtained. Remark 5.3 (see Trillas and Valverde [31], Baczy nski and Jayaram [3]). (i) All (S,N)-implications are fuzzy implications which satisfy (NP) and (EP). (ii) If I is an (S,N)-implication obtained from a fuzzy negation N, then N = NI. (iii) Because of Corollary 3.10 we get that an (S,N)-implication I satis es CP(N) with some fuzzy negation N if and only if N = NI is a strong negation, i.e., I is an S-implication. Not all (S,N)-implications satisfy the identity principle (IP) or the ordering property (OP), see, for example IRC and IKD. An equivalence condition under which (S,N)-implications satisfy them are given by the following results. Lemma 5.4 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Lemma 4.5]). For a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N the following state- ments are equivalent: (i) The (S,N)-implication IS,N satis es (IP). (ii) The pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). Theorem 5.5 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Theorem 4.7]). For a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N the following state- ments are equivalent: (i) The (S,N)-implication IS,N satis es (OP). (ii) N = NS is a strong negation and the pair (S, NS) satis es (LEM). The following characterization of (S,N)-implications is from [2], which is an extension of a result in [30]. M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 179 Table 8 Examples of basic R-implications t-norm T R-implication IT TM IGD TP IGG TLK ILK TD IWB TnM IFD Theorem 5.6. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is an (S,N)-implication generated from some t-conorm S and some continuous (strict, strong) fuzzy negation N. (ii) I satis es (I2), (EP) and the function NI is a continuous (strict, strong) fuzzy negation. Remark 5.7. (i) The representations of (S,N)-implications in the above theorem is unique. (ii) In Theorem 5.6 we can substitute the axiom (I2) by (I1). 5.2. R-implications De nition 5.8 (cf. Trillas and Valverde [31], Fodor and Roubens [10], Gottwald [12]). Afunction I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called an R-implication, if there exists a t-norm T such that I(x, y) = sup{t [0, 1] | T (x, t) y}, x, y [0, 1]. If I is an R-implication generated from a t-norm T, then we will often denote it by IT . Example 5.9. Table 8 lists a few well-known R-implications along with their t-norms from which they have been obtained. Theorem 5.10 (cf. Fodor and Roubens [10], Gottwald [12]). If T is any t-norm (not necessarily left-continuous), then IT FI. Moreover, IT satis es (NP) and (IP). Theorem 5.11 (Fodor and Roubens [10, Theorem 1.14]). For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is an R-implication based on some left-continuous t-norm T. (ii) I satis es (I2), (OP), (EP) and I(x, ) is right-continuous for any xed x [0, 1]. Remark 5.12. It can be immediately noted that NT ( ) = IT ( , 0), where IT is obtained from a t-norm T. From Theorem 5.11 and Corollary 3.6, we see that for a left-continuous t-norm T, the fuzzy negation NT is either strong or discontinuous. 5.3. Intersections between (S,N)- and R-implications The following results are from Baczy nski and Jayaram [4]. Theorem 5.13 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Theorem 6.2]). For a left-continuous t-norm T, a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N the following statements are equivalent: (i) The R-implication IT is also an (S,N)-implication IS,N, i.e., IT = IS,N. (ii) N = NT is a strong negation and (T, N, S) form a De Morgan triple. 180 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Theorem 5.14 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [4, Theorem 6.5]). For a right-continuous t-conorm S and a t-norm T the following statements are equivalent: (i) The (S,N)-implication IS,NS is also the R-implication IT . (ii) (S, NS, T ) form a De Morgan triple. Let us denote by IS,N the family of all (S,N)-implications; IS the family of all S-implications, i.e., (S,N)-implications where N is a strong negation; IS ,N S the family of all (S,N)-implications obtained from right-continuous t-conorms and their natural negations which are strong; IT the family of all R-implications; ITLC the family of all R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms; IT the family of all R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms having strong induced negations; INT(T),NT the family of all (S,N)-implications obtained from the NT -dual of the left-continuous t-norm T whose natural negation NT is strong. As a consequence of the presented facts, the following equalities hold: IS ITLC = IS,N ITLC = INT(T),NT = IT = IS ,N S. Note, that as yet, it is only known that IWB IS,N IT. A complete characterization of the intersection of these classes is still an open problem. 6. Intersections between (S,N)- and QL-implications Let us denote by IQL the family of all QL-implications. Firstly, note that if the t-conorm S is positive, the following result is obvious from Proposition 4.7. Theorem 6.1. The QL-implication IT,S,N, where S is a positive t-conorm, is an (S,N)-implication. In fact, IT,S,N = IWB. Hence IS,N IQL  . The following result shows that if a QL-operation IT,S,N is obtained from a triple (T, S, N), where N is a continuous negation, then it being an (S,N)-implication is equivalent to IT,S,N satis es (EP). We give a slightly more general result than was shown by Mas et al. [21]. Theorem 6.2 (cf. Mas et al. [21, Proposition 8]). For a QL-implication IT,S,N, with a continuous negation N, the following statements are equivalent: (i) IT,S,N satis es (EP). (ii) IT,S,N is an (S,N)-implication generated from N. Proof. (i) (ii) Let IT,S,N be a QL-implication with N a continuous negation. Firstly, observe that IT,S,N satis es (I2) and NIT,S,N = N is a continuous negation. If IT,S,N satis es (EP), then by virtue of Theorem 5.6 and Remark 5.7(ii), the function IT,S,N is an (S,N)-implication generated from N. (ii) (i) The reverse implication is obvious and follows from Remark 5.3(i).  M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 181 Remark 6.3. (i) When N is a strict negation in Theorem 6.2, then IT,S,N is an (S,N)-implication generated from N and a t-conorm S given by S (x, y) = S(x, T (N 1(x), y)). (ii) Theorem 6.2 also gives a suf cient condition for a QL-operation obtained from the triple (T, S, N) with a continuous negation N to be a fuzzy implication. (iii) However, the QL-implications IWB and IT,SD,N (see Example 4.14), with any N that is discontinuous but non- vanishing, show that the continuity of N is not necessary for QL-operation to satisfy (EP). (iv) It is interesting to note that both IWB and IT,SD,N, under the conditions of Example 4.14, are also (S,N)- implications. While IWB is an (S,N)-implication obtained from any t-conorm S and N = ND2, i.e., IWB = IS,ND2, the QL-implication IT,SD,N is the (S,N)-implication ISD,N. In the case, when T is the minimum t-norm TM, we have the following stronger results. Proposition 6.4. Let S be a t-conorm and N a fuzzy negation such that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). Then the QL- operation ITM,S,N is also an (S,N)-implication obtained from the same t-conorm S and negation N, i.e., ITM,S,N = IS,N. In other words, IS,N can be represented as a QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S, N). Proof. Consider the QL-operation generated from the minimum t-norm TM, a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N such that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). Then ITM,S,N is a fuzzy implication given by (6). On the one hand, if x  y, then IT,S,N(x, y) = S(N(x), TM(x, y)) = S(N(x), x) = 1 and IS,N(x, y) = S(N(x), y) S(N(x), x) = 1. On the other hand, if x > y, then IT,S,N(x, y) = S(N(x), y) = IS,N(x, y).  Remark 6.5. In the above Proposition 6.4 the condition that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM) is essential. Otherwise, the QL-operation may not be a fuzzy implication, as can be seen for IZD in Remark 4.3. From [16, Proposition 2.31] we know that (TM) = TM for all  , from whence we have the following result. Corollary 6.6. The -conjugate of the QL-implication ITM,S,N is also the (S,N)-implication generated from the -conjugate t-conorm of S and the -conjugate fuzzy negation of N, i.e., if  , then (ITM,S,N)(x, y) = IS,N(x, y), x, y [0, 1]. As an interesting consequence of the above fact we obtain the following characterizations of some special classes of QL-implications. Theorem 6.7. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is a QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S, N) with a continuous negation N. (ii) I satis es (I2), (IP), (EP) and NI is a continuous negation. Proof. (i) (ii) From Proposition 6.4 we see that I is an (S,N)-implication obtained from the t-conorm S and the continuous negation N. Hence it satis es (I2) and (EP) too. Since I is a QL-implication we know that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM) and hence, by Lemma 5.4 I satis es (IP). (ii) (i) Since I satis es (I2), (EP) and NI is a continuous negation, I is an (S,N)-implication obtained from some t-conorm S and N = NI. Consider the QL-operation J obtained from the triple (TM, S, N) with N = NI and the above S. Since I satis es (IP), once again by Lemma 5.4, we know that the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). Now with T = TM we know from Proposition 6.4, that J is the (S,N)-implication obtained from the above t-conorm S and N = NI, i.e., J = I.  182 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 Theorem 6.8. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is a QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S, NS) where NS is a strong negation and the pair (S, NS) satis es (LEM). (ii) I satis es (I2), (OP), (EP) and NI is a strong negation. Proof. (i) (ii) From Proposition 6.4 we see that I = IS,NS, the (S,N)-implication obtained from the t-conorm S and the strong negation NS. Hence it satis es (I2) and (EP). Moreover, NI = NIS,NS = NS is a strong negation. Finally, from Theorem 5.5 we see that I satis es (OP). (ii) (i) Since I satis es (I2), (EP) and NI is a strong negation it is an S-implication obtained from the t-conorm S(x, y) = I(NI (x), y) and N = NI. Once again, from Theorem 5.5 we see that N = NI = NS and the pair (S, NS) satis es (LEM). Consider the QL-operation J obtained from the triple (TM, S, NS). From Proposition 6.4, we get that J is the (S,N)-implication obtained from the above t-conorm S and N = NS, i.e., J = I.  Corollary 6.9. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is a QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S, NS) where S is a right-continuous t-conorm and NS is a strong negation. (ii) I satis es (I2), (OP), (EP), I is right-continuous in the second variable and NI is a strong negation. Proof. (i) (ii) Since S is right-continuous from Proposition 2.12(iv) we have that the pair (S, NS) satis es (LEM). Then, from Theorem 6.8, we see that I satis es (I2), (OP), (EP) and NI is a strong negation. Obviously, I is right- continuous in the second variable. (ii) (i) Since I is right-continuous in the second variable and S(x, y) = I(NI(x), y) we have that S is also right- continuous in the second variable. But S is also a t-conorm in this case, so S is right-continuous. Once again, from Theorem 6.8 the rest of the proof is obvious.  Theorem 6.10. Let IT,S,N be a QL-implication, where S is a non-positive t-conorm with strong induced negation NS. Consider the following statements: (i) IT,S,N is an (S,N)-implication obtained from the same S and N, i.e., IT,S,N = IS,N. (ii) N = NS. (iii) T = TM. Then the following relationships exist among the above statements: (i) and (ii) (iii); (ii) and (iii) (i). Proof. Firstly, note that if IT,S,N FI, then by virtue of Lemma 4.5 the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM). (i) and (ii) (iii) We know that for any t-norm T (x, x)x for all x [0, 1]. Moreover, for any x (0, 1), we have NS(x)  1. Let us assume that IT,S,NS = IS,NS for some non-positive t-conorm S with strong natural negation NS and some t-norm T. Then S(NS(x), T (x, x)) = S(NS(x), x) = 1, for all x [0, 1], since the pair (S, NS) satis es (LEM). From Remark 2.10(iii), we obtain T (x, x) NS NS(x) = x, from whence we obtain T (x, x) = x, for all x [0, 1], i.e., T = TM. (ii) and (iii) (i) Since the pair (S, N) satis es (LEM), this follows from Proposition 6.4.  Remark 6.11. Let us consider a t-conorm S whose natural negation NS is discontinuous. Note that, in this remark, by points (i) (iii) we refer to the items described in Theorem 6.10. From Proposition 6.4, we always have that (iii) (i). Let us de ne a lenient version of (i) as follows: (i ) IT,S,N is an (S,N)-implication obtained from a (possibly different) t-conorm S and a negation N , i.e., IT,S,N = IS ,N . Then, from Table 9, the following observations can be made: (a) From the rst entry, we notice that N = NS is not strong and IT,S,N = IS,N, but T  TM, i.e., (i) and (ii) / (iii), when N is not strong. Note that the t-conorm SP can be replaced by any positive t-conorm. M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 183 Table 9 Some QL-implications that are also (S,N)-implications S T N NS IT,S,N SP Any T ND2 ND2 IWB SB TM ND2 NSB IWB SD TM NC ND1 IDP SLK TLK NC NC IKD SLK TP NC NC IRC (b) From the second and third entries, it is clear that even if IT,S,N = IS,N and T = TM we can have NS  N, i.e., (i) and (iii) / (ii), when N is not strong. Note that the t-conorm SB and its natural negation NSB are given as follows: SB(x, y) =  1 if (x, y) (0.5, 1)2, max(x, y) otherwise, x, y [0, 1], NSB(x) = 1 if x [0, 0.5), 0.5 if x [0.5, 1), 0 if x = 1, x [0, 1]. (c) From the fourth and fth entries, we see that IT,S,N = IS ,N and N = N = NC, a strong negation, but T  TM, i.e., (i ) and (ii) / (iii). Let us denote by IS,NS the family of all (S,N)-implications obtained from t-conorms and their natural negations; IS, N the family of all (S,N)-implications, where N is greater than or equal to the natural negation obtained from S, i.e., N  NS. Summarizing the above discussion, we get IS ,N SIS,NSIS, NIQL. The following examples illustrate the above chain of inclusions. ILK, IFD IS ,N SIQL. IWB IS,NS \ IS ,N SIQL. IDP IS, N \ IS,NSIQL. IKD, IRC IQL \ IS, N. The QL-implications IPC, IPR from Example 4.13 and IKP from Example 4.21 do not satisfy the exchange principle (EP) and hence are not (S,N)-implications, i.e., IPC, IPR, IKP IQL \ IS,N. Similarly, the fuzzy implication ID (see Table 7) is an (S,N)-implication obtained from the least negation ND1 and hence, by Remark 4.6(i), it is not a QL-implication, i.e., ID IS,N \ IQL. 7. Intersections between R- and QL-implications Firstly, if S is a positive t-conorm or if N = ND2, then the QL-implication IT,S,N is the R-implication IWB obtained from the non-left-continuous t-norm TD. Hence IQL IT  . 184 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 A complete characterization of the above intersection is as yet unknown. However, as we show below, the exact intersection of the family of QL-implications IQL with the family of R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms ITLC can be precisely determined. Proposition 7.1. If a QL-implication IT,S,N is an R-implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm T , then (i) N = NT is strong; (ii) IT,S,N is also an S-implication obtained from a t-conorm S , such that S is the N-dual of T , and N = NS , i.e., IT,S,N = IS ,NS . Proof. Let a QL-implication obtained from the triple (T, S, N) also be an R-implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm T , i.e., let IT,S,N = IT . (i) From Theorem 5.11, we see that IT satis es both (EP) and (OP). Now, from Propositions 4.23 and 3.6, we get that N = NIT,S,N = NIT = NT , is either strong or discontinuous but strictly decreasing. However, we know from Corollary 2.15, that the natural negation NT of a (left-continuous) t-norm T , if discontinuous, is not strictly decreasing. Hence N = NT is strong. (ii) Since IT,S,N satis es (EP), Theorem 6.2 implies that IT,S,N is also an S-implication IS ,N for some t-conorm S , i.e., IT,S,N = IS ,N = IT . Now, from Theorem 5.13, we see that (T , S , N) forms a De Morgan triple, i.e., S is the N-dual of T and that N = NS .  Theorem 7.2. For a function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is both a QL-implication obtained from the triple (T, S, N) and an R-implication obtained from some left- continuous t-norm T . (ii) I can be represented as a QL-implication obtained from (TM, S , NS ), where S is a right-continuous t-conorm with a strong natural negation NS . (iii) I is both an (S,N)- and an R-implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm. Proof. (i) (ii) Let I = IT,S,N = IT . From Proposition 7.1, we have that N = NIT = NT is strong and I = IS ,N, where S is the right-continuous t-conorm that is the N-dual of T . Moreover, N = NT = NS . Now, since S is right-continuous, by Proposition 2.22, we see that the pair (S , NS ) indeed satis es (LEM). Further, by Proposition 6.4, we see that IS ,NS can also be represented as a QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S , NS ), i.e., I = IT = IS ,NS = ITM,S ,NS . (ii) (iii) Firstly, from Proposition 6.4, we see that such a QL-implication is also an (S,N)-implication. In fact, we have ITM,S ,NS = IS ,NS . Since S is a right-continuous t-conorm with a strong natural negation NS , we see that (S , NS , T ) form a De Morgan triple, where T is the left-continuous t-norm which is NS -dual of S . Now, from Theorem 5.14, we see that IS ,NS is also the R-implication obtained from T , i.e., IS ,NS = IT . (iii) (i) If I is both an (S,N)- and an R-implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm, then we know, from Theorem 5.13, that (T, S, NT = NS) form a De Morgan triple and I = IS,NS = IT . Once again, invoking Proposition 6.4, we see that IS,NS can also be represented as a QL-implication obtained from the triple (TM, S, NS), i.e., I = IT = IS,NS = ITM,S,NS.  From Theorem 7.2, we see that IQL ITLC = ITLC IS,N = IQL ITLC IS,N = IS ,N S = IT .

(i) Consider the R-implication obtained from the t-norm TB given in Example 2.13, which is given as follows: ITB(x, y) = 1 if x  y, 0.5 if x > y and x [0, 0.5), y otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. It is clear that ITB satis es (OP) but its natural negation NITB = NTB given in Example 2.13 is not strictly decreasing and hence, by Proposition 4.23, we have that ITB is not a QL-implication. For the same reason the Goguen implication IGG cannot be obtained as a QL-implication for any triple (T, S, N). (ii) Consider the QL-implications IPC, IPR from Example 4.13. Since they do not satisfy (IP), from Theorem 5.10 we see that they cannot be represented as R-implications of any t-norm. Let us now consider the QL-implication IKP in Example 4.21. Since a QL-operation is generated by a unique negation (see Proposition 4.2(ii)), if IKP is also an R-implication IT obtained from some t-norm T, then NIKP = NK = NIT = NT . However, NK is a strict negation that is not involutive, hence by Corollary 2.15, we see that IKP cannot be an R-implication. To summarize, we have the following facts: IPC, IPR, IKP IQL \ IT, IWB IQL \ ITLC, ITB IT \ IQL, IGG ITLC \ IQL. The results presented in this section are also diagrammatically represented in Fig. 3. 8. Intersections between Yager s and QL-implications Recently, Yager [32] introduced two new classes of fuzzy implications from the additive generators of t-norms and t-conorms called f- and g-implications, respectively. We only give the relevant results here. For more details, we refer the readers to Yager [32] and Baczy nski and Jayaram [2]. 186 M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 De nition 8.1 (Yager [32, p. 197]). Let f : [0, 1] [0, ] be a strictly decreasing and continuous function with f (1) = 0. The function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] de ned by I(x, y) = f 1(x f (y)), x, y [0, 1], (10) with the understanding 0 = 0, is called an f-generated implication. The function f itself is called an f-generator of the I generated as in (10). In such a case, to emphasize the apparent relation we will write I f instead of I. De nition 8.2 (Yager [32, p. 202]). Let g: [0, 1] [0, ] be a strictly increasing and continuous function with g(0) = 0. The function I: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] de ned by I(x, y) = g( 1) 1 x g(y)  , x, y [0, 1], (11) with the understanding 1/0 = and 0 = , is called a g-generated implication, where the function g( 1) in (11) is the pseudo-inverse of g given by g( 1)(x) =  g 1(x) if x [0, g(1)], 1 if x [g(1), ]. The function g itself is called a g-generator of the I generated as in (11). Once again, we will write Ig instead of I. Proposition 8.3 (Baczy nski and Jayaram [2, Propositions 2 and 4]). (i) If an f-generator is such that f (0) = , then the natural negation of I f is the G del negation ND1, which is non-continuous. (ii) If g is a g-generator, then the natural negation of Ig is the G del negation ND1, which is not continuous. Let us denote by IF, the family of all f-generated implications such that f (0) = ; IG the family of all g-generated implications. Unfortunately, there does not exist any complete characterization of the family of QL-implications. Interestingly, some results can still be proven regarding the intersections between QL-implications and IF, , IG. From Remark 4.6(i), we see that if the natural negation NI of a fuzzy implication I is the G del negation ND1, then I is not a QL-implication. Now, from Proposition 8.3(i) and (ii), we have the following result. Theorem 8.4. If I is either (i) a g-implication obtained from a g-generator, or (ii) an f-implication obtained from an f-generator with f (0) = , then I is not a QL-implication. Summarizing the above results we have IF, IQL = , IG IQL = . 9. Concluding remarks In this paper, we have systematically studied the class of QL-implications without imposing any conditions on the underlying operations. Firstly, we have shown that not all QL-operations are fuzzy implications and have M. Baczy nski, B. Jayaram / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 161 (2010) 158 188 187 given some necessary/suf cient conditions to this end. However, the following question, as yet, remains unsolved: Problem 9.1. Characterize triples (T, S, N) such that IT,S,N satis es (I1). Following this, we have discussed the conditions under which this family satis es some desirable algebraic properties. However, only some necessary conditions are known for a QL-implication to satisfy (OP) and hence we have the following: Problem 9.2. What extra suf cient condition(s) should we impose, other than the ones in Theorem 4.24, so that the QL-implication obtained from the triple (T, S, N) satis es (OP)? Although Theorem 6.2 gives an equivalence condition for a QL-implication IT,S,N, with a continuous negation N, to satisfy (EP), it is obvious that its utility is quite limited. Nevertheless, all the examples, so far, seem to point that a QL-implication that satis es (EP) also turns out to be an (S,N)-implication. The answers to the following posers will be of immense help in resolving the exact intersection between families of (S,N)- and QL-implications. Problem 9.3. (i) Is Theorem 6.2 true even when N is not continuous, i.e., is any QL-implication IT,S,N that satis es (EP) also an (S,N)-implication? (ii) If not, give a counter-example and hence obtain an alternate necessary and suf cient condition for a QL-implication IT,S,N to satisfy (EP). Based on the obtained results and existing characterization results, the intersections between QL-implications and the two most established families of fuzzy implications, viz., (S,N)- and R-implications have been determined. It is shown that QL-implications contain the set of all R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms that are also (S,N)-implications. However, it is not yet clear if there is a QL-implication which can be represented as an R-implication of some non-left-continuous t-norm, but which is not an (S,N)-implication. Note that Theorem 7.2 assumes the left- continuity of the t-norm T (see Fig. 3). The overlaps between QL-implications and the recently proposed f- and g-implications have also been studied. In this context, denoting the family of all f-generated implications with f (0) < by IF, , the following questions remain to be solved. Problem 9.4. (i) Characterize the non-empty intersection IS,N IQL. (ii) Is the Weber implication IWB the only QL-implication that is also an R-implication obtained from a non-left continuous t-norm? If not, give other examples from the above intersection and hence, characterize the non-empty intersection IQL IT. (iii) Prove or disprove by giving an example: (IQL IT) \ IS,N = . (iv) Is the intersection IF, IQL non-empty? If yes, then characterize the intersection IF, IQL. References [1] C. Alsina, E.
