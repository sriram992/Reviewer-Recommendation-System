IEEE Proof IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 12, NO. 2, APRIL 2004 1 On the Distributivity of Implication Operators Over T and S Norms J. Balasubramaniam, Student Member, IEEE and C. Jagan Mohan Rao Abstract In this paper, we explore the distributivity of impli- cation operators (especially PLEASE DEFINE R R- and Sugeno (S)-implication) over Takagi (T)- and S-norms. The motivation be- hind this work is the on going discussion on the law [( ) ] [( ) ( )] in fuzzy logic as given in the title of the paper by Trillas and Alsina. The above law is only one of the four basic distributive laws. The general form of the previous distribu- tive law is ( ( ) ) ( ( ) ( )). Similarly, the other three basic distributive laws can be generalized to give equa- tions concerning distribution of fuzzy implications on T- and S- norms. In this paper, we study the validity of these equations under various conditions on the implication operator . We also propose some sufficiency conditions on a binary operator under which the general distributive equations are reduced to the basic distributive equations and are satisfied. Also in this work, we have solved one of the open problems posed by M. Baczynski (2002). Index Terms Distributivity, fuzzy implication, fuzzy logic, Sugeno (S)-norms, Takagi (T)-norms. I. INTRODUCTION R ECENTLY, there has been a lot of discussion [1] [6] cen- tred around a paper by Combs and Andrews [1] where they attempt to exploit the equivalence (1) toward eliminating combinatorial rule explosion in fuzzy sys- tems. (1) is only one of four such equations as listed in [7], which deals with the distributivity of Implication operators with respect to Takagi (T)- and Sugeno (S)-norms, the rest of them being (2) (3) (4) In [6], Trillas and Alsina have investigated the conditions under which the following general form of (1): (5) holds for the main four different types of implication operators, viz., R-, S-, QL-, and ML-implications, where and denote Manuscript received October 15, 2002; revised July 22, 2003.

The generalizations of (2) (4) are as follows: (6) (7) (8) The general forms of these equations have a role in lossless rule reduction for Control/Expert systems in Fuzzy Logic. Work on these lines has appeared in [8]. The (7) has been discussed in [9] under the assumption that is a strict -norm and the implication is continuous except at (0, 0). In this paper, we study the validity of the above (2) (4) under various conditions. We propose some sufficiency conditions on a binary operator under which the general distributive equations (5) (8) are reduced to the basic distributive equations and are satisfied. Also in this paper, we have solved one of the open problems posed by Baczynski [10]. A. Few Definitions To make this paper self-contained, we briefly mention some of the concepts and results employed in the rest of the paper.

Definition 5: An -implication is obtained from an -norm and a strong negation as follows: . Definition 6: An -implication is obtained from a -norm as its residuation as follows: . II. ON THE GENERAL FORMS OF (1) (4) In this section, we consider each of the general forms (5) (8) of the basic distributive equations (1) (4). A. On the Equation (5) In [6], it is shown that (5) reduces to (9) under any of the implication operators R-,S-, QL-, and ML-implications (9) i.e., , in (5). Interpreting as S-, R-, or a QL- impli- cation reduces (9) to (10) (10) i.e., . Also it is shown that all R- and S- implications satisfy (10) which is (5) with and , but only a certain restricted class of QL-implications satisfy (10). Also, ML-implications do not satisfy (10), but if in (5) then interpreted as an ML-implication satisfies the following law: (11) Due to these results, in the remaining part of this work we will be concerned with only R- and S-implications, the implication operators for which (5) always holds. B. On the Equation (6) Letting , we have (12) We know that , for S- and R- implications. Thus, we have from (12), . This implies , the only idempotent t-norm. Thus, (6) reduces to (13) in the case of R- and S-implications (13) Also, (6) can be shown to reduce to (13) for QL- and ML-im- plications. Let us investigate (13) separately for S- implications and R-implications. 1) Case I: S-Implications: Let be an S-implication ob- tained from an S-norm and a strong negation as follows: We know . Taking in (13), we have the dual of min. Also LHS of (13) RHS of (13) (14) where is an S-implication. Thus, (14) holds for all S-impli- cations. 2) Case II: R-Implications: Let be an R-implication given by a t-norm as follows: (15) Now, letting in (13) we have (16) Since is an s-norm, . If for some then for this . Then, from (16) we have (17) However, being an R-implication has the identity principle, i.e., , and thus and therefore , which is not true since this would imply . Therefore, , i.e., . This implies , the only idempotent s-norm. Thus, (13) reduces to (18) when is an R-implication (18) We know in a Residuated Lattice , for the adjoin couple we have (19) where is an R-implication obtained from the t-norm . The left-hand side of (18), using (19), becomes Since is arbitrary, we have (18). Thus, (18) holds for all R-implications. IEEE Proof BALASUBRAMANIAM AND RAO: ON THE DISTRIBUTIVITY OF IMPLICATION OPERATORS 3 In the rest of this paper, so as to use an unobtrusive notation and since the context itself will make it clear, we will denote by both an S- and an R-implication. C. On the Equation (7) Let us consider S- and R-implications for the (7). We know for any S- and R-implication, . Putting in (7), we get i.e., . Hence on . Thus, (7) becomes (20) 1) Case I: S-Implication: Taking in (20) we obtain (21) We know that for S-implications , thus (21) becomes . Since is a strong negation, we have that . Hence, . (20) now becomes (22) Also LHS of (22) by distributivity of over RHS of (22) Thus, (22) holds for all S-implications. 2) Case II: R-Implication: Let . Then there exist and such that . Let be so chosen that . Now, LHS of (20) . RHS of (20) , by the identity principle of R-implications, i.e., . Thus, LHS of (20) , which again by the iden- tity principle implies , a contradiction to our as- sumption. Therefore, we see that when is an R-implication and (20) reduces to (23) We have to show that when is an R-implication (23) holds. Again, by the definition of a residuated lattice, we have Since is arbitrary, we have (23). Thus, (23) holds for all R-implications. In [10], the following was posed as an open problem. Open Problem 2 [10]: What is the solution of the functional equation (24) when is a given fuzzy implication, for example, R-implication or S-implication? As can be seen, (24) is only a special case of (7), when . D. On the Equation (8) We know for any S- and R-implication, . Putting in (8), we get , i.e., . Hence, on . Thus, (8) becomes (25) 1) Case I: S-Implications: Taking in (25) we obtain, . We know that for S-implications , thus we have from above . Again, since is a strong negation, we have that . Hence, . (25) now becomes (26) Further, it can be shown (as has been shown for (22) in II.C.1) that if is an S-implication then it satisfies (26). 2) Case II: R-Implications: We know that if is an R-im- plication obtained from a nilpotent t-norm then is contin- uous in both the variables [11]. We also have that and and since is continuous takes all values in when the second coordinate of is fixed, i.e., . Then, (25) becomes the only idempotent s-norm. From this discussion, the following results arise. Theorem 1: An S-implication or an R-implication satisfies (5) if and only if and . Theorem 2: An S-implication or an R-implication satisfies (6) if and only if and . Theorem 3: An S-implication or an R-implication satisfies (7) if and only if . Theorem 4: An S-implication or an R-implication obtained from a nilpotent t-norm satisfies (8) if and only if . Even though the proof of reduction of (8) to (4) has been given for the case where the R-implication was obtained from a nilpotent t-norm, the authors have a strong feeling that it holds for the case when the R-implication is obtained from a strict t-norm, and that Theorem 4 will hold for any R-implication.

SOME SUFFICIENCY CONDITIONS ON THE GENERAL FORMS OF THE DISTRIBUTIVE EQUATIONS In this section, we consider the general equations (5) (8) and propose sufficiency conditions on a binary operator that reduces them to (1) (4), the basic distributive equations. A. On the Equation (5) Let be a binary operator from . Then, we have the following propositions. Proposition 1: If J satisfies neutrality, i.e., , then . Proof: in (5) reduces it to , which implies . Hence, , the only idempotent s-norm. Proposition 2: If satisfies the neutrality principle and is one-to-one in the first variable, then in (5). Proof: As shown by neutrality of , (5) becomes . Letting in the above equation with a fixed , we have, , i.e., , which implies , since is one-to-one in the first variable. Hence, , the only idempotent t-norm. Proposition 3: A binary operator is nonincreasing in the first variable if and only if satisfies (27) which is nothing but (1). Proof: Let be nonincreasing in the first variable, i.e., . Then the two sides of (27) are equal. On the other hand, let satisfy (27) and let for any . Then from (27) we have, , which implies , i.e., is nonincreasing in the first variable. From the definition of an implication operator and the afore- mentioned propositions, we have the following. Theorem 5: Any implication operator that is one-to-one in the first variable reduces (5) to (1) and satisfies (1). B. On the Equation (6) Let be a binary operator from to . Then, we have the following propositions, the proofs of which can be obtained as in Section III-A. Proposition 4: If satisfies neutrality, i.e., then . Proposition 5: If satisfies the neutrality principle and is one-to-one in the first variable, then in (6). Proposition 6: A binary operator is nonincreasing in the first variable if and only if satisfies (28) which is nothing but (2). From the definition of an implication operator and the afore- mentioned propositions, we have the following. Theorem 6: Any implication operator that is one-to-one in the first variable reduces (6) to (2) and satisfies (2). C. On the Equation (7) Let be a binary operator from . Then, we have the following propositions. Proposition 7: If satisfies the neutrality principle, i.e., then on . Proof: Taking in (7) we have, , which implies . Hence, on . Proposition 8: If is neutral and onto in the first variable, then in (7). Proof: As shown before, by the neutrality of we have on in (7), i.e., (29) Let , then from (29) we have, . Since is onto in the first vari- able, . Hence, from above, , which implies . Proposition 9: A binary operator is nondecreasing in the second variable if and only if satisfies (30) (30) which is nothing but (3). Proof: Proof is similar to that of Proposition 3. From the definition of an Implication operator and the above propositions, we have the following: Theorem 7: Any implication operator that is onto in the first variable reduces (7) to (3) and satisfies (3). D. On the Equation (8) Let be a binary operator from to . Then, we have the following propositions,the proofs of which can be obtained as in Section III-C. Proposition 10: If satisfies the neutrality principle, i.e., then on . Proposition 11: If is neutral and onto in the first variable then in (8). Proposition 12: A binary operator is nondecreasing in the second variable if and only if satisfies (31) (31) which is nothing but (4). From the definition of an implication operator and the above propositions, we have the following: Theorem 8: Any implication operator that is onto in the first variable reduces (8) to (4) and satisfies (4). IV. CONCLUSION It may be noted that a fuzzy implication will be of the form If X is A, then Y is B, where X and Y are the variables and A and B are fuzzy sets on the domain of X and Y, respectively. The implication is represented as and often as . It is common in fuzzy control to have two different antecedents (observations) leading to the same consequent (ac- tion). The two rules may be joined by else or and. These IEEE Proof BALASUBRAMANIAM AND RAO: ON THE DISTRIBUTIVITY OF IMPLICATION OPERATORS 5 lead to the RHS of (1) and (2) respectively. The the left-hand side of these equations reduce these to a single rule. Similarly, in the case of fuzzy expert systems, it is possible that one antecedent (symptom) may lead to different consequents (diseases). These lead to the right-hand side of (3) and (4). The left-hand side of these equations once again enable reduction in number of rules. The advantage of this rule reduction is lossless inferencing, i.e., the inferences drawn from the original system and the reduced system are the same. It is quite satisfying to note that all S-impli- cations and R-implications have this property. The requirement on any binary operator to satisfy these equations is also not too stringent. The discussion in this work is on the framework of single-input single-output fuzzy systems, but can be extended in an obvious way to multiple-input single-output systems.
