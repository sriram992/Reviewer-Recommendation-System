ABSTRACT Among various palmprint identi cation methods proposed in the literature, sparse representa- tion for classi cation (SRC) is very attractive offering high accuracy. Although SRC has good discriminative ability, its performance strongly depends on the quality of the training data. In particular, SRC suffers from two major problems: lack of training samples per class and large intra-class variations. In fact, palmprint images not only contain identity information but they also have other information, such as illumination and geometrical distortions due to the unconstrained conditions and the movement of the hand. In this case, the sparse representation assumption may not hold well in the original space since samples from different classes may be considered from the same class. This paper aims to enhance palmprint identi cation performance through SRC by proposing a simple yet ef cient method based on an ensemble of sparse representations through an ensemble of discriminative dictionaries satisfying SRC assumption. The ensemble learning has the advantage to reduce the sensitivity due to the limited size of the training data and is performed based on random subspace sampling over 2D-PCA space while keeping the image inherent structure and information. In order to obtain discriminative dictionaries satisfying SRC assumption, a new space is learned by minimizing and maximizing the intra-class and inter-class variations using 2D-LDA. Extensive experiments are conducted on two publicly available palmprint data sets: multispectral and PolyU. Obtained results showed very promising results compared with both state-of-the-art holistic and coding methods. Besides these ndings, we provide an empirical analysis of the parameters involved in the proposed technique to guide the neophyte. INDEX TERMS Biometrics, palmprint, sparse representation, ensemble learning. I. INTRODUCTION Over the past few decades, biometrics have become an impor- tant tool to enhance security. Nowadays, they are widely used by government agencies and private industries. A large variety of biometric modalities including face, iris, gait, and palmprint have been studied providing different rates of accu- racy and robustness [1]. In this work, we consider to enhance palmprint based biometric identi cation due to its high relia- bility, stability, and user acceptability. A palmprint is de ned as the inner surface of a hand containing a large variety of discriminative features [2]. Various palmprint recognition methods have been proposed, they can be broadly organized in two main categories [3]: holistic and structural. The rst one attempts to de ne the whole palmprint image as a single data set while the second one is based on local information such as lines and texture. The holistic approaches use full image for recognition. Due to its high dimensionality, many researchers have focused on dimensionality reduction using PCA [4], LDA [5] and ICA [6]. The matrix-based dimensionality reduction methods which have the advantage to preserve the spatial structure have also been used including 2D-PCA [7], 2D-LDA [8] and 2D Locality Preserving Projection (2D-LPP) [9]. The holistic approaches mainly operate at the pixel level leading some- times to poor performances in the presence of degradation caused by noise, blur, distortion and illumination.

Example of Pre-Processing Transforms for Palmprint Recognition this problem, several of the shelf transforms summarized in Table 1 have been applied as pre-processing step. FIGURE 1. Example of the extracted features from palmprint region of interest in the local approaches. (a) Line-based [17]. (b) Coding-based [32]. (c) Texture-based [29]. The structural or local approaches are based on the extrac- tion of the lines and texture features from the palmprint images (Figure 1). They can be organized as: i) line, ii) coding and iii) texture based. Line-based approaches: Palm lines represent the basic features for recog- nition which can be broadly categorized into three principal lines: heartline, headline and lifeline. Several works have tried to apply various edge detection techniques to extract the palm lines for recognition [16] [18]. Unfortunately, the perfor- mance of these algorithms strongly depends upon the accuracy of the underlying line detectors. Coding-based approaches: They encode the responses of a bank of l- ters into bitwise codes and then different met- rics such as Hamming distance are applied for matching. A large variety of coding methods using various number of Gabor lter orientations have been introduced including Palm Code [19], Com- petitive Code [20], Ordinal Code [21], Fusion Code [22], Binary Orientation Co-occurrence Vec- tor (BOCV) [23], E-BOCV [24], Robust Line Ori- entation Code (RLOC) [25] and Half Orientation Code (HOC) [26]. The characteristics of each code are summarized in Table 2. Texture-based approaches: They seek to extract the palm features using various texture extractors including Local Binary Pattern (LBP) [27], [28], Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG) [29] and their variants [30], [31]. TABLE 2. Non Exhaustive Coding-Based Methods II. MOTIVATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS From the aforementioned introduction, it can be noticed that not much contributions have been introduced in the holistic approach except some works which tried to apply various conventional subspace learning techniques. On the other hand, it can be seen that the structural approaches and especially coding ones have got a particular interest. Indeed, these methods currently represent the most in uential and suitable for one-to-one veri cation applications. However, it should be also noted that their accuracy strongly depends on the human knowledge for hyper-parameters tuning such as Gabor parameters and the number of directions. Beside of coding methods advantages, they have also some limitations for identi cation (i.e. one-to-all) due to the need to match each test sample to all the training samples (one by one) [33]. Consequently, inspired by the recent development of sparse coding in the eld of machine learning some works based on sparse representations have been introduced for ef cient palmprint identi cation [33] [35]. SRC [36] has shown its ability to achieve impressive accu- racy in several problems including face and object recog- nition. It considers a query image as a linear combination of all training samples by assuming that the samples of a speci c subject lie in a particular linear subspace which is different from the subspaces spanned by the other subjects. Therefore, the query image is expected to be mainly repre- sented by the training samples of a single subject. This may be more ef ciently implemented by enforcing sparsity on the linear representation over all training data. In other words, SRC can be seen as a sparse collaborative representation method. Sparse means that only few training samples are necessary for the representation of the test sample and hence the signi cant representation coef cients can be used for the classi cation. SRC represents a good alternative for the conventional classi ers including Linear Regression Classi- cation (LRC) [37] which can be considered as a simple nearest subspace [38]. It directly applies training images as dictionary for the sparse representation. Therefore its per- formance strongly depends on the quality of the training data. Although SRC has good discriminative ability when the number of training samples of every class is large enough to represent its variations, it may not be proper for classi cation when the variations of some classes are not well represented by their training samples. Unfortunately, palmprint images do not only contain iden- tity information but also much other information such as 3242 VOLUME 6, 2018 I. Rida et al.: Palmprint Identification Using an Ensemble of Sparse Representations illumination and distortion due to movement of hand and unconstrained conditions leading to a signi cant increase of intraclass variability [39]. In this case, the sparse representa- tion assumption may not hold well in the original space due to the large intra-class variations causing a misclassi cation of a new test sample [38], [40]. Though a growing effort has been devoted in order to develop biometric identi cation systems that can operate in unconstrained conditions, many problems still remain to be solved, including the design of techniques to handle varying illumination sources and low quality images resulting from such acquisition conditions. The development of techniques effective in such challenging situations requires vigorous research efforts. A possible solution to alleviate the problem of large intra- class variations for SRC is to nd a more effective space where the assumption of separability between subspaces spanned by distinct classes holds better [41]. For this sake, we attempt to learn a discriminative space where samples from different classes are well represented by maximizing the inter-class differences and minimizing the intra-class variability. In other words, our problem is amenable to nd a projection matrix based on 2D-LDA [42] which can be seen advantageous compared conventional LDA due to its numerical stability. The sparse representations based on the projected training data in the new space serving as new dictionary are more suitable for classi cation since this latter one satis es better the assumption of separability compared to original one. Despite the impressive results of SRC, its performance also strongly depends on the size of training data. Indeed, limited training samples in some applications including palmprint and face could lead to lower accuracy [38]. To address this problem, we propose to construct an ensemble of sparse representations based on ensemble learning which has the advantage to reduce the sensitivity due to the limited size of training data [43]. Indeed, instead of building a single global sparse representation, we build an ensemble of sparse representations based on an ensemble of discriminative dic- tionaries through a random sampling method. Existing meth- ods attempt to construct the ensemble by randomly sampling features from the whole image [44], [45] which may destroy inherent local spatial relationship among pixels within the image. In the present work, we propose to use 2D-PCA [46] which has the advantage to keep the image structure in order to build an initial space and then randomly sample subspaces from it to create the ensemble. Furthermore, the dimensional- ity of the feature space is usually much larger than the number of the training samples per class, this is known as the Under Sample Problem (USP). 2D-LDA often fails when faced the USP and one solution is to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space using 2D-PCA [47]. The nal classi cation decision is obtained by aggregating all sparse representations. To summarize, palmprint identi cation based SRC suffers from large intra-class variations and low size of training sam- ples per class. To address this problem, we propose a simple yet ef cient method by computing an ensemble of sparse representations through an ensemble of discriminative dictio- naries. Unlike in the case of existing methods, the dictionaries are generated by random sampling procedure over 2D-PCA which has the advantage to keep inherent images informa- tion. To satisfy SRC assumption and ensure the discrimina- tion of dictionaries, projected training data in each subspace from different classes are further separated by minimizing and maximizing the intra and inter class variation through 2D-LDA. To the best of our knowledge no such method has previously been proposed for palmprint identi cation. The effectiveness and the ef ciency of the proposed method have been corroborated by extensive experiments conducted on two publicly palmparint dataset: multispec- tral [48] and PolyU [19]. Experimental results showed very promising results when compared to both holistic [4], [5], [7], [8], [36], [37] and structural methods [19] [26]. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section III introduces the theoretical description of the pro- posed method. Section IV reports the experimental results and discussions. Finally, Section V concludes the paper. III. PROPOSED APPROACH A. INTRODUCTION Let us consider {(xi, yi)}n i=1 where xi RM is an image of M pixels arranged in column vector and yi {1, , C} its label. We consider a class based dictionary Dc RM nc the nc training samples associated to each class c. The global dictionary D = [D1 DC] RM n represents the con- catenation of the class based dictionaries {Dc}C c=1. The sparse representation of a test sample x over the global dictionary D noted aT = [aT 1 aT c aT C] is given by: min a 1 2 x Da 2 2 + a 1 (1) where . 1 denotes the 1-norm corresponding to the absolute sum of the vector a, is a parameter controlling the com- promise between the reconstruction error and sample-wise sparsity and a represents the sparse representation over the global dictionary D. The problem (1) can be ef ciently solved using many algorithms [49], [50]. With the assumption that subspaces of distinct classes are independent to each other, the formulation (1) achieves a discriminative representation where signi cant nonzero coef- cients are only associated to the correct subject [51], [52]. Thus the resulting sparse representation in (1) named in the literature Sparse Representation for Classi cation (SRC) [36] is suitable for classi cation. The latter is performed by com- puting residual reconstruction error of the test sample x using the training samples of each class c serving as a dictionary Dc and their corresponding sparse coef cients ac as follows: ec = x Dcac 2 2 c = 1, , C (2) The class label of the given test sample is assigned to class c minimizing the reconstruction error using Dc and ac. Despite of the impressive results of SRC, a number of works put in doubt its effectiveness for VOLUME 6, 2018 3243 I. Rida et al.: Palmprint Identification Using an Ensemble of Sparse Representations classi cation [53], [54]. Indeed, SRC suffers from two major problems: lack of training samples per class and large intra- class variations. Starting by the rst one, it has been shown that SRC performs better in large scale problems where training set contains a large and suf cient number of samples per class. The limited training data in real applications is mainly due to the cost of data collection or computation cost. To alleviate this problem, we propose a simple but ef cient ensemble learning method in order to build an ensemble of L dictionaries {D }L =1 through random subspace sampling on 2D-PCA space which has the advantage to be computation- ally ef cient while keeping fundamental image information. The second problem is caused by the large intra-class vari- ations of the training samples of different classes (class based dictionaries) {Dc}C c=1. In this case, SRC is known to have some stability problems [53]. Typically, given a test sample highly correlated to two training samples originating from two distinct classes, SRC will randomly select one of the two which may lead to unreliable result. To alleviate this problem, existing state-of-the-art methods tried to include training data labels during sparse optimization [55] [57]. One possible alternative to include class labels is to project the training data in new space where class based dictionaries {Dc}C c=1 are well separated [41]. To this end, an easy and effective solution is to nd a new space where intra-class and inter-class variations are minimized and maximized respectively through 2D-LDA. B. ENSEMBLE LEARNING BASED RANDOM SUBSPACE SAMPLING Randomly sampling features from the whole palmprint image may destroy inherent local spatial relationship among pixels within the image. To tackle this problem, we propose to sample subspaces from the 2D-PCA space. Given a set of palmprint images  Xi Rn1 n2 n i=1, 2D-PCA [46] is used as the rst step to reduce the dimen- sionality of the data. Unlike in conventional one-dimensional PCA, 2D-PCA preserves the matrix structure of Xi. Formally, 2D-PCA aims at nding a transformation matrix R Rn2 d which projects each image Xi in to a matrix Zi = Xi R Rn1 d of reduced dimension (d n2). It solves the following optimization problem: max R Rn2 d Trace  R SR  s.t. R R = I (3) where S = 1/n Pn i=1  Xi X   Xi X  is the covariance matrix and X is the mean of training images. The solution R of (3) corresponds to the d-dominant eigenvectors of S. Any image can be projected in the subspace spanned by the columns of R as: Zi = XiR Rn1 d i = 1, , n (4) To construct our ensemble we consider L subspaces, each spanned by N d randomly selected eigenvectors from R . Hence, starting from the solution of 2D-PCA, we generate L projection matrices  R Rn1 N L =1 where R is a set of N randomly sampled columns from R . For each matrix R , we proceed as follows: the whole training data is projected in to the subspace spanned by the corresponding eigenvectors giving  Z i = XiR n i=1. C. EMBEDDING CLASS LABELS INTO DICTIONARY In order to obtain discriminative dictionaries satisfying SRC assumption per each subspace , we propose to include class labels in to the dictionaries. This can be done by boost- ing more the class-separability [41] of the training data in each subspace . Indeed we seek to determine a projection matrix W Rn1 m, for xed m n1 in order to maxi- mize class separability. Formally, this can be ef ciently done through 2D-LDA which seeks to maximize and minimize the between-class and within-class variances leading to the optimization problem [42]: max W Rn1 m Trace  W S wW  1  W S bW  (5) where S b and S w are the between-class and within-class scatter matrices given as by: Sb = C X c=1 nc   Zc Z    Zc Z  (6) Sw = C X c=1 n X i=1 I1yi=c  Zi Zc  (7) nc is the cardinality of the cth class, Zc stands for the center of class c, while Z is the global mean. The solution W of problem (5) corresponds to the m leading eigenvectors of (S w) 1(S b). In order to obtain more dictionaries robust to the intra-class variation problem,  Z i n i=1 are projected in each subspace through W as follows: B i = W Z i i = 1, , n. (8) D. SPARSE REPRESENTATIONS AGGREGATION Projected training samples in each subspace , {B i }n i=1 Rm N are arranged as column vectors and stacked in a matrix in order to obtain an ensemble of dictionaries {D Rs n}L =1 where s = m N. These resulting dictionaries {D }L =1 hold better SRC assumptions and reduce the computational burden since s < M. In order to integrate results over multiple subspaces we have used two strategies. In the rst one, we assign a label to a testing sample X by minimizing reconstruction error over all subspaces: ec = L X =1 x D ca c 2 2 c = 1, , C (9) where x is the vectorized projection of X in the subspace . In the second strategy, each vectorized test sample x is separately classi ed in each subspace and the nal decision 3244 VOLUME 6, 2018 I. Rida et al.: Palmprint Identification Using an Ensemble of Sparse Representations is taken based on majority voting [58] among all individual decisions. In fact this scheme has helped to generate better accuracy due to a non-linear decision in each subspace. IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS We performed a series of experiments to evaluate the pro- posed approach on two publicly available palmprint datasets: multi spectral [48] and PolyU [19]. The obtained results are compared with seven state-of-art holistic methods including PCA [4], 2D-PCA [7], LDA [5], 2D-LDA [8], 2D-LPP [9], SRC [36] and LRC [37]. In addition to eight structural coding-based techniques including Palm Code [19], Com- petitive Code [20], Ordinal Code [21], Fusion Code [22], Binary Orientation Co-occurrence Vector (BOCV) [23], E-BOCV [24], Robust Line Orientation Code (RLOC) [25] and Half Orientation Code (HOC) [26]. For fair comparisons, we have followed the protocols and data splits proposed by Fei et al. [26]. A. PALMPRINT DATABASES The multispectral palmprint dataset1 contains four inde- pendent datasets including Red, Green, Blue and Near Infrared (NIR) spectrums. 12 images per each hand and illu- mination from 250 subjects were captured. In the following we refer to this dataset by multispectral. In the left and right palmprint dataset2, 187 subjects were asked to provide 10 palmprint images per each hand. In the following this dataset is referred to as the PolyU. The content of datasets is summarized in Table 3. Note that the two palms of the same subject are considered as two distinct classes. TABLE 3. Content of Palmprint Recognition Datasets B. EXPERIMENTAL SETTING In our experiments we have used the provided palmprint region of interest of xed size 32 32 (Figure 2) extracted by the algorithm described in [19]. Since we are interested to the identi cation, the accuracy is measured by the Cor- rect Classi cation Rate (CCR) corresponding to the ratio of correct classi ed images to overall images. For sake of com- parison, we have used the same number of training samples in the literature following the proposed protocols and data splits. We perform our experiments with 2 and 4 training samples and the remaining ones as test. Each experiment is repeated 10 times to average out the effect of random subspace sampling and we report the mean accuracy and standard deviation. In the proposed method there are four parameters to tune including N, m, L and . The rst three represent the dimen- sionality of subspaces, number of projection directions of the 1www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/ biometrics/MultispectralPalmprint/MSP.htm 2www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/ biometrics/index.htm FIGURE 2.

The parameters N, m and are opti- mized using a two-folds cross-validation scheme where 50% of training data is used as validation. The value of N and m are selected from the set {2, 4, , 30} and is taken from {0.1, 0.2, , 1}. For the selection of L we consider that the number of distinct subspaces of size N = 30 out of n1 = 32 are 496. The same number we get for subspaces of size N = 2. To remain consistent across subspaces of varying dimensionality and ensure good generalization abil- ity, we select L = 500 in all experiments. C. RESULTS Tables 4 and 5 compare the accuracy of our algorithm to other state-of-the-art techniques using 2 and 4 training samples respectively. The best two results are highlighted by bold and underline. In Table 4 our algorithm has outperformed all holistic and structural coding-based techniques included in this study. In Table 5, the proposed algorithm obtained better accuracy than all techniques except for the NIR band where Half Orientation Code (HOC) performed better. While, coding methods depend on human knowledge for hyper-parameters such as Gabor parameters and the num- ber of directions, the proposed algorithm is automated and does not need human expertise to compute discriminative sparse representations for classi cation. It should be also noticed that in all experiments we obtained better accuracy than conventional SRC method based on single dictionary corresponding to the training data in the original space. D. IMPACT OF HYPER-PARAMETERS We study the impact of the number of subspaces L on the overall performance accuracy (Figure 3). It can be seen that the accuracy is increasing from L = 100 to L = 300 due to the involvement of more new discriminative dictionaries. In addition to that, their combination leads to better general- ization. However, beyond L = 300 the performance becomes VOLUME 6, 2018 3245 I.

(b) Red. saturated since the dictionaries have already captured maxi- mum discriminative information. Therefore adding more sub- spaces just makes the results more stable. The variation of performance with the dimensionality of the subspaces is shown in Figures 4 & 5. As N or m is increased the performance improves. In fact smaller dimen- sional subspaces are not able to satisfy the SRC assumption resulting in poor performances. It should be also noticed that once the dimensionality reaches a peak value then there is no further improvement. In some cases performance may actually degrades which is due to the inclusion of less dis- criminative dimensions. Indeed, the number of projections m should be large enough to extract important and well FIGURE 5.

E. COMPUTATIONAL COST ANALYSIS Experiments were performed in Matlab on Dell Precision Tower 5810. The execution time increases linearly with the increasing dimensionality for either N and m as shown in Figure 6. For N = 10, for L = 500 and m = 10 our algorithm takes approximately 0.60 seconds to process one palmprint image. Table 6 compares the execution time of our method to other state-of-the-art terhniqques. It can be seen that the speed of our algorithm is good compared to other techniques, the speed can further be increased by parallel processing. 3246 VOLUME 6, 2018 I.

CONCLUSION In this a paper we considered to tackle the problems of the large intra-class variations and the lack of training samples related to palmprint identi cation through Sparse Represen- tation for Classi cation (SRC). This is done by building an ensemble of sparse representations across an ensemble of discriminative dictionaries satisfying SRC assumption. The ensemble learning is performed by a random sampling procedure over 2D-PCA space which has the advantage to keep inherent image information. In order to enforce the SRC assumption, intra-class and inter-class variations of projected training samples from different classes in each subspace serv- ing as dictionary are minimized and maximized respectively. The nal decision is taken based on majority voting among all individual decisions. Experimental results on multispec- tral and PolyU datasets have shown very promising results compared to the state-of-the-art methods. REFERENCES [1] I. Rida, X. Jiang, and G. L.
