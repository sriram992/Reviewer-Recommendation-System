IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS 1 Optimal, Secure Cluster Head Placement Through Source Coding Techniques in Wireless Sensor Networks Tata Jagannadha Swamy , Garimella Ramamurthy, and Padmalaya Nayak Abstract In many applications of wireless sensor networks 1 (such as military communications), secure communication, mes- 2 sage delay minimization and energy ef ciency are crucial. Such 3 requirements constrain special or Important Cluster Head (ICH) 4 placement over the network architecture modeled by a tree. The 5 optimal important cluster head placement problem is formulated 6 and solved using source coding results (providing minimum 7 possible delay and security through pre x-free paths over the 8 tree). Also, through simulations energy ef ciency of the proposed 9 approach is established. The reported research is naturally 10 applicable for many applications of Wireless Sensor Networks 11 (WSNs) such as Body Area Networks (BANs). 12 Index Terms Wireless sensor networks, cluster head, impor- 13 tant cluster head, pre x-free path, source coding, Kraft s 14 inequality. 15 I. INTRODUCTION 16 T HE rapid growth of wireless communication technology 17 has led to the development of low power, low cost 18 and tiny sensor nodes. Each tiny node has the capacity to 19 sense, process, and to transmit the sensed data to base station. 20 Randomly deployed tiny nodes form a network for data 21 transmission. These Networks have become extremely popular 22 due to the large number of applications in the areas of intrusion 23 detection, habitat, environmental monitoring, etc. However, 24 some of the limitations of sensor nodes are mainly in storage 25 capacity, power capacity, and short communication range [1]. 26 These limitations can be overcome by some ef cient sensor 27 node placement schemes and hierarchical implementations [2]. 28 Secure data transmission and low energy consumption is 29 possible through choices of Cluster Heads (CHs) in the 30 wireless sensor eld [3]. The entire sensor eld is divided 31 into several small elds known as clusters and each one is 32 headed by a cluster head [16]. Among cluster heads, some 33 are important and others are ordinary CHs. These important 34 cluster heads transfer data between a base station and other 35 cluster heads. 36 In Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), the cluster head 37 placement problems have not been adequately studied in the 38 literature, while secure placement of nodes in sensor eld has 39 Manuscript received September 26, 2019; revised October 17, 2019; accepted November 2, 2019.

Motivation : Wireless 40 Sensor Networks nd many applications in elds such as 41 Military Communication, healthcare etc. 42 Security Constraint: Speci cally, in the case of commu- 43 nications among military personal, certain messages can 44 be received by of cers of certain cadre and above (in the 45 military hierarchy) only. 46 Optimization Constraint: Also, it is clear that messages 47 will have delay constraint and must be received by 48 of cers in real time. 49 In this letter, we propose a novel optimal approach for the 50 sensor placement in WSNs. The main goal is to minimize 51 average depth of Important Cluster Heads from the base station 52 by reducing the number of hops. Further, we ensure message 53 security and make, the paths from Base Station (BS) to Impor- 54 tant Cluster Heads to be pre x-free. The contributions are, 55 (i) Minimize the average depth of an ICH from the BS in terms 56 of hop-count, (ii) Provide an optimal hierarchy in the network 57 for secure data transmission. (iii). Relate CH placement and 58 source coding technique. The rest of the letter is organized 59 as follows: In Section II, the problem speci cation with the 60 help of Secure Cluster Head placement in the network eld 61 is discussed. In Section III, the relationship between secure 62 cluster head placement and optimal source coding techniques 63 in WSNs are discussed and later followed by conclusion in 64 section IV. 65 II. SYSTEM MODEL 66 The entire system structure is based on the approaches made 67 for an optimal, energy ef cient and secure wireless sensor 68 network. To minimize the average depth of an ICH from the 69 BS in terms of hop-count, to provide an optimal hierarchy in 70 the network for secure data transmission, and to relate CH 71 placement and source coding technique are the three main 72 proposals required for an ef cient network design. 73 Based upon hierarchy among military personnel, impor- 74 tance values are assigned/decided 75 The total number of important cluster heads is decided 76 by a number of of cers in the military hierarchy 77 We realized that the above motivation can be understood by 78 modeling the real-time communication problem as a source 79 coding problem. Speci cally the important cluster heads are 80 chosen as the pre x free nodes (code words) on the military 81 hierarchy so that the security constraint is met. 82 In this context, a tree based structure is selected and 83 the depth of a tree is the path with maximum number of 84 hops between BS and leaf nodes and the depth of BS in 85 a tree structure is zero.

Wireless sensor network D-ary tree architecture. full tree can be calculated by Dd, Where d is the depth of 87 the tree and D represents the type of tree structure (e.g. 88 D = 2 implies binary tree). Total number of nodes in a 89 binary tree structure is N = 2d+1 1 and the total number 90 of leaves is equal to nodes at the last level of the tree. For 91 any D-ary tree, the total number of nodes in the structure is 92 given by N = Dd+1 1 D 1 . Fig. 1 is an example of hierarchical 93 sensor network architecture representing CHs, ICHs and BS. 94 Throughout the letter, wherever required, we consider fully 95 binary trees. The results also apply for fully D-ary trees. 96 A. Importance Values of Cluster Heads: In a sensor eld, 97 selection of important cluster head is essential. In order to 98 signify this distinction, a value of importance is assigned to 99 some cluster heads in the organization based on its internal 100 energy and its closeness to the base station. According to 101 the importance value, ICHs are labeled as more important 102 than ordinary cluster heads in the hierarchical structure. For 103 instance, a node with a hop count of zero has no superiors 104 and only has subordinates. It implies that these nodes can 105 act as the base station in the sensor eld. It is important 106 to note that cluster heads with a higher importance value in 107 a sensor eld should have a lower hop count. These nodes 108 are more vital members in the sensor eld and should be 109 closer to the base station. It can be easily observed that 110 hop count and importance values are inversely related. The 111 normalized equation for the importance probabilities is shown 112 in equation (1). 113 pi = vi c i=1 vi (1) 114 where pi is the probability of importance and vi is the 115 importance value of ith important cluster head and c is the 116 total number of ICHs. Now consider a binary tree representing 117 sensor eld consisting of cluster heads. Pre x (or pre x- 118 free or instantaneous) code is a code in which no codeword 119 is a pre x of any other codeword. Pre x codes are uniquely 120 and instantly decodable [9]. PROBLEM: Place the important 121 cluster heads in a binary tree such that the average path length 122 (in terms of hop count) is as small as possible and the paths 123 from root node to ICHs are pre x-free. 124 In Fig. 2, node labeled as ICH-A has depth of two, whereas 125 the node labeled as ICH-B has depth of four from the Base 126 Station. A large importance probability directly implies a small 127 depth of member node or a smaller hop count, which suggests 128 that the member is more important to the base station. It is 129 Fig. 2. Example of a binary tree structure with WSNs. only logical for important cluster heads be near the base station 130 of the sensor eld. So, the idea is to de ne the average depth 131 of all ICHs in the hierarchy of the sensor eld to be the sum of 132 the product of their respective depths and importance values, 133 as shown in equation (2). 134 n = k  i=1 pini (2) 135 where pi is the importance probability of ith cluster head. ni 136 is the number of hops of ith cluster head from the base station 137 and n is the average path length. An immediate inference to 138 this is: If pi is large, ni can be made small and vice versa. 139 B: Pre x-free path and Tree structure: A path is de ned 140 to be a sequence of edges from a start vertex or member to 141 an end vertex or member and each node is associated with 142 ICH or codeword in the sensor eld hierarchy. A D-ary tree 143 hierarchy will produce a D-ary codeword. Here it was selected 144 as a binary tree with D = 2. Starting at the Base Station, 145 we append a 1 to the edge leading to the right sub-tree or a 146 0 for the edge leading to the left sub-tree. Once the end 147 member node is reached, the sequence of steps with 1 s and 0 s 148 will represent the code word for that member. The pre x-free 149 condition is signi cant because no two ICHs have a codeword 150 with the same pre x-free path. If the base station wants to 151 communicate with an important cluster head, then it must 152 choose the speci c pre x-free path only. 153 C: Inherent Security Provided by Pre x-free path: Organi- 154 zation (hospital, military etc ) determines which nodes get 155 Higher Important Values (HIV) and which nodes get lower 156 (LIV). Goals: i) Transfer of delay sensitive sensed data from 157 sensors (cluster heads) to the base station i.e. Optimization 158 of average hop count from important cluster heads for Base 159 Station. ii) The communication must be secure in the sense that 160 information from ICH s of higher importance value should not 161 reach those ICH s of lower importance values i.e. when the 162 base station wants to send cryptographic keys, the key meant 163 for CH with Lower Importance Value (LIV) can be heard by a 164 CH of Higher Importance Value (HIV). But the key meant for 165 any CH with higher importance value (HIV) cannot be heard 166 by CHs of lower importance value. Thus the security of WSN 167 is automatically enhanced. 168 III. SECURE CLUSTER HEAD PLACEMENT 169 Let X be a random variable and X1, X2 . . . Xk Be statis- 170 tically independent and identically distributed (IID) variables, 171 SWAMY et al.: OPTIMAL, SECURE CH PLACEMENT THROUGH SOURCE CODING TECHNIQUES IN WSNs 3 having a common probability mass function (generated from 172 a common source). n1, n2, . . . , nk are the hop counts with 173 probabilities p1, p2, .., pk. We are interested in the mean length 174 of path in terms of number of hops from a leaf nodes i.e. the 175 number of hops required for packets to reach the base sta- 176 tion [13]. For security and energy concerns, minimum number 177 of hops is preferable for packet data transmission [6], [12]. 178 A. Source Coding Problem: In [14], it is considered that 179 any pre x-free code with the codeword length/hop-distances 180 must satisfy the inequality shown in equation (3) [4]. 181 k  i=1 D ni 1 (3) 182 Consider a pre x-free binary tree in which each node has 183 two children and certain nodes of the tree represent the code 184 words. The pre x condition on the code words implies that 185 no codeword is an ancestor of any other codeword on the 186 tree. A full binary tree of depth nmax has 2nmax leaves. 187 The channel codeword to a source symbol has the codeword 188 length ni. A pre x-free code can be constructed by using 189 Kraft s inequality. We now discuss the lower bound on the 190 average codeword length i.e. n = k i=1 pini yielding optimal 191 codeword lengths 192 ni = logDpi (4) 193 These non-integer codeword lengths yield average or expected 194 codeword lengths as per equation (5) 195 n = k  i=1 pini = k  i=1 pilogDpi = HD(X) (5) 196 The expected average codeword length n of any instantaneous 197 D-ary code for a random variable X is greater than or equal 198 to the entropy D-ary HD(X), that is, 199 n HD(X) = H(X) logD (6) 200 and with equality if and only if D ni = pi. 201 By choosing the codeword lengths (i.e. hop count from 202 root node) suitably, kraft s inequality is satis ed. Hop count 203 essentially determines the average delay through the asso- 204 ciate normalized importance values (i.e. probabilities i.e. pi 205 Source coding provides achievable average delay for commu- 206 nication (using well known lower bound). Thus, the modeling 207 problem boils down to the source coding problem. Specif- 208 ically the optimization problem follows objective function 209 J(n1, n2, . . . . . . nn) = n i=1 pini (where n is are hopcounts 210 and p is are normalized importance values). 211 Constraint: M i=1 D ni where D corresponds to balanced 212 D-ary tree. In the presentation, correspondence to source 213 coding is made clear even at the cost of redundant explana- 214 tion (e.g. Explanation of security constraint and optimization 215 problem). 216 B. Secure Cluster Head Placement with Huffman Coding: 217 It has been discussed in section II that an optimally secure 218 hierarchy is one in which the average hop count from the 219 base station to ICHs is minimized. The smaller the distance, 220 the more optimal it is. In a well-organized sensor eld, the base 221 station would prefer the more important ICHs to be closer than 222 Fig. 3. Example of Huffman coding. Fig. 4. Example of non-pre x code. ICHs of lower importance. The problem of optimally placing 223 ICHs is quite crucial in wireless sensor networks. To provide 224 importance probabilities for all ICHs and to place them at 225 different depths in the sensor eld hierarchy, Huffman coding 226 can be used. Considering the importance probabilities of ICHs, 227 we can organize an optimal placement pattern in a sensor 228 eld which would also be unique. Huffman coding algorithm 229 produces a hierarchical structure [13], [14] similar to the one 230 shown below in Fig. 3. The average distance from the base 231 station node to each of the cluster head nodes is minimized 232 and a pre x-free path exists to all ICHs. Fig. 3 shows, no two 233 important cluster head nodes share their entire path with 234 another cluster head node. 235 Once the ICH is chosen at a certain depth, no other ICH can 236 be chosen either in its sub-tree or from its subordinate cluster 237 heads. In g. 3, as already ICH was placed at codeword of 238 1 0 , there cannot be another ICH at codeword of 1 0 0 , 239 because this violates the condition, i.e. No code word should 240 be a pre x of another, and hence it becomes impossible to be 241 uniquely decoded. It is important to note that after placing 242 ICHs using Huffman coding, we can achieve an optimally 243 secure hierarchy i.e. A pre x-free path to all important cluster 244 heads, an optimal distance from the base station to ICHs 245 according to importance probabilities (a uniquely decodable 246 code scheme). Example of non-pre x code as shown in Fig.4. 247 C. Energy Ef ciency and Security with Source Coding: 248 In the routing protocol the data is propagated from nodes with 249 higher hop count from the BS to the nodes with lower hop 250 count (using a tree data structure). If a node at higher hop 251 count receives a packet from lower hop count node [5], [10], 252 it simply drops it, thus ooding is prevented, saves energy. 253 By using pre x- free path, security of sensitive data (trans- 254 mitted) is handled ef ciently. This scheme assumes that 255 there is hierarchical structure among the nodes. Only nodes 256 with higher importance value have access to important data. 257 4 IEEE COMMUNICATIONS LETTERS Fig. 5. Nodes vs node lifetime with different protocols. Fig. 6. Nodes-vs-residual energy with different protocols. Lower importance nodes are prevented from accessing such 258 information. In popular schemes like LEACH (Low Energy 259 Adaptive Clustering Hierarchy) and HEED (Hybrid Energy 260 Ef cient Distributed) [11], [15], the data are ooded along 261 all directions using Cluster Heads. It was shown that the 262 above proposed protocol, termed by us as EELP (Energy 263 Ef cient Leveling Protocol), ooding of data is prevented 264 from spreading over the entire tree structure. Thus the EELP 265 saves energy, thereby increasing the network lifetime. In the 266 following overall sensor network life time using EELP is 267 compared to the popular protocols. 268 The simulation results of the proposed protocol are com- 269 pared with the popular protocols in Fig. 5, and Fig. 6. In Fig. 5, 270 the node lifetime with respect to the number of nodes are 271 shown. If the node number is less, node or network lifetime 272 is high with all three protocols, but it gradually decreases 273 when the node number is increasing. EELP is showing better 274 performance than other two protocols along with decrease in 275 the network lifetime. Fig. 6 shows that the nodes residual 276 energy with respect to active nodes in the network. Here, if the 277 node number is less, EELP has the highest residual energy and 278 will be decreasing gradually, when the number is increasing. 279 Here EELP is showing better results than LEACH and HEED. 280 Of all the analysis and simulations, EELP is more ef cient 281 than LEACH and HEED in terms of network lifetime, node 282 residual energy. From the results and comparisons EELP is 283 more energy ef cient protocol. 284 IV. CONCLUSION 285 In this letter, we proposed a new protocol for optimal cluster 286 head selection and node placement in WSNs. For Energy 287 Ef ciency, secure routing and network lifetime improvement, 288 Important Cluster Heads (ICHs) are selected by providing 289 some importance value to Cluster Heads and hierarchy among 290 the CHs are maintained with the help of pre x-free path. 291 A relationship is derived between secure cluster head place- 292 ment and source coding and it is derived based on Kraft s 293 inequality and Huffman coding. Results show that, the pro- 294 posed EELP increases the network life time, providing data 295 security and Energy Ef ciency compared to LEACH and 296 HEED protocols. 297 REFERENCES 298 [1] I. F.
