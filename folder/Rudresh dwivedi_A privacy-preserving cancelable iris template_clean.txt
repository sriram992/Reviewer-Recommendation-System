However, security theft and privacy invasion are two passive issues that still persist in the effective deployment of biometric-based authentication systems. Com- promise of biometric data can potentially lead to serious security violation as the user s biometric trait cannot be changed. In order to prevent the invasion of biometric templates, it is desired to morph the original biometric template through non-invertible or irrevers- ible transformation function.This transformed template is referred to as cancelable template and can be replaced or reissued in case of compromise. In this paper, we propose a novel cancelable iris template generation technique based on randomized look-up table mapping. The technique utilizes a decimal vector generated from a rotation-invariant feature vector. The feature vector is generated using 1-D Log Gabor lter applied to the iris image. Experi- ments carried out on various iris databases con rm the ef cacy of the proposed approach. After applying the template protection mechanism, we have achieved Equal Error Rate (EER) of 0.37%, 0.43% and 0.79% for CASIA-V 1.0, CASIA-V3-Interval and ICE 2005 iris databases, respectively. Moreover, the transformation preserves the irreversibility, revocability and di- versity properties of the concealable iris templates. 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Introduction Over the last decade, biometric authentication has gained much public attention as compared to traditional knowledge (pass- word, key) or token-based authentication systems and is widely deployed to identify/verify users rmly in several domains. However, biometric-based authentication systems suffer from security and privacy invasion challenges as their compro- mise may expose sensitive and ancillary information about a user. Further, if the biometric template gets compromised, it results in permanent identity theft as biometric data are in- trinsically linked to the user. This introduces the research question how do we replace the biometric data which is per- manent and limited for a user without affecting the accuracy of the system? .The different attacks such as hill-climbing, cor- relation or stolen-token attacks (Jain et al., 2008) can be launched for illicit use of biometric data which reduce the reliability of the system. In correlation attack, the attacker intercepts mul- tiple protected templates of the same user from different applications and tries to nd out the correlation between these protected templates to retrieve the original template (Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011). The hill-climbing attack is launched to maxi- mize the matching score by iteratively and incrementally modifying the biometric input (Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011). In case of the stolen token attack, the imposter captures the genuine * Corresponding author. E-mail addresses: phd1301201006@iiti.ac.in (R. Dwivedi), somnathd@iiti.ac.in (S.

To address these issues, there is a demand of designing a robust biometric system with substantial template protec- tion mechanism which will be able to generate a new transformed template in case of compromise or generate dis- tinct templates for the different applications to prevent cross- matching. Moreover, the biometric system should meet four design criteria to allow utmost template protection: irrevers- ibility, revocability, diversity and accuracy (Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011). Irreversibility implies that it should be infeasible or computationally hard to reconstruct the original template from the transformed template (Ouda et al., 2010). Revocability means that if the transformed biometric template has been stolen or compromised, the veri cation system should be able to gen- erate another unique template, or generate different unique templates from the original template and replaced in case of compromise (Khan et al., 2015) to prevent cross-matching in the different applications. Diversity ensures the generation of distinct protected templates from the same unprotected tem- plate so that the different templates can be used in various applications for the same identity to ensure the privacy (Ouda et al., 2010; Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011). Finally, the degradation in the recognition performance should be preserved over the ac- curacy obtained in the original biometric system (Ouda et al., 2010). Several approaches have been proposed to obtain a secure biometric template. These approaches try to encounter the above mentioned privacy and security issues taking into account the practical biometric design criteria. Cancelable biomet- rics (Ratha et al., 2001) is one of them, which employs a key- dependent transformation to the raw biometric data. The transformation is irreversible such that the original biomet- ric template cannot be revealed from the stored transformed template (Hammerle-Uhl et al., 2009). Biohashing based can- celable approaches proposed in Jin et al. (2014), Nanni et al. (2011), and Teoh et al. (2008) derive a uniformly distributed random sequence using a hash key.These approaches perform well if tokens used for veri cation are different for each user. However, the performance degrades in case of stolen-token sce- nario. Pillai et al (2010) divide the iris into different sectors and apply a random projection on each sector. They concatenate the random projections of all sectors to derive a secure can- celable template. In this approach, the matching accuracy gets retained if subject-speci c projections are applied. Du et al (2011) propose a non-invertible transformation based on Gabor fea- tures. The radial position information (r) is combined with 64- bit Gabor descriptor to derive a cancelable template. Ouda et al (2010) incorporate the veri cation of a user based on group- ing blocks of consistent bits in the IrisCode. Both these approaches are vulnerable to correlation attacks for small block sizes (Ouda et al., 2011). Another way to achieve template security is through the use of cryptographic construct. Duagman et al (Duagman et al., 2006) derive a cryptographic key from 2048-bit IrisCode using the fuzzy commitment scheme.This utilizes Hadamard and Reed- Solomon error correcting codes to correct bit errors. The two schemes, fuzzy commitment and fuzzy vault, are introduced by Juels and Wattenberg (1999) and Juels and Sudan (2002), re- spectively. These approaches involve the exploitation of a biometric template into an error-correcting codeword with the addition of check bits. The main drawback of such schemes (Duagman et al., 2006; Juels and Sudan, 2002; Juels and Wattenberg, 1999) lies in the dif culty of generating exact error- free identi ers from noisy biometric features with high key entropy (Jain et al., 2008). In contrast, Dodis et al (2004) pro- posed secure sketch and fuzzy extractor schemes. These schemes use error tolerant key generation methods. Al- though, these schemes provide security against privacy invasion, they do not aim to provide revocability (Jain et al., 2008). To satisfy the four de ned criteria for an ideal biometric system, this paper presents a novel cancelable iris template generation method which employs a mapping between a decimal vector and a randomized binary look-up table. The decimal vector is obtained from the consistent bit vector par- titioned into a number of xed size blocks. The proposed method derives the protected template using check bits which are extracted from the mapped entries of the look-up table. The generated iris template is utilized for identity veri ca- tion instead of true IrisCode.The method involves a randomized look-up table mapping to achieve irreversibility. Moreover, dif- ferent values of block size and check bits are used to ful ll the requirements of diversity and revocability. The method in- volves a consistent-bit vector considering rotation-invariance into account to preserve the performance. This paper is an extension of our earlier work (Dwivedi and Dey, 2015). In the earlier work, we proposed a technique for generation of cancelable iris template. However, the limita- tions of our earlier work lie in aspects of accuracy, security and attack analysis. In a nutshell, we extend this work in the fol- lowing aspects as compared to our previous work: (i) Consistent bit vector is used to generate decimal vector instead of original row vector that results in performance improvement over the original IrisCodes. (ii) In the earlier work, the xed values of parameters are utilized to evaluate the performance. Here, we have per- formed exhaustive evaluation with the different values of parameters such as block size and check bits on CASIA IrisV3-Interval dataset. (iii) The earlier method was tested with only CASIA IrisV3- Interval. In this work, experiments have been carried out with CASIA-V 1.0, CASIA IrisV3-Interval and ICE 2005 (Phillips et al., 2008) datasets and experimental results are com- pared with existing approaches to determine the robustness of the proposed method. (iv) We have performed a rigorous security analysis with respect to revocability, irreversibility and diversity, and also tested our method against possible attacks such as corre- lation, hill-climbing and stolen-token attack in this work. (v) Finally, we have enhanced our literature review by adding descriptions of few more relevant existing approaches. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we brie y summarize existing methods related to the cancel- able iris template. Section 3 describes our proposed method in detail. The experimental results and comparison with the existing approaches are presented in Section 4. The security analysis of our method is discussed in Section 5. Finally, Section 6 summarizes our ndings and concludes the paper.

Related work In the last few years, several approaches have been proposed to address various issues of protecting biometric templates by the biometric research community. The approaches related to biometric template security presented in the literature can be widely categorized into two types namely, biometric cryptosystem and feature transformation (or cancelable bio- metrics) techniques (Jain et al., 2008). In the following, we shall discuss the existing techniques of both these two categories. Biometric cryptosystems may be further divided into two subcategories: key generation and key binding schemes. Key generation schemes (Chang and Roy, 2007; Dodis et al., 2004) are used to derive cryptographic keys from user s biometric fea- tures directly. On the other hand, the goal of key binding schemes (Duagman et al., 2006; Juels and Wattenberg, 1999) is to bind cryptographic keys with biometric features in such a way that it makes impossible to recover the key unless the true template is presented during authentication. However, the performance of key binding schemes may be affected due to the introduction of error correction schemes, which are nec- essary for key retrieval. It is obvious that although both key binding and key generation schemes offer protection to bio- metric templates; their main objective is to secure cryptographic keys using biometric features. Dodis et al (2004) applied a hash function on error-tolerant biometric input to attain non- invertibility. In this approach, two functions are proposed, namely fuzzy extractor and secure sketches. Fuzzy extractor applies a hash function on biometric input to generate a random string.This random string is utilized as a key. In contrast, secure sketch uses this random string to reconstruct the original tem- plate. Chang and Roy (2007) utilized this method on the ngerprint biometric. Another scheme for biometric cryptosystem proposed by Juels and Wattenberg (Juels and Wattenberg, 1999) is fuzzy commitment.This approach applies a function on the codeword and binary biometric input to gen- erate the template. The codeword is prepared with error- correcting codes to eliminate bit-errors. At the time of veri cation, the codeword is evaluated for the query biomet- ric data and matched using error-correcting codes. Bringer et al (2008) applied fuzzy commitment scheme (Juels and Wattenberg, 1999) with an improved error-correcting mechanism. In this approach, a matrix is formed with two different binary Reed Muller codes. Next, a 2-D iterative min-sum decoding is performed to retrieve a 40-bit cryptographic key. Wu et al (2008) proposed an iris cryptosystem based on key generation. The iris feature vector is corrected with Reed Solomon codes.Then, a hash function is applied to generate a cipher key. Reddy and Babu (2008) derived a key using password based transforma- tion to encrypt the fuzzy vault (Juels and Sudan, 2002). In contrast, the primary objective of the cancelable bio- metrics is to generate several revocable templates from the original biometric template. The different approaches for can- celable biometric introduced in the literature can be broadly categorized into two major primitives, namely biometric salting and non-invertible transforms (Rathgeb and Uhl, 2011). Bio- metric salting associates user-speci c auxiliary information with biometric data to generate a distorted variant of biometric template as similar to password salting (hardening) in cryptography. A well-known approach for biometric salting is biohashing which derives a uniformly distributed random se- quence using a hash key (Jin and Connie, 2006; Nanni et al., 2011; Teoh et al., 2008). In biohashing, biometric input is mixed with token and discretized in binary. The performance of the methods described in Jin and Connie (2006), Nanni et al. (2011), and Teoh et al. (2008) degrades in case of stolen-token sce- nario. In non-invertible transform based approach, instead of storing the original biometric, the biometric data are modi- ed using a one-way function and stored into the database to ensure security and privacy of the actual biometric trait. Ratha et al (2001) focused on different irreversible methods of gen- erating cancelable template such as grid morphing, block scrambling, Cartesian, polar and surface folding transforma- tion. The transformations can be applied in either the signal domain or the feature domain to achieve distortion to attain irreversibility, revocability and to avoid cross-matching in stored biometric data among the different databases. Du et al (2011) applied a key on the original iris template which rearranges the bit positions to achieve irreversibility. Zuo et al (2008) proposed four different non-invertible transforms namely GRAY-COMBO, BIN-COMBO, GRAY-SALT and BIN- SALT. GRAY-COMBO method performs circular shift operation on Gabor features and random addition of rows. BIN-COMBO utilizes similar transformation on the iris codes with random shifting and XOR operation. Random patterns are added to the Gabor features in GRAY-SALT method and XORed with origi- nal iris code in BIN-SALT method. Ouda et al (2010) derived BioCode by mapping randomly generated seed with biomet- ric features evaluated using biohashing algorithm (Teoh et al., 2008). These transformations produce lower recognition per- formance for noisy biometric data. Hammerle-Uhl et al (2009; 2013) applied mapping of permuted blocks with the source texture obtained using wavelet transform. The method (Hammerle-Uhl et al., 2009) was reported with signi cant per- formance degradation. Rathgeb et al (2013) proposed block permutation on iris textures to protect the iris template. However, they improved the performance by applying bloom lter to generate an alignment-free cancelable iris template (Rathgeb and Busch, 2014). The method (Rathgeb and Busch, 2014) suffers against the claim of unlinkability. 3. Proposed method In this section, we present the proposed method for genera- tion of secure cancelable iris template. Our work consists of a number of tasks as shown in Fig. 1. First, iris images are pre- processed using Masek s (2003) and Daugman s (2002) techniques. Then, IrisCode features are extracted in form of Pre- processing Feature extraction Rotation- invariant code generation Row vector formation Consistent bit extraction Decimal encoding Look-up table mapping Cancelable template generation Fig. 1 Block diagram of the proposed method.

Thereafter, rotation-invariant IrisCode is generated from the original IrisCodes and the rotation invariant IrisCode is transformed into a row vector. In the next step, we nd the consistent bits from the row vectors and generate the consistent bit vector which is used in decimal encoding. Finally, a look-up table is created to map the decimal encoded vector and to generate the cancelable template. These steps are discussed in the fol- lowing subsections. 3.1. Pre-processing The pre-processing includes iris segmentation followed by iris normalization and image enhancement. Segmentation is per- formed to extract the iris region and to remove the eyelids, eyelashes and other noises from the eye image to avoid per- formance degradation. In our approach, circular Hough transformation (Masek, 2003) is applied to detect the iris and pupil circles using the parameters: radius and center co- ordinates. First, iris boundary is detected from the eye image and then pupil boundary is located from the detected iris region instead of the whole eye image, since the pupil is always within the iris region. Eyelids are detected from the image using para- bolic curve parameter instead of the circle parameters (Masek, 2003). Due to illumination variations and the different imaging conditions, the radial size of the pupil may change accord- ingly.Therefore, the iris region is normalized using Daugman s rubber sheet model (Daugman, 2002; Masek, 2003) to compen- sate for these variations. Normalization process maps each point in the iris region to a polar coordinate. Thereafter, local his- togram analysis based enhancement technique (Masek, 2003) is applied to the normalized iris image. This reduces the effect of non-uniform illumination and produces a well-distributed texture image. Re ection regions are characterized by high in- tensity values close to 255 to avoid low contrast. A simple thresholding operation (Masek, 2003) is performed to remove the re ection noise. The details of techniques involved in pre- processing can be found in the report of Masek (2003). Fig. 2 shows the enhanced normalized iris image. 3.2. Feature extraction Normalized iris image is transformed into a 0 1 form of binary matrix by convolving 1-D Log-Gabor lter (Masek, 2003) to the normalized image. Each row in the normalized iris image is considered as a 1-D signal for convolution. The frequency re- sponse of 1-D Log-Gabor function is represented in Eq. (1). G f f f f ( ) = exp log log 0 2 0 2 2 (1) where f0 and represent center frequency and bandwidth of the lters, respectively. The function produces real and imagi- nary components which are phase quantized to get IrisCode in the form of 0 1. 3.3. Rotation-invariant code generation It is quite dif cult to match iris image with rotational incon- sistencies caused by tilt head while capturing the image. Even for genuine subject, it may result in poor intra-class Hamming distance (Daugman, 1985) causing performance degradation. We have measured the performance for original IrisCodes which shows an EER of 4.11 and 5.23 without applying cancelable transformation and after applying cancelable transforma- tion, respectively as listed in Table 1. Therefore, rotation invariance mechanism needs to be employed. The whole cir- cular iris pattern is considered to have 512 columns.Therefore, shifting of one column is equivalent to 360/512 = 0.703125 degree to a maximum of 8 columns (Daugman, 2002) generating 5.625 degree rotation. We consider 8-bit left as well as right rota- tions for each IrisCode of a particular subject. In order to achieve rotation invariance, we consider V number of IrisCodes per subject. The value of V is determined empirically (for details see Section 4.3). We randomly choose one IrisCode as refer- ence from all V IrisCodes. Hamming distances are calculated between the reference IrisCode and 17 other IrisCodes which are derived from each remaining IrisCode by shifting 8 columns in both directions one at a time.The IrisCode having minimum Hamming distance is further utilized to form row vector and consistent bit extraction. It may be noted that we are not storing any reference IrisCode as this would cause a direct leakage of target IrisCode if the database has been compromised. In the veri cation stage, the veri able template is exploited with 8-bit left and right ro- tations. The minimum distance is calculated using Eq. (2). min dist min Icode r shift Icode q k k _ = ( ) ( ) ( ) { } , (2) where min_dist represents the Hamming distance between ref- erence IrisCode (Icode(r)) and the given Iriscode (Icode(q)) with k number of shifts. Here, k varies from 8 to 8. k = 8 repre- sents 8 bits left shift and k = 8 represents 8 bits shift to right direction. 3.4. Row vector formation The rotation free templates are shift invariant in comparison to original IrisCodes. We have evaluated the performance for Fig. 2 Enhanced image after normalization. Table 1 Performance comparison of original IrisCodes and rotation-invariant IrisCodes.

Therefore, if we calculate Hamming distance between veri able and the stored templates of the same subject, the performance degradation is 0.04% which is very low. It is easy to apply any transformation on 1-D vector instead of 2-D matrix because we need to traverse in one direction only in the case of 1-D vector. For easier implementation, rotation-free iris samples are stored in row vectors by merging the next row to the previous one. The row vector (Rv) is formed as: R j i col dim Icode i j v + [ ] = ( ) _ , (3) where col_dim is the width of column and Rv is the output row vector for IrisCode (Icode). For example, a row vector of 1 24, which is obtained from the IrisCode of 4 6 is shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore, any transformation can be implemented on the row vector. 3.5. Consistent bit extraction After generating the row vector from all rotation-invariant IrisCodes, the consistent bits are extracted by considering sig- ni cant bits in the row vector. Consistent bits are those bits in IrisCodes which are less likely to change. The consistent bit vector (Cb) is derived after aligning and summing up V IrisCodes in order to examine the occurrence of corresponding bits. The consistent bit vector contains same number of bits as in row vector. Hollingsworth et al (2009) presented a mathematical proof for inconsistent bits and its impact on performance. The model observed that the probability (p) of a bit ip does not affect the False Accept Rate (FAR). However, bit ip rate affects the False Reject Rate (FRR) performance. Hence, we empiri- cally tested our approach with different values of p to improve the FRR. The bit indices that have higher probability of occur- rence across various samples of the same IrisCodes are collected in Cb. Moreover, the bits in the original IrisCodes are pro- tected using probability constraint. In this work, a bit is taken into account if the probability of occurrences is greater than or equal to the threshold pth, across the V row vectors as de ned in Eq. (4) and Eq. (5): C i for p i p elsewhere b th ( ) = ( ) 1 0  (4) p i R i V v v V ( ) = ( ) = 1 (5) where V is total number of samples of a subject and p i( ) is the probability of ith bit in the samples of a particular subject. We have chosen the value of V empirically and results are re- ported in Section 4.3. To test the effect of pth on FRR, we have considered four samples per subject (V = 4) in our experi- ment and results are shown in Table 2. The results reported in Table 2 show that FRR decreases gradually for p = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75. However, FRR increases when we consider p = 1, that means all bits of a particular position in four row vectors are same. The reason of getting higher FRR is that number of con- sistent bits are less for p = 1. Therefore, it has been concluded that masking out inconsistent bits using p = 0.75 improves the recognition accuracy rmly. 3.6. Decimal encoding It is dif cult to apply any transformation function into the entire consistent bit vector as it comprises of 32,768 bits. Therefore, consistent bit vector is partitioned into xed size blocks. The value of block-size (m) is considered as multiple of 2 to the power to get the consistent words of m bits. If it is not then the partition will not be perfect and some bits will be left over. The decimal vector is derived from the partitioned consis- tent bit vector.The conversion of a word from binary to positive integer seizes the right most bit as the least signi cant bit. For example, we consider the value of m = 4 for a given row vector 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 Fig. 3 Example of creating row vector.

The decimal vector will comprise large values of positive integers corresponding to large value of m. The words in the consistent bit vector are mapped to the corresponding decimal values. The mapping for given consistent bit vector is illus- trated in Fig. 5. 3.7. Look-up table mapping A binary look-up table (LUT) of size R C is generated with random values 0 and 1 for each user. Here, R and C represent the size of the decimal vector and the size of each word, re- spectively.The size of the table depends on the value of m.The LUT consists R = 2m and C = m number of rows and columns, respectively. The LUT is lled randomly as de ned here: LUT i j rand i and j m m , , , , , , , , , ( ) = ( ) = = ( ) 0 1 0 1 2 1 0 1 1 for (6) where LUT(i, j) represents the (i, j) position in the look-up table. For example, if we have word length 4, then the table must have at least 16 rows. To differentiate among the different words, we map the decimal vector to a corresponding word utilizing a look-up table. Fig. 6 illustrates the mapping procedure. More than one word can be mapped to the same positive integer which prevents the attacker to employ reverse mapping. There is a possibility that all entries of a particular row or more than one row are 0. In this situation, the use of these entries is vulnerable to privacy invasion attacks, as this makes impos- ter s task easy. Therefore, look-up table should maintain approximately same number of 0s and 1s in a randomized manner. 3.8. Cancelable template generation The mapping is performed between the decimal vector and the corresponding row of the LUT. Each row in LUT consists of m bits. We can choose d bits ( m) to generate the nal tem- plate. These bits are referred to as check bits. For example, if d = 2 as shown in Fig. 6, then 2 bits from the 2nd and 3rd po- sitions are selected from the mapped entries in the LUT. It may be noted that these 2 bits can be chosen from any position in the LUT. Therefore, the nal template consists of 12 bits if we choose 2 bits from each word as depicted in Fig. 7. Different templates can be derived using different values of m, but look-up table is kept xed for every m. If we select all bits from each block i.e. d = m, the number of matching will be less across all bits in the stored and veri able templates. Hence, performance will degrade. We have evaluated our method with different values of d for a xed value of m (please see Section 4.3, Table 4) and observed that performance 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 Fig. 4 Partitioned vector. 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 5 4 3 2 1 6 11 10 9 8 7 12 15 14 13 Fig. 5 Mapping of word to decimal vector. 0 1 0 1 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 10 0 1 0 1 11 12 13 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 1 0 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 d = 2 Fig. 6 Mapping from decimal vector to look-up table. 0 1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 Fig. 7 Final template.

Finally, matching is performed in the transformed domain by measuring the dissimilarity between two templates. We have computed Hamming distance between two templates to measure the dissimilarity. Hamming dis- tance (HD) is sum of non-equivalent bits (exclusive-OR) between stored and query templates as de ned in Eq.

Experimental results and comparisons In this section, we present the details of experimental design and results to illustrate performance of the proposed method and the effect of the different parameters as well as compari- son with the existing approaches. 4.1. Database We have chosen three widely used iris databases (CASIA-V 1.0, CASIA IrisV3-Interval, and ICE 2005) for evaluation of our pro- posed method.The CASIA-V 1.0 database consists of 756 images of 108 eyes. Each subject has 7 images captured in two ses- sions; 3 in the rst session and 4 in the second. The CASIA- iris V3 Interval database includes 2639 images captured from 249 different subjects. The prime motive behind using these datasets is to compare our proposed method with the exist- ing approaches in Du et al. (2011), Hammerle-Uhl et al. (2009, 2013), and Ouda et al. (2010) since their results are reported on the same dataset.The ICE 2005 Database (Phillips et al., 2008) from the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) consists of 2953 images composed of 244 subjects. The results obtained from this database are compared with Du et al. (2011). 4.2. Experimental design In our experiments, we have considered left and right eyes as different subjects because iris pattern is different for left and right eyes. We require 4 images per subject to create rotation invariant template at the time of enrollment and 1 image for veri cation. Hence, we consider the subjects which have at least 5 images. The experiment is performed on 348 subjects con- taining 177 subjects of left eye and 171 subjects of right eye iris patterns for CASIA-V3-Interval dataset. To evaluate im- poster score, iris template of each subject is matched against the corresponding templates of other subjects, yielding 1,197,019 different inter-class comparisons. To evaluate genuine score, each iris pattern is matched with other iris patterns of the same subject resulting to a total of 7223 different intra-class com- parisons. For ICE 2005 dataset (Phillips et al., 2008), the experiment is performed on 210 subjects containing 109 sub- jects of left eye and 101 subjects of right eye iris patterns resulting into 6560 intra-class comparison and 1,386,127 inter- class comparison. The experiment performed on CASIA-V 1.0 database outputs a total of 432 genuine comparisons and 80,892 imposter comparisons. To evaluate our method, each database is randomly divided into two partitions, keeping 4 samples in the rst partition and the rest in the second partition. The rst partition is utilized for enrollment and the second partition for veri cation.We have conducted a number of experiments using different param- eter values. We repeatedly perform each experiment 10 times as the enrollment and test samples are chosen randomly. The average performance for 10 trials is reported in the paper. We have used CASIA-V3-Interval database to choose the values of different parameters. We have also evaluated our method with CASIA-V 1.0 and ICE 2005 (Phillips et al., 2008) databases using the chosen parameter values. The ef ciency of the proposed method is evaluated by dif- ferent performance measures such as FAR, FRR and EER. FRR measures the probability of falsely rejecting an iris as an im- poster iris pattern and FAR measures the probability of falsely accepting an imposter iris pattern as genuine iris pattern. EER denotes the error rate where the FAR and FRR hold equality. Genuine Accept Rate (GAR) can be calculated using GAR = 1- FRR. The values of these performance metrics are evaluated from the genuine and imposter scores. Genuine score refers to matching an iris pattern of a subject with other patterns of the same subject, whereas imposter score is derived by com- paring an iris pattern of each subject against the iris patterns of all other subjects. The effectiveness of a biometric system can be illustrated graphically by plotting a Receiver Operat- ing Characteristic (ROC) curve with GAR against the FAR. 4.3. Validation of parameters The proposed method uses four parameters to generate the different cancelable templates. These parameters are: number of samples used for rotation-invariance (V), block-size (m), number of check bits (d) and different look-up tables. In this section, we highlight the impact of the different parameters on the performance of our approach.We have validated all these parameters with respect to CASIA-V3-Interval dataset. 4.3.1. Number of samples (V) used for rotation-invariance Before the formation of row vector, the derived IrisCodes are aligned to eliminate rotational deviation caused due to head tilt while acquisition. We consider V number of samples of the same user to achieve rotation-invariance. From the rotation- invariant IrisCode, we generate row vector followed by consistent bit vector, which considers the different probabil- ity values (p). To validate the parameter V and p, we have conducted a number of experiments with different values of V = 2, 3 , 6 and p = 0.33, 0.4, , 0.83. The performance is mea- sured with respect to EER and results are reported in Table 3. It has been observed experimentally that EER reduces for V > 3. For high values of V, the EER does not deviate much. There- fore, we have considered V = 4. The consistent bits are determined with different values of p. 4.3.2. Block size (m) The row vector is divided into xed size blocks of size m. The different values of m produce different Hamming distances for ARTICLE IN PRESS Please cite this article in press as: Rudresh Dwivedi, Somnath Dey, Ramveer Singh, Aditya Prasad, A privacy-preserving cancelable iris template generation scheme using decimal encoding and look-up table mapping, computers & security (2016), doi: 10.1016/j.cose.2016.10.004 7 c o m p u t e r s & s e c u r i t y ( 2 0 1 6 ) the same subject; therefore, the parameter m has an impact on the ef ciency of the proposed method. Moreover, a change in m may result in the generation of the different biometric templates.To validate the parameter m, we have evaluated the proposed method with m = 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32, and measure the performance with respect to ERR. We can also choose differ- ent values of d for each m. Table 4 shows the EER for the different values of m and d. From Table 4, we observe that the EER is high for m = 2 because of less variation in bits of different words. This leads to very low separability in intra-class comparisons. For m = 4, less value of EER is obtained as variability in bits increases for the different words. We also observe that for higher values of m, ERR is less as the bit difference is more. The ROC curves for different values of m with d = 2 are shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8 shows that the EER obtained for d = 2 are 2.08%, 1.73%, 1.49%, 1.47%, 1.47% for m = 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 respectively on CASIA-V3-Interval dataset. It has been ob- served that there is not much difference in EER for m = 16 and m = 32 respectively. Therefore, we conclude that m = 16 is the best value to preserve the performance.

Check bits (d) Final cancelable template is generated by selecting d bits from the mapped entries of the look-up table. The parameter d is responsible for security and revocability as various cancel- able templates can be generated by varying the value of d (see Table 8). The ROC curves for different values of d with m = 16 are shown in Fig. 9.The EER obtained for m = 16 are 1.47%, 0.43%, 0.82% and 1.04% for d = 2, 4, 8 and 16 on CASIA-V3-Interval dataset, respectively. It has been observed from Fig. 9 that d = 4 is the best value to preserve the performance.Therefore, it can be concluded that the best recognition accuracy is obtained for m = 16 and d = 4. 4.3.4. Effect of different look-up table The look-up tables are constructed using randomly gener- ated 0 1 values. Sometimes it may happen that a table is biased for either 0 or 1 that makes the proposed approach non- revocable. A modi cation in the look-up table leads to alter the random bits for deriving a new template. We have chosen two sets of different look-up tables. Both sets contains different look- up tables for different subjects, however the look-up table of a subject in the rst set is different from the look-up table of the same subject in other set. First, we have evaluated the per- formance with the m = 16 and d = 4 using rst set of look-up tables. Then, we perform the same experiment using second set of look-up tables. The ROC curves for the two experi- ments are shown in Fig. 10a,b. We observe EER of 0.43 and 0.46 with the rst and second set of look-up tables, respectively. Therefore, it is clear that change in the look-up table will less affect the overall performance. 4.4. Comparison of with and without transformation In this experiment, rst we computed the genuine and im- poster score using consistent bit vector of the original IrisCodes. Then, we apply the proposed approach to derive cancelable tem- plate. Matching between query and stored template is performed in the transformed domain. Table 5 shows the EER obtained from the original (unprotected) IrisCode and cancel- able template for different datasets. The reported results in Table 5 shows that performance is degraded by 0.09%, 0.093% and 0.329% for CASIA-V 1.0, CASIA-V3-Interval and ICE 2005 datasets, respectively. Therefore, we conclude that perfor- mance degradation produced by the transformation is very low. 4.5. Comparison with existing approaches We have analyzed the performance of proposed method for different values of parameters and observed that the best ac- curacy of EER = 0.43% is achieved corresponding to the parameter values m = 16 and d = 4.

The approaches in Bringer et al. (2008) and Wu et al. (2008) used CASIA-V 1.0, and the approaches in Hammerle-Uhl et al. (2009, 2013), Ouda et al.

The summary of the results of the existing approaches and our pro- posed approach are reported in Table 6. Form Table 6, we observe that the best result reported in existing literature is EER = 0.84 and EER = 1.06 for CASIA-V3-Interval and ICE 2005 (Phillips et al., 2008) dataset, respectively, whereas our ap- proach gives EER of 0.37, 0.43 and 0.79 for CASIA-V1.0, CASIA- V3-Interval, and ICE 2005 (Phillips et al., 2008) databases, respectively. From the reported result, it is evident that our ap- proach performs better for CASIA-V3-Interval and ICE 2005 (Phillips et al., 2008) dataset, respectively, over the existing approaches. 5. Security analysis A cancelable biometrics system needs to satisfy the security con- straints as described in Section 1. In this section, analysis of revocability, irreversibility and diversity of our method are dis- cussed to show that our approach ful lls the criteria for template protection schemes by preserving the recognition accuracy.The analysis of the different well known attacks against templates generated by our algorithm is also presented in this section. 5.1.

It is a necessary re- quirement for a biometric template protection scheme to generate numerous transformed templates from the same iris and they should differ with other templates to prevent cross- mating of templates across various applications. 1820 templates can be generated for the same sample of each subject corresponding to m = 16 and d = 4. We have se- lected 100 different templates randomly from this combination and matched with the original enrolled templates to obtain pseudo-imposter distribution. The mean and variance of genuine, imposter and pseudo-imposter distribution for dif- ferent values of m is shown in Table 7. Table 7 indicates that mean and variance for pseudo-imposter distribution is near to the imposter distribution and far from genuine distribu- tion. This signi es that the derived templates are dissimilar to enrolled templates for the same iris pattern. Although the templates are generated from same iris pattern, they are uncorrelated with each other. Therefore, claim of revocability is preserved. 5.2. Irreversibility analysis The term, irreversibility refers to the computational hard- ness in recovering the true IrisCodes. Recall that a randomized look-up table is maintained to map decimal entries and certain digits are selected from the mapped entries to generate a can- celable template. Moreover, our approach does not allow the storage of any parameter except the look-up table for each subject. Therefore, an imposter would need to learn the entire procedure to have any chance of compromising the security of the iris template. From the security frame of reference, ac- quiring the consistent bit vector of an IrisCode is as severe as recovering the true IrisCode itself since it contains the most signi cant bit information. Therefore, we apply a probability constraint for the evaluation of the consistent bit vector from the IrisCode. In addition to this, utilization of the different values of m, different look-up tables and selection of different d bits ensure robustness of the approach. In this section, we analyze three different scenarios to test the irreversibility of the method. 5.2.1. Compromised look-up table and protected template In this case, we assume that an attacker is able to reveal the stored look-up table and protected template of a user. From the size of the look-up table and protected template, the value of m and d may be computed. Now, to reconstruct the origi- nal IrisCode, the attacker has to compute the mapped locations in the look-up table from the protected template. For this purpose, rst attacker will divide the protected template (PT) into L number of bit sequences of the length of d bits where L Len d PT = as shown in Fig. 11. LenPT is the length of the pro- tected template. Next, each bit sequence would be searched in each row of the look-up table to nd the mapped location. The number of attempts required to nd a match correspond- ing to a bit sequence in a single row is m d C and m dP when d bits are taken from the look-up table to generate the pro- tected template in order and without any order, respectively. We denote this number of attempts as Mr. There are 2d pos- sible bit sequences in the protected template and 2m number of rows in the look-up table. Hence, the attacker requires 2d 2m Mr number of attempts to nd mapped locations for all bit sequences of the protected template from all rows of the look-up table. It may be noted that the substring match- ing cannot be utilized as the positions of d bits may not necessarily be consecutive. For example, if the length of the original template is 32,768; the value of m and d are 16 and 4, respectively, then the size of the protected template is 8192, and the number of attempts to nd possible mapped loca- tions for all bit sequences of the protected template is 1908 million and 45,801 million when d bits are selected in order and without any order, respectively, to generate the pro- tected template. Further, each bit sequence of the protected template can be found in multiple rows of the look-up table which could be considered as a set of possible mapped entries of that bit sequence. Fig. 11 shows that the set of possible mapped locations is 1 3 7 , , { } as the 2nd bit sequence is found in the 1st, 3rd and 7th rows in the look-up table. Similarly, the attacker can generate L number of sets of possible mapped locations corresponding to all bit sequences of the protected template. We assume that the number of possible mapped locations for the ith bit sequence is Ni. Hence, the total number of attempts to generate the original decimal vector from the sets of possible mapped locations is Table 7 Mean and variance of imposter ( i & i), pseudo-imposter ( pi & pi) and genuine distributions ( g & g) for different values of m.

As a result, the number of com- putations required to derive the decimal vector from the compromised look-up table and protected template is 2 2 d m r MT M N + . Moreover, even if the attacker derives the consistent-bit vector from the computed decimal vector; it would be hard to retrieve the original template as the at- tacker does not know the positions of consistent bits out of 32,768 bits. 5.2.2. Compromised protected template and value of m Assume that an attacker in ltrates the protected template and the value of m. In this scenario, an attacker has to reconstruct the look-up table and derive the decimal vector to obtain the original IrisCode. The reconstruction of the look-up table is computationally hard as the number of attempts required to reconstruct the original look-up table is 22m m because there are 2m m number of cells in the look-up table and the value of each cell is either 0 or 1.The reconstruction of look-up table is computationally hard as the number of attempts required to reconstruct original look-up table is 22m m for a look-up table of size 2m m. Now, there are 22m m possible look-up tables and the attacker has to derive the decimal vector corresponding to each look-up table. The number of computations required to generate decimal vector for single look-up table is 2 2 d m r MT M N + as discussed in Section 5.2.1. Therefore, the total number of computations required to derive the decimal vector from the compromised protected template and value of m is 2 2 2 2m m d m r MT M N + ( ). For example, we assume that the size of the look-up table is 16 4 and 2 bits are selected in order as well as without any order from the look-up table to generate the protected template.We also assume that the size of the protected template is 8 bits which contains 4 mapped locations and each set has 2 entries. The number of attempts required to generate the decimal vector is 7 4 1021 . when the bits are selected in order and 1 4 1022 . when the bits are not selected in any particular order. These values are comparable with those of Du et al (2011) and Hammerle-Uhl et al (2009) methods. 5.2.3. Compromised look-up table In this case, we assume that an attacker reveals the stored look- up table but no information about the protected template. In this situation, the value of m is known to the attacker. However, the attacker would not be able to reconstruct the original tem- plate as the look-up table comprises random 0 1 entries. From random 0 1 entries, it is impossible to retrieve any informa- tion about the true IrisCode. 5.3. Diversity analysis It is essential for a template protection mechanism that nu- merous derived templates should not match over various applications to avoid cross-matching. To evaluate this crite- rion, we employ different combination of m and d from the mapped row of the look-up table. The selection of d bits from the mapped instances in the look-up table can derive many templates for a particular subject. Table 8 shows the possible number of templates generated using different values of d. Further, we can also generate different templates by choos- ing different look-up tables. The parameters illustrated in Section 4 shows that mul- tiple templates can be generated for a single subject; they can still signi cantly be distinguished from the original template which means an individual can enroll different templates of the same subject at different physical applications without cross-matching. Therefore, the experiments validate the prop- erty of diversity. 5.4. Correlation attack To avoid correlation attack, the proposed approach uses dif- ferent values of m and d to derive multiple templates across various applications. If an imposter is able to reveal the two templates of the same user, it would not be possible to link the ith bit in two templates derived using different values of m and d. It is also possible to permute the bits in derived tem- plate or it can be XORed with a random sequence before deploying it to a new application. This random sequence will be dependent on the value of m. For example, if m = 4, random sequence will have 8192 bits, which is computationally hard to invent for an imposter. 5.5. Hill-climbing attack The primary idea behind hill climbing attack is to consecu- tively modify a biometric input to veri cation system in order to reconstruct the original IrisCode. The attacker observes the matching score returned by the system at each attempt and tries to maximize the matching score. The process of at- tempts with modi ed input continues until no signi cant improvement in matching score is observed. In our approach, we are considering consistent bit vector after aligning the dif- ferent IrisCodes.The bits which are less likely to change across the different IrisCodes of the same subject are treated as con- sistent bits. For example if we have four IrisCodes 0110, 0010, 0101 and 0100, then the consistent bit vector we consider is 0100. Here, the attacker needs to know the position of consis- tent bits to launch the hill-climbing attack. The consistent bits are selected based on probability constraint. Hence, the at- tacker has to match all possible bit vectors to obtain the desired score for veri cation. Moreover, the attacker has to apply all possible combination of parameters (m and d) to derive the can- celable template which is hard to invent. 5.6. Stolen-token scenario This is a scenario where the attacker has access to the genuine token.The stolen token, combined with his own biometric input is utilized for veri cation. If the attacker gets access to the block Table 8 Total number of possible templates.

This will avoid the condition of stolen- token and aid more revocability to our approach. Under stolen- token (same key) scenario, the experimental results are provided in Section 4.3. Our method achieves an EER close to 0% in case of different-key scenario. 6. Conclusion In this paper, we have proposed a novel cancelable iris tem- plate generation method which is able to derive a new and unique template from the original biometric template in case the stored transformed template is compromised. Further, the approach also satis es the four design criteria of irreversibility, revoca- bility, diversity and accuracy. The method utilizes the look-up table mapping to protect the original IrisCodes. Our approach uses 1-D Log-Gabor lter to generate iris code which is further partitioned into a number of xed size words. The proposed method generates bit strings or cancelable templates by mapping the decimal vector into the look-up table. The signi cant per- formance improvement is achieved by our approach as it involves consistent-bit vector over rotation invariant IrisCodes for en- rollment. We achieve 0.37%, 0.43% and 0.79% EER for CASIA- V1.0,CASIAV3-IntervalandICE2005databases,respectively,which indicates that our approach performs better than the existing approaches after applying the transformation. If the cancelable template is compromised, the parameters utilized in our ex- periment or the look-up table entries can be altered to derive another unique protected template. However, one limitation of our approach is that it requires 4 iris images per subject to gen- erate rotation invariant template which can be captured at the time of enrollment. Further, the accuracy is affected by the pre- processing task as it cannot properly segment the iris region for poor quality images. Hence, there is a scope of improvement in the segmentation process.Although the proposed method out- performs against stolen-token scenario, there is need for secure look-up table generation. In future work, these limitations can be addressed. In addition, the template security mechanism for multimodal biometric systems can be looked into the future.
