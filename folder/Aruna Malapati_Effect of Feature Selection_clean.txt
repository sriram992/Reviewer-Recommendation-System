The sulfur oxidation process is mediated mainly by dsr operon which is basically involved in the balancing and utilization of environmental sulfur compounds. DsrMKJOP complex from the dsr operon is the central player of this operon. DsrO is a periplasmic protein which binds FeS clusters responsible for electron transfer to DsrP protein from the dsr operon. DsrP protein is known to be involved in electron transfer to DsrM protein. DsrM protein would then donate the electrons to DsrK protein, the catalytic subunit of this complex. In the present work, we tried to analyze the role of DsrO protein of the dsr operon from the ecologically and industrially important organism Allochromatium vinosum. There are no previous reports that deal with the structural details of the DsrO protein. We predicted the structure of the DsrO protein obtained by homology modeling. The structure of the modeled protein was then docked with various sulfur anion ligands to understand the molecular mechanism of the transportation process of sulfur anion ligands by this DsrMKJOP complex. This study may therefore be considered as a rst report of its kind that would therefore enlighten the pathway for analysis of the biochemical mechanism of sulfur oxidation reaction cycle by dsr operon.

Gunjan (eds.), Computational Intelligence in Medical Informatics, Forensic and Medical Bioinformatics, DOI 10.1007/978-981-287-260-9_1 1 1 Introduction Sulfur oxidation reaction cycle is one of the important biogeochemical cycles in the world. Sulfur has a wide range of oxidation states viz., +6 to 2. This makes the element capable of taking part in a number of different biological processes. Sulfur- based chemo or photolithotrophy is one of such processes involving the transfer of electrons from reduced sulfur compounds like sul te, thiosulfate, elemental sulfur, etc. The sulfur oxidation process is mediated by a diverse set of microorganisms. Only little is known about the molecular mechanisms of this sulfur oxidation process in these microorganisms. One of the sulfur oxidizers is Allochromatium vinosum (A. vinosum), a dominant member of purple sulfur bacteria. This bacterium uses reduced sulfur compounds as electron donor for anoxygenic photosynthesis [1]. Recent studies with A. vinosum revealed that a multiple gene cluster comprising genes dsrA, dsrB, dsrE, dsrF, dsrH, dsrC, dsrM, dsrK, dsrL, dsrJ, dsrO, dsrP, dsrN, dsrS, and dsrR is involved in the sulfur oxidation process [2]. The organism A. vinosum has a wide range of applications in different industrial processes like waste remediation and removal of toxic compounds, e.g., odorous sulfur compounds like sul de and explosives and production of industrially relevant organo-chemicals such as vitamins, bio-polyesters, and biohydrogen [1]. It is well known that A. vinosum uses the DsrMKJOP protein complex to carry out the sulfur oxidation process [3]. DsrJ, a periplasmic protein, may be involved in the oxidation of a putative sulfur substrate in the periplasm and the released electrons would be transported across the membrane via the other components, viz., DsrO, DsrP, DsrM, DsrK successively, of the DsrMKJOP complex [3]. DsrO is a periplasmic iron-sulfur protein and is known to be involved in electron transfer process [2 4]. It is not yet known which amino acids of DsrO are involved in the electron transport or interact with sulfur anions. So, in this work, we have attempted to characterize DsrO protein at the structural level. We have predicted the putative active site geometry of the DsrO protein. In order to predict the molecular mechanism of the electron transport through DsrO protein we have docked the different sulfur anions present in the environment with DsrO protein. Till date there are no reports that deal with the analyses of the detailed structural information of DsrO as well as binding of sulfur anions with this protein to predict the mechanism of electron transport. This work is therefore the rst of its kind. Since there are no previous reports regarding the molecular and structural details of DsrO protein, our work would therefore be important to analyze the biochemical mechanism of sulfur oxidation process by this ecologically and industrially important microbial species. 2 S. Ghosh and A. Bagchi 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Sequence Analysis and Homology Modeling of DsrO Protein The amino acid sequence of DsrO protein from A. vinosum was obtained from Entrez database (Accession No. YP_003443232). To identify the presence of domains in DsrO protein, the amino acid sequence of DsrO protein was used to search Pfam [5]. The Pfam results have shown the presence of the domain 4Fe-4S dis-cluster spanning amino acid residues 125 224. This protein superfamily includes proteins that bind to iron-sulfur clusters. The amino acid sequence of DsrO protein has been used to search Brookhaven Protein Data Bank (PBD) [6] using the software BLAST [7] for nding suitable template for homology modeling. The BLAST search result of DsrO has revealed it to have 45 % identity with X-ray crystal structure of Polysul de (PsrABC) from Thermus thermophilus (T. thermo- philus) (PDB code: 2VPW) [8, 9]. The sequence alignment is shown in Fig. 1. The protein has been modeled using the corresponding crystal structure as template. Homology modeling has been performed using the software suite DS Modeling [MSI/ and Accelrys, San Diego, CA, USA]. The modeled structure has been superimposed on the crystal template without altering the coordinate system of atomic positions in the template. The root-mean- square deviation (r.m.s.d.) for the superimposition is 0.906 for DsrO with its template (Fig. 2). The model is then subjected to energy minimization using the CHARMm force eld [10] xing the backbone of the modeled protein to ensure proper interactions until the structure reached the nal derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol. 2.2 Validation of the Model The stereo-chemical qualities of the three-dimensional model obtained after energy minimization are checked by VERIFY3D [11] and PROCHECK [12] using Structural Analysis and Veri cation Server (SAVes).

Moreover, the average G factor, the measure of the normality degree of the protein properties, has been found to be 0.10, which is inside the permitted values for homology models. Furthermore, no distortions of the side chain torsion angles are found. The Ramachandran plot [13] has been drawn. No residues are found to be present in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. The residue pro le of the model has been checked by VERIFY3D and it indicates a good model quality. 2.3 Molecular Docking of DsrO with Sulfur Anions In order to identify the active site residues in DsrO protein, InterPro database was searched using the amino acid sequence of DsrO protein. The search result revealed that DsrO has similar domain architecture to InterPro entry IPR017900. It has been observed that four cysteine residues at amino acid positions 162, 165, 168, and 172 [IPR017900] are predicted to be involved in binding of sulfur anions. These active site amino acid residues are used for docking purposes. To study the interactions between DsrO and various sulfur anions that take part in sulfur oxidation process, the model of DsrO protein has been docked with sul te (SO3 2 ), sulfate (SO4 2 ), Fig. 2 Superimposition of the -carbon backbone of DsrO on 2VPW (B). DsrO is presented in red and 2VPW in green 4 S. Ghosh and A. Bagchi and thiosulfate (S2O3 2 ) using the program GOLD [14]. The docked complexes that have yielded the best GoldScore and ChemScore are selected and analyzed to study the interactions. 2.4 Molecular Mechanics Simulations of DsrO-Sulfur Anion Complexes The docked complexes of DsrO with different sulfur anions have been subjected to molecular mechanics simulations. During simulation, the backbone of the DsrO protein has been kept xed. The simulations have been performed in explicit solvent with a di-electric constant of 80. For the simulations, 2,000 cycles of steepest descent followed by 1,000 cycles of conjugate gradient methods have been used with CHARMm [10] force elds. The nal coordinates of the docked com- plexes have been saved for analyses. 2.5 Calculations for Protein Ligand Interactions The stereo-chemical qualities of the energy minimized docked complexes are checked by PROCHECK and VERIFY3D. The interactions between the sulfur anions and DsrO protein are then analyzed by DISCOVERY STUDIO software suite. 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Description of the Three-Dimensional Structure of DsrO from Allochromatium vinosum The DsrO protein from A. vinosum has a functional domain consisting of 95 amino acids. The modeled structure is similar to X-ray crystal structure of Polysul de Reductase (PsrABC) from T. thermophilus strain HB27 (PDB code: 2VPW, Chain B). The predicted structure of DsrO protein from A. vinosum consists of a mixture of helices, coils, and sheets (Fig. 3). The functional domain starts with a coil (amino acid residues 127 136) followed by a helix (amino acid residues 137 140). Then, there are two beta sheets (amino acid residues 147 149 and 155 157) and three helices (amino acid residues 167 171, 205 210, 216 219) joined by nine coil regions (amino acid residues 142 146, 150, 158, 162 166, 172 204, 211, 214 215, 220 221). Analysis of the Structural Details of DsrO Protein 5 3.2 Putative Active Site Geometry of DsrO from Allochromatium vinosum DsrO belongs to the 4Fe-4S ferredoxin, iron-sulfur binding family of proteins. Proteins belonging to this class are involved in transport of electrons in a range of metabolic reactions; they fall into several subgroups according to the nature of their iron-sulfur cluster(s) [15, 16]. The various Fe-S sites found in many electron transfer proteins (e.g., ferredoxins) are also found in many enzymes, where these centers are involved in intra or inter-protein electron transfer processes. For example, sul te reductase contains a siroheme and Fe4S4 center, which are strongly coupled and involved in the six electron reduction of SO3 2 to H2S [17]. In most ferredoxins, the protein ligands are cysteines, which provide four thiolate donors to the 1Fe, 2Fe, or 4Fe centers [17]. IPR017900 entry represents at least one con- served domain, including four cysteines residues that bind to a 4Fe-4S center. Alignment of the amino acid sequence of DsrO from A. vinosum has revealed that DsrO also has four cysteine residues at the identical positions viz., Cys162, Cys165, Cys168, Cys172. During molecular docking in GOLD program Cys168 was used as the binding site of DsrO protein with the sulfur anions as it covers all the required exible side chains for docking. The exible side chains of the amino acid residues which are mainly involved in the interactions with sulfur anions are listed in Table 1. This positioning of the amino acid residues is known to play an important role in ligand binding described in the next section. Fig. 3 Three-dimensional model of DsrO protein. The helices are shown in red. The strands are presented in yellow.

Ghosh and A. Bagchi 3.3 GOLD Docking Scores for Protein Ligand Interactions The energetics of DsrO-sulfur anion interactions were calculated by considering the parameters of GOLD program as listed in Table 2. We have used thiosulfate, sul te, and sulfate anions as the potential sulfur substrates since the actual sulfur anion ligand is not yet known clearly. From the GoldScore tness values among three complexes it may be safely concluded that DsrO protein binds strongly with thiosulfate. It was previously shown that sul de/thiosulfate grown cells show high expression of DsrO protein [4]. Now, from these docking complexes it is con rmed that thiosulfate is the most suitable ligand among the different sulfur anions. 3.4 Interactions of DsrO with Sulfur Anions The binding energy values associated with the docked complexes of DsrO-thiosulfate, DsrO-sulfate, and DsrO-sul te are presented in Table 3. It has also been observed that more number of amino acid residues of DsrO protein is involved in binding with thiosulfate as compared to other sulfur anions (Fig. 4). The amino acid residues Cys142, Gly164, Cys165, Tyr167, and Cys168 from DsrO protein are involved in binding with thiosulfate. On the other hand, for DsrO-sul te complex the amino acids Gly164, Cys165, Arg166 are involved in binding, whereas for DsrO-sulfate complex, the amino acid residues Cys162 and Gly164 are involved in binding (Figs. 5 and 6). From this analysis it is apparent that DsrO protein binds strongly with thiosulfate as greater number of amino acid residues are involved in interactions. Thiosulfate being the largest of the three sulfur Table 2 Comparative values of GOLD program of protein ligand complexes Protein ligand complex name GoldScore tness ChemScore DG ChemScore H-bond weighted DsrO-thiosulfate 36.9534 16.0675 10.5875 DsrO-sulfate 30.7964 13.9717 8.4917 DsrO-sul te 26.9615 17.7079 12.2279 Table 3 Binding energy calculations of protein ligand complexes Docked complex Total binding energy of the protein ligand complex Energy of the complex Entropy DsrO-thiosulfate 0.0975 3717.26643 17.03740 DsrO-sul te 0.55491 3671.98443 17.01440 DsrO-sulfate 0.31514 3655.62403 16.59680 Analysis of the Structural Details of DsrO Protein 7 anion ligands used has the maximum chance of interactions with the protein. On the other hand in sulfate, the sulfur atom has the highest oxidation state of +6. Hence, sulfate has no ability to be oxidized and is not used in the oxidation process.

Ghosh and A. Bagchi 4 Conclusions In this study we elucidate the structural basis of the involvement of DsrO protein from A. vinosum in electron transport during the oxidation of sulfur compounds. We built the three-dimensional structure DsrO protein using comparative modeling technique. The dockings of sulfur anions with DsrO allowed us to identify the details of their mode of interactions. We identi ed the amino acid residues from the DsrO protein that are involved in the binding of DsrO protein with sulfur anions. Results from this study will be important for understanding the pathway of electron transport via this protein in the global sulfur cycle. This homology model of DsrO provides a rational framework for designing experiments aimed at determining the contribution of amino acid residues responsible for electron transport via dsr operon.

Bagchi LCMV Interaction Changes with T192M Mutation in Alpha-Dystroglycan Simanti Bhattacharya, Sanchari Bhattacharjee, Prosun Kumar Biswas, Amit Das, Rakhi Dasgupta and Angshuman Bagchi Abstract Limb girdle muscular dystrophy (OMIM: 613818) is a severe disease in humans, which broadly affects brain development. The disease is caused by T192M mutation in the protein alpha-dystroglycan ( -DG). -DG is an important compo- nent of dystrophin dystroglycan complex which links extracellular matrices with actin cytoskeleton and thereby maintains signalling cascades essential for the development of tissues and organs. The mutation T192M in -DG hampers proper glycosylation of -DG thereby developing limb girdle muscular dystrophy. Pro- totype virus for Old World Arenaviruses (OWV), Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) also uses this -DG as host cell receptor and invades the host cell causing a disease called Lymphocytic choriomeningitis, an infection to meninges. Thereby, interaction of -DG and LCMV has become an interesting object of study to predict the mode of the disease onset. In our current work, we have used homology modelling, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) with temperature variation. We have identi ed signi cant structural differences between wild type (WT) and mutant (MT) -DG in terms of spatiotemporal orientations of amino acids. This change in the folding patterns of the WT and MT -DG has brought forth a different interaction pattern of the WT and MT -DG with GP1 protein from LCMV as re ected in our docking simulations. Further MD simula- tions with the complexes over tropical and temperate environment have revealed that MT- -DG-LCMV GP1 complex is relatively more stable than the wild type counterpart. It has also been found that LCMV GP1 has interacted strongly with mutant -DG. Our studies therefore has shed light on the structure and molecular interaction pattern of LCMV with MT -DG and also indicate a possibility of T192M mutant in -DG making the receptor to interact strongly with LCMV GP1. These insights also provide clues to develop possible therapeutic approaches. Keywords Homology modelling  Molecular dynamics  Limb girdle muscular dystrophy  Viral infection-drug design S.

Molecular dynamics run with temperature variation shows interaction of LCMV with mutated receptor is stronger than the wild type receptor. 1 Introduction Dystroglycan (DG) is a cell surface receptor and it belongs to dystrophin dystro- glycan complex whichlinks extracellular matrices with cellular actin cytoskeleton [1]. Cellular actin cytoskeleton plays crucial role in development of tissues, organs not only by providing mechanical strengths to cells but also by taking active part in regulating macromolecular events [2] required for proper development [3]. Matured DG protein is composed of twosubunits: alpha-dystroglycan ( -DG), the extracellular part of DG that interacts and receives signals from extracellular proteins like laminin, parlecan, argin, etc. and beta dystroglycan ( -DG), which remains bound to cell membrane [1]. This -DG is linked with cellular dystrophin, which is an active acin binding protein [4]. The protein -DG contains a mucin like region sandwiched between its N terminal and C terminal globular parts. This mucin rich region is essential for the proper glycosylation and functioning of -DG [1]. Reportedly, a point mutationT192M in -DG causes limb girdle muscular dystrophy, MDDGC9(OMIM: 613818) affecting brain and nervous system growth resulting in severe cognitive impairments, mental retardation and delayed motor development [5, 6]. This mutation actually hampers LARGE (a transacetylase) mediated glycosylation leading to the disease onset. This signi es the role of -DG in development and muscle strength. Interestingly, -DG also serves as a receptor to a large class of arenaviridae (AV), Old World viruses (OWV) [7]. OWVs invade host system by its preglycoprotein complex which has three major components: N terminal stable signal peptide (SSP), followed by glycoprotein G1 (GP1 *42 kDa) and glycoprotein G2 (GP2 *35 kDa) domains [7]. These viruses interact with the N terminal few amino acids and mucin 12 S. Bhattacharya et al. rich region of -DG via their GP1 for attachment and fusion to the host system. Some of these AVs are also causative agents of diseases like lassa fever, Bolivian hemor- rhagic fever, lymphocytic choriomeningitis (LCM), etc. causing signi cant mortality in affected human populations [8]. The prototype for OWV, Lymphocytic Chorio- meningitis Virus (LCMV) causing LCM, a chronic asymptomatic, lifelong infection of meninges which is the membrane to protect central nervous systems [9, 10]. This has tempted us to study the molecular interaction pattern of -DG and LCMV GP1. Although detailed studies have been carried out on LCMV regarding its global distribution, pathogenicity, residues essential for its interaction with -DG [8], the insight to its molecular interaction with MT -DG is still not deciphered. Therefore, we have ventured into the prediction of molecular aspects of disease propagation. We have taken a homology modelling approach to construct the model of LCMV GP1 domain and thereafter have docked this model with wild type (WT -DG) and T192M mutant (MT -DG) forms of -DG separately. Our initial studies [6] with -DG structures have also revealed that the mutant structure differs signi cantly in terms of its surface hydrophobicity in vicinity to the mutation site, 192. That is why we have focused on the structural changes occurring in the vicinity of mutation site and its effect on the binding orientation of LCMV GP1 with MT -DG to elucidate the effect of the above-mentioned mutation. Molecular docking and subsequent molecular mechanistic simulations for the rst time have revealed that MT -DG has increased numbers of intermolecular hydrogen and hydrophobic bonds with LCMV GP1 establishing a stable interaction. Further we have employed MD with elevated tem- perature to monitor the changes in this interaction pattern. This study therefore for the rst time sheds some light into the scenario where MT- -DG interacts with LCMV. And we have observed the pattern indeed changed with mutated receptor protein. In future, this work will be helpful in designing some effective therapeutic approaches to defeat the virus borne disease. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Template Search First, the sequence of LCMV GP1 domain, comprising amino acid residues 88 241, was extracted from UniprotKB (id: E2D674). This was then used as input sequence to search for the template in FUGUE [11] and pdb [12] using PSI-BLAST [13]. In both the cases, the A chain of crystal structure of envelope glycoprotein Machupo virus GP1 (PDB code: 2WFO) was obtained as the closest match. 2.2 Homology Modelling This structure was then used as template to construct homology model for LCMV GP1 using modbase [14] web server with sequence-sequence, pro le-sequence LCMV Interaction Changes with T192M Mutation 13 (PSI-BLAST) and sequence-pro le (Modeller Built-Pro le) methods. Since the template is a model of New World virus- Machupo virus GP1, the modelling of our desired protein was not so straightforward. So, alternatively, model for this region (amino acid residues 88 241) has also been constructed using I-TASSER and RaptorX model building servers independently. Both these servers used 2WFO as the template. The models so generated were then superimposed on the previously built model to generate as consensus report (Supplementary File 1). All models were tested with Verify 3D [15] and PROCHECK [16]. We have also denatured the structure completely taking it up to 373 K starting from 273 K, then have allowed it to cool down to 273 K. And the structures were then superimposed in order to check for the folding accuracy. The Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) for these two superimposed les have been found to be 0.8 (Supplementary File 2) which implies that they are indeed identical and the folding patterns are conserved. 2.3 Molecular Docking Next, we used this model to dock with WT -DG and MT -DG [6] separately using Z dock [17], PyDock [18] and Patchdock [19]. Docked complexes with best score and lower energy were selected and there were total 25 docked complexes (5 from Z dock, 10 from Pydock and 10 from Fire Dock) for each type of complex, i.e. WT- -DG with LCMV and MT- -DG with LCMV. Resultant docked com- plexes were then energy minimized keeping their backbones xed to ensure proper interactions. 800 cycles of conjugate gradient energy minimization steps were applied with CHARMm [20] force eld until the structure reached a nal derivative of 0.01 kcal/mole. After each minimization, the structures were veri ed with Verify3D and PROCHECK. Further analyses of the docked complexes were done using Discovery Studio (DS) package version 2.5 and Protein Interaction Calculator [21]. Binding sites were detected with analyse binding site tool from DS for all the docked complexes to validate the docking process. Finally, the complexes with the lowest energy pro le and with binding sites consensus with literature [8, 10] have been selected for wild type and mutated complexes. The complexes were then further subjected to minimization in explicit solvent system with CHARMm force eld. Dielectric constant of the molecular surface was kept 80 as of periodic water bound condition. 2.4 Molecular Dynamics Simulations Minimized complexes then were brought to elevated tropical temperatures (i.e. 300 320 K) and 10,000 time step of production run was performed in each of the cases keeping pressure constant. The conformational changes were recorded and plotted against time. 14 S. Bhattacharya et al. 3 Results 3.1 The Conformation of MT -DG Contributes to Altered Interaction with LCMV GP1 Our studies [6] with the models of both WT and MT -DG initially have gured out that mutant structure has more buried surfaces than that of its wild type form. In order to investigate further the art of interactions, we have docked LCMV GP1 with WT and MT -DG, separately. Analyses of docked pattern of the models clearly have re ected that there are indeed signi cant differences both in terms of amino acid residues involved in interaction as well as the spatiotemporal orientation of LCMV GP1, docked with either WT or MT -DG (Fig. 1a). As mentioned earlier, the focus of our study was the immediate vicinity of mutation site at the amino acid residue position 192. And we have marked those amino acid residues 88 96 of LCMV GP1 have successfully interacted with a groove formed by amino acid residues 142 192 of -DG (Fig. 1b). We have attempted to analyse the total number of intermolecular hydrogen bonds (H-bond) and hydrophobic interactions (HPI) formed between LCMV GP1 and -DG in both the cases, in two different systems, i.e. discovery studio 2.5 and protein interaction calculator. Normalized average values of the bonds formed have been used to generate a graphical view (Fig. 1c) which re ected that LCMV-GP1 docked with MT -DG had more numbers of H-Bonds and HPI interactions than the bonds formed for its docked model with WT- -DG (left panel, Fig. 1c). Hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions are the non-covalent interactions which are meant to stabilize the overall interaction occurring between two proteins [22]. Disturbance in these bonds will de nitely affect the binding. Studies with the structures in further details have marked this dispute to be largely contributed by a huge structural change in mutant form of -DG in vicinity to the mutation site (Met 192) that has resulted in a new space for LCMV GP1 interaction and also has created potentially altered kinks among few residues (arrows, Fig. 1d, e). Superimpositions of models of WT and MT- -DG, minimized with either vacuum [6] or explicit solvent condition (Supplementary File 3) have revealed that there indeed exist structural differences between the two structures. 3.2 Identical Amino Acids Bent Differentially to Give a New Conformation to Mutant -DG Further assessment of the afore mentioned portion of -DG has identi ed amino acid stretch 166 171 of -DG to be the key to these disputes. The relative bends and positioning of these residues have formed a surface which is more closed or buried in MT -DG than that of its wild type form (Fig. 2a). Surprisingly, dihedral angles between the adjacent residues in this patch, i.e. Ser166-Val167, Val167-Arg168, LCMV Interaction Changes with T192M Mutation 15 Fig. 1 LCMV GP1 exhibited a different spatiotemporal orientation when interacted with MT -DG. a Docked structures of LCMV GP1 (red backbone, yellow surface) with WT- -DG (blue backbone, left panel) and with MT -DG (blue backbone, right panel).

Bhattacharya et al. Thr169-Ala170 and Ala170-Ser171, have possessed almost 180 change in two structures of -DG (Fig. 2b). The corresponding changes of the angles are: Ser166-Val167 ( 175.90) (177.41), Val167-Arg168 (178.42) ( 177.36), Thr169-Ala170 (178.12) ( 178.39) and Ala170-Ser171 ( 178.18) (178.97) from WT MT -DG. Only amino acid pair Arg168-Thr169 (175.32 176.11) has similar dihedral angle in both the forms of -DG.

The serological prevalence of the virus has been reported to be centralized in Africa, but disease distribution occurs worldwide. Studies with patients suffering from lymphocytic choriomeningitis have revealed that this disease is prevalent in temperate zone [23]. Moreover, majority of Old World viral diseases occur at tropical and temperate regions [24]. So, we have employed MD run with a temperature range 27 47 C so that we can monitor the changes in the interaction occurring between the receptor, -DG and its ligand, LCMV-GP1. Changes in RMSD of the conformations over time in three different temperatures, i.e. 27, 37 and 47 C (300, 310 and 320 K, respec- tively) have clearly demonstrated that the complex of MT- -DG and LCMV-GP1 shows less alteration in RMSD with temperature change than the complex of WT- -DG and LCMV-GP1 does. In other words, the interaction between MT- -DG and LCMV-GP1 is much more stable than its wild type counterpart (Fig. 3). 4 Discussions LCM, an infection of meninges which serve as a protective membrane for central nervous system, is developed due to the invasion of its causative agent LCMV to host system via -DG, a host cell surface receptor and this interaction is largely counted on LARGE mediated proper glycosylation of matured -DG. Additionally, Fig. 3 Effect of temperature on the interactions. a, b RMSD versus Time plots exhibit that in case of the complex of LCMV GP1 with wild-type receptor has shown greater deviation in RMSD for the conformations (a). On the contrary, complex of LCMV GP1 with the mutated receptor has less conformational changes (b) with change in temperatures 18 S. Bhattacharya et al. a mutant form of this -DG (T192M) hampers LARGE mediated glycosylation resulting in altercation in signalling cascade essential for proper brain development. Patients with T192M mutation in -DG develop severe mental retardations along with cognitive impairment. These common features of the two diseases, i.e. dependence on LARGE, involvement of -DG, proper glycosylation and above all affecting nervous system, brain, have made the interaction of LCMV and -DG an invincible study object to us. In our current work, we have found that amino acid stretches 166 171 of -DG in the close vicinity to mutation site of Met 192 have contributed to structural bends which nally have created relatively more buried conformation for MT -DG than that of wild type one. Majority of amino acid pairs have almost 180 orientation difference in their dihedral angles which imply that replacement of polar Thr 192 with non-polar Met has conferred structural strains to the positional orientations of its upstream and downstream amino acids. Because of this, mutant form of -DG has possessed a buried conformation with those amino acid stretches which otherwise have a widened window in the wild type -DG. And this has forced LCMV GP1 to occupy a different space for interaction with MT -DG. But this has been proven to be advantageous for the interaction of the two participating proteins since interaction of LCMV GP1 with -DG has more main backboned based H-Bonds formed, compared to its interaction with WT- -DG. And these same results have also been re ected with solvent explicit models. Interestingly, this result has an indication of likelihood of susceptibility to LCMV infection in the presence of the T192M mutation. This has urged us to look for the possible fold pattern of LCMV GP1 that can serve as a potential blocking site to restrict the disease propagation. In our study, as we already have shown that stretch of amino acids 88 96 of LCMV GP1 has remained a common mediator of inter- actions for both WT and MT -DG and it also has possessed a particular fold pattern. In future, analysis of this structure will enlighten a path for developing novel therapeutic approaches against this viral transmission. Moreover, tempera- ture-based variation on the conformations from our MD run have revealed that the interaction of LCMV GP1 and -DG with T192M mutation is signi cantly stable than the interaction of LCMV GP1 with the wild type receptor. In conclusion, our experiments have shed lights on the molecular interactions of LCMV GP1 with MT -DG, for the rst time of its kind. Experimental results, here, have shown that structural aberrations in mutant -DG owing to the altered bends in its amino acids residues have lead to changes in its interaction pattern with LCMV GP1. But this changed spatiotemporal orientation nally has resulted in strong binding of LCMV GP1 with MT -DG, compared to WT- -DG as is revealed by MD simulations and hydrogen bond analysis. This indicates a likelihood of LCMV susceptibility when -DG possesses T192M mutation. T192M mutation is a naturally occurring mutation in human causing structural changes of the protein and subsequently diminishing the effective signal transduction. Blocking the activity of this mutant form with small antagonists may anyway hamper the process. Gene therapies that deliver functional transcript of the protein may ameliorate the ill effect of the mutation. But from this study, we have found that LCMV GP1 has stronger interactions with the mutated form than the wild type one. That implies an effective LCMV Interaction Changes with T192M Mutation 19 therapeutic strategy should be developed against the viral protein to block the interaction of LCMV GP1 with the host receptor protein. Studying the particular folding pattern (s) of LCMV GP1 in near future may lead the path to develop new potential therapeutic approaches to bar the spread of this viral transmission. The only licensed drug available to certain diseases caused by Arenaviruses is nucleoside analogue ribavirin [25]. A detailed analysis of this interaction with total protein model will generate deeper insight to the molecular basis of the viral attachment to mutant protein. Our future study therefore includes (i) homology modelling of total -DG with its mutant form as well as that of LCMV GP1, (ii) docking simulations followed by thereafter analyses of the interactions and (iii) small molecular library screening to nd effective molecule against the viral GP1.

These motifs bind the polyproline rich ligands. While the WW domains of animal origin are well characterized, the same from plant origin are not well documented yet. Despite the small repertoire of WW proteome of plants (in comparison to animal WW proteome) functional diversity is reported to be equally vivid for plants also. Here, for the rst time, we report the structural and functional properties of an Arabidopsis thaliana (At) WW domain containing protein F4JC80 by using homology modeling and docking techniques. Our ndings report that the At F4JC80 protein contains two WW domains which bear the standard triple sheet structure and structurally and functionally resemble Class I WW domains of E3 ubiquitin ligase family but their structural differences impact their polypeptide binding abilities differently.

Gunjan (eds.), Computational Intelligence in Medical Informatics, Forensic and Medical Bioinformatics, DOI 10.1007/978-981-287-260-9_3 25 evolutionary forces often enable protein domains to accommodate more sequence variations keeping the overall structural folding pattern intact. One such great example is the WW domain which is known to be the smallest protein module (only 30 40 amino acids long) that is able to fold independently in solution [1]. This domain harbors its name from the presence of two conserved tryptophan residues residing toward the two termini of this 30 amino acids stretch [2]. Other than the two conserved residues, there are 2 3 aromatic amino acids, mostly tyrosine, are found in the middle of this domain and a conserved proline residue is located at the end of this domain [1]. Other than these 4 5 conserved residues, the remaining parts of these WW domains are found to be highly variable in nature. Despite this huge sequence variation, this small 30 40 amino acids stretch of a WW domain is always found to fold into a triple sheet structure where the individual sheets are generally connected by small turns [1, 2]. However, the lengths of the individual sheets vary greatly among different WW domains. Generally, proteins or peptides containing polyproline rich regions act as ligands of this small protein module. Different WW domains interact with polyproline rich ligands or polypeptides (PRL/PRP) of different compositions and lengths. Based on their PRL/PRP choices, WW domains are classi ed into ve different classes [1]. Among these ve classes, class I WW domain comprises of E3 ubiquitin ligases like NEDD4, ITCH as well as transcription regulator like YAP1 and oxidoreductase WWOX (NEDD4: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase NEDD4/Neural precursor cell expressed developmentally down-regulated protein 4; ITCH: E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase Itchy; YAP1: Yorkie homolog/65 kDa Yes-associated protein; WWOX: WW domain containing oxidoreductase; APBB1: Amyloid beta A4 precursor protein-binding family B member 1; FBP/FNBP: Formin binding protein; WBP: WW domain binding protein). Proteins like FBP11 and Prp40 which are part of the eukaryotic splicing machinery form the Class II and Class V, respectively, while prolyl isomerases like Pin1 is the sole member of the Class IV. Other WW domain containing proteins like FE65 (also known as APBB1) and FBP21 (also known as WBP4) form the class III WW domains. Salah et al. [1] in their review about WW domains have mentioned in details about the speci c ligand choices of each class of WW domains [3 8]. Irrespective of this small length, the functional impact of WW domain is enormous and it is found to be associated with all the above-mentioned cellular phenomena. It is often associated with large cellular protein networks. Diseases like Alzheimer and Huntington disease are also associated with different WW domain containing proteins (WW-CP) who s altered or impaired interactions are associated with these disease prognosis [1]. Like the functional diversity the distribution and architectural diversity of WW domains are also signi cantly diversi ed. The pfam WW domain family (http://www.pfam.xfam.org) consists of 8,927 WW domain sequences form 357 species with 403 different architecture. Over the last decade, the WW domain has been structurally and functionally well characterized. Unfortunately most of these studies whether cellular, biochemical, structural, or at organism level, have been associated with WW domains of either animals or fungi. Studies about plant WW domain is restricted to a handful of articles despite the ndings that WW domains of plants are also associated with 26 A. Das et al. diverse cellular events like inhibition of plant virus replication, cuticle develop- ment, plant owering time control, morphological development, RNA processing, and prolyl isomerization [9 14]. While the last two functions are quite common to the WW domain family, others are speci c to plants. Considering the conserveness of different pathways involving RNA processing and prolyl isomerization, it would not be surprising to nd out the involvement of WW domains in similar events of plants. In this context, it is also surprising that the functional diversity of the plant WW domains have not been well addressed yet. While plants are much less diversi ed in terms of their WW proteome (Table 1) when compared to that of animals, the WW domain-related studies of model plants like Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) and Oryza sativa (O. sativa) are signi cantly limited. Without better understanding of the plant WW domain functions and their involvement in different cellular events, it would not be possible to speci cally categorize the similarities and differences of plant and animal WW domains, their PRL/PRP preferences as well as their respective protein interactions. Especially characterization of those WW domains and WW-CPs that are involved in evolutionary conserved processes like RNA processing, prolyl isomerization, protein turnover would provide signi cant insight into better understanding of these essential cellular processes that encompass all kinds of eukaryotes. In this context, we have undertaken homology modeling- and docking-based studies to characterize and functionally annotate the uncharacterized WW-CPs of model plants like A. thaliana. As described in Table 1, the A. thaliana WW proteome consists of only 28 proteins (22 unique sequences and six redundant sequences) which has a total of 41 WW domain sequences. Among these 22 unique sequences, 8 are yet to be functionally annotated while others were reported to be involved in most of the above-mentioned plant WW domain functions. Among these eight uncharacterized proteins, this study reports about the structural and functional characterization of Table 1 Comparison of WW-CP proteome of plants and animals Serial no.

While vertebrates (like human, mouse, or zebra sh) contain more than 100 WW domain containing proteins and even larger amounts of WW domain sequences (on average 1.5 WW domains per protein), variation of plant (A. thaliana and O. sativa) WW domains is much less, even in comparison to Arthropods (fruit y). However, the functional diversity of plants and animals are comparable (details in text) Structural and Functional Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana 27 one such A. thaliana WW-CP, annotated as WW domain containing protein (Uniprot ID: F4JC80) which harbors two WW domains. (During the rest of the article, this protein will be mentioned as At F4JC80). 2 Materials and Methods The amino acid sequence of At F4JC80 (Uniprot KB ID: F4JC80, NCBI Accession number: NP_001154613.1) was retrieved from Uniprot KB (http://www.uniprot.org) and its corresponding conserved domain regions were identi ed via pfam [15]. The pfam output showed the presence of two WW domains in At F4JC80. The pfam identi ed WW domain regions were further used for homology modeling and sub- sequent docking and functional annotation studies. For structural and functional characterization of a protein, it is essential to generate stereo-chemically t structures that can be further used in different studies. Although there are couple of models of WW domains available at the Swiss Model repository for the protein of our interest, none of the models were found to be stereo- chemically t. Thus, fresh models for the WW domains of At F4JC80 were required to be built. To identify potential templates for homology modeling of the At F4JC80 WW domains, NCBI PSI-BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE= Proteins) was performed against the protein databank (PDB) (http://www.rcsb.org) using the At F4JC80 WW domain region sequences as query sequences. For the BLAST search the default parameters were used (BLOSUM62 matrix, Word size: 3, Expect threshold: 100, Gap costs: Existence: 11, Extension: 1). However, low- sequence similarity and poor e-values of the PDB PSI-BLAST outputs rendered no direct choice of structures that can be used for homology modeling. The small length and conserved folding patterns of WW domains often enables us to produce stereo- chemically t structure even with templates of low similarity. So we have used the modbase [16] server (slow mode) for homology modeling of At F4JC80 WW domains. Modbase while generating the homology models identi es the best template for homology modeling. Modbase generates models using ModPipe, which is an automated modeling pipeline. ModPipe uses Modeler for fold assignment, sequence structure alignment, model building, and model assessment. The valida- tions of the structures obtained as outputs from Modbase were performed using the SAVES (v3) server with Procheck, Verify_3D, and Errat analysis [17 19] as well as through the ProSA [20] tool. Model visualization, inspection, analysis, and gure preparation were performed using Discovery Studio Client 3.5 [Accelrys, United States, presently BIOVIA, Dassault systems, France]. Built models were further subjected to energy minimizations. The energy minimization processes were run with conjugate gradient algorithm for 4,000 steps by applying the CHARMm [22] force eld until the structures reached the nal derivative of 0.01 kcal/mole using the Discovery Studio 2.5 package [Biovia]. Functional annotations of the At F4JC80 WW domains were performed by structurally comparing the models with structures of known function through the 28 A. Das et al. DALI server [21]. Only the outputs with a RMSD of <1.5 were used to assign functions to our domains of interest. The central groove created by the three sheets form the PRL/PRP binding region of any known WW domain [1] and till date all the known PRLs/PRPs of WW domains have been reported to be binding to this groove. In case of our docking studies, only those docked complexes where the PRL/PRP was found to be docked into this groove were considered for further analysis. Any other docking poses of ligand-receptor complex were rejected. We have extracted the 17 different PRL/PRP structures from different known complexes of proteins with WW domains as receptors bound to different ligand molecules or polypeptides which are available at the Protein Data Bank (http:// www.rcsb.org). These ligand structures were further heated to 373 K and then cooled to 273 K to release the structural constraints, if any, that might be present in them due to crystallization conditions or other structural limitations from the reported structural studies. These heating and cooling procedures were performed using the Accelrys Discovery Studio 2.5 package (Accelrys, USA; presently BIOVIA, Dassault Systems, France). Required energy minimization for these ligand structures were performed in Discovery Studio 2.5 using the Conjugate Gradient algorithm. All the docking studies were performed through the Z-DOCK server [23] (for rigid docking). Only those docked complexes that were found to have least energy as well as stereo-chemically t, were selected for further re nement. These reliable best outputs of the Z-DOCK server were subjected to further re nement via the FlexPepDock server [24]. Since 10 different output models are generated by FlexPepDock, similar criteria as of selecting the Z-DOCK output were also applied to choose the output of the FlexPepDock server. Validations of the docked complexes were performed through SAVES server using previously mentioned analytical tools. Energy minimizations of the docked complexes were performed as mentioned above with backbone xation to ensure proper interactions of the docked complexes. After each minimization, the struc- tures of the complexes were checked through Verify_3D and Procheck to determine their stereo-chemical tness. 3 Results and Discussions 3.1 Sequence Analysis The sequence of At F4JC80 is 892 amino acids long. It harbors two WW domains (Fig. 1a). The N terminal WW domain is located between amino acids 186 and 213 whereas the other WW domain is located at extreme C termini of the protein (860 890 amino acids) (Fig. 1a). Both of these pfam identi ed WW domains were found to contain the two conserved Trp residues as well as two aromatic Tyr residues in the middle of each region and the conserved terminal proline residue Structural and Functional Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana 29 Fig. 1 Domain organization of At F4JC80 WW domains and structural properties of these WW domains (left panel for 1st WW domain and right panel for 2nd WW domain). a 892 amino acids long At F4JC80 harbors two WW domains (marked with green boxes with their amino acid positions marked on each side).

Das et al. (Fig. 1a). The level of con dence to identify these two regions as WW domains were very high (2.4e 07 for the 1st WW domain and 8.9e 06 for the 2nd WW domain of At F4JC80). Since protein domains are the most important region of any protein in terms of mediating its interaction with ligands, substrates, or other proteins; presence of only WW domain in At F4JC80 rendered these two WW domains as the sole functional motif of At F4JC80. So for further understanding of the functional properties of At F4JC80, these two WW domains were subjected to homology modeling. Another important feature of At F4JC80 is the presence of polyproline rich stretches in this protein. PRLs are known as the ligands for WW domains and based on the composition of PRLs/PRPs, WW domains are classi ed into ve classes [1]. The At F4JC80 contains four polyproline stretches among which three are four proline residues long (537 540aa, 546 549aa, and 568 571aa) while one is ve proline residues long (556 560aa). Presence of both ligand and receptor domain (i.e., polyproline stretches and WW domains, respectively) could have signi cant impact in determining the state of activation (through the intra-molecular interac- tions of these ligand and domain), oligomerization (through mediating inter- molecular interactions), or binding partners (through interaction with other WW domains or polyproline stretches of other proteins) of At F4JC80. 3.2 Homology Modeling: Modeled Structure Description 3.2.1 1st WW Domain The 1st WW domain of At F4JC80 was build using the structure having PDB ID 2L5F chain A as template. The stereo-chemically t model consists of three sheets which are connected by turns (Fig. 1b, left panel). The length of each of the three sheets is different from each other. The side view of the At F4JC80 1st WW domain model shows a deep concave groove (Fig. 1c, left panel) which represents the primary PRL/PRP binding region of any WW domain. Along with Ramachan- dran plot (via Procheck), Verify_3D, and Errat analysis (See Appendix for details of about model quality), ProSA analysis of the model also validated its structural and energy-related properties (Fig. 1d, left panel). Superimposition of the model with its template identi ed the regions of deviations (arrow heads in Fig. 1e, f, left panel) which resulted in a RMSD of 1.79 between the model and its template. This difference in RMSD may indicate slight difference from its template but it is mainly due to low sequence similarity with the template (Fig. 1g, left panel). However, this structurally validated model showed 80 % structural overlap with its template as well an overall Z-score of 2.27 which con rmed the good overall quality of the model which was also represented as a point in the plot (Fig. 1d, left panel) that is in a range solved by X-ray and NMR studies. Structural and Functional Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana 31 3.2.2 2nd WW Domain The 2nd WW domain of At F4JC80 (modeled with PDB ID: 2YSB chain A as template) is also made of three variable length sheets with a turn connecting sheet 2 and 3 (Fig. 1b, c, right panel). Unlike the model of the 1st WW domain, sheet 1 and 2 of the 2nd WW domain model is connected by a longer loop structure and compared to the 1st WW domain model, the PRL/PRP binding groove of the 2nd WW domain is shallower (Fig. 1c, right panel). However, this model was also found to be stereo- chemically t and the ProSA energy function analysis of the model rendered an overall Z-score of 0.54 which also falls in a range solved by X-ray and NMR techniques. Superimposition of this model structure (Fig. 1e g, right panel) with its template was found to be more accurate (96.67 % structural overlap to template) than the 1st WW domain model and this also re ected in the lower RMSD of 0.74 . Both the models of the 1st and 2nd WW domain of At F4JC80 were found to be structurally suitable and they represented the overall common architecture of WW domains. Even with similar architectures, WW domains are quite different in terms of their functions and PRL/PRP choices. We have used the two above-mentioned models to perform functional annotations to each of them. 3.3 Ligand Binding Properties and Functional Properties of Arabidopsis thaliana F4JC80 WW Domains WW domains bind to polyproline rich stretches and their classi cation is also based on their PRL/PRP preferences. To understand the functional properties of the At F4JC80 WW domains, we performed docking of the generated models with the different PRLs/PRPs that are available at PDB. Re nement of the docked structure removed the structural constrains of the ligands while increasing its docking parameters (Fig. 2). The deep ligand binding groove of the 1st WW domain model was found to negatively impact the docking of the At F4JC80 1st WW domain (Fig. 2a, b, Table 2) with different PRLs/PRPs. Especially it affected the formation of Hydrogen bonds (H-bonds) in the deepest region of the groove by imposing distance constrains and thus no H-bond was found in the middle region of the ligand that spans over the triple sheet structure. However, the 2nd WW domain was found to be more general in terms of its PRL/PRP choices (Table 2). Especially the shallow ligand binding groove (Fig. 2c, d) also contributed signi cantly toward interacting with PRLs/PRPs in the form of forming more hydrogen bonds in this region. Making the PRL/PRP structure exible via Flexpepdock [24], this server have put the PRL/PRP in proper pose where it can better interact with the receptor WW domain (Fig. 2e, f). DockingstudiesshowedthatboththeWWdomainsmainlyboundtothePRLs/PRPs of class I WW domains (comprising of WW domains from E3 ubiquitin ligases like NEDD4, ITCH, and YAP as mentioned earlier) [1]. Beyond this, the 2nd WW domain also showed preference toward PRLs/PRPs that primarily interacts with Class V WW domains (which are formed by WW domains of transcription factor like Prp40) [1]. 32 A.

We have used online docking server Z-DOCK to nd out the ligand binding ability of both the WW domains of At F4JC80 with 17 different ligand sequences extracted from already reported structures of different WW domain ligand complexes (taken from protein database: http://www.rcsb.org). The result clearly shows that the 1st WW domain of At F4JC80 can bind to only a handful of ligands while the 2nd WW domain binds to almost all the types of proline rich ligands that were taken into consideration in this study. Since WW domains bind to their ligands only through their well known ligand binding groove (detailed in text), the deep groove that we have found in case of the 1st WW domain of F4JC80 could well be the reason for the inability of this domain to bind to different ligands as such deep grooves imposes a distance constrain to form successful atomic interactions 34 A. Das et al. For better insight into the functional properties of the At F4JC80 WW domains, we have used the DALI server for functional assessment by structural comparison. The DALI output (only those outputs with a RMSD of <1.5 were considered) showed that both the At F4JC80 WW domains are structurally similar to the WW domains of NEDD4 family which also synergized with our ndings from the docking studies. Overall this study on the in silico characterization of At F4JC80 has identi ed the presence of two WW domains in this protein as well as assigned functional annotations two these domains by molecular docking techniques and structure- based functional assessment studies. Such computational studies which is a rst of its kind on plant WW domains would provide a future direction on further char- acterization of this or similar types of proteins. Future studies addressing these proteins from experimental approach will prove to be signi cant in understanding the overall interactome of these proteins. 4 Conclusions This study on structural and functional properties of At F4JC80 identi ed presence of two WW domains and four polyproline rich stretches in the protein. Both the models of the WW domain were found to contain the standard triple sheet structure but there were signi cant difference in the PRL/PRP binding groove of the WW domains. This difference caused better ability of the 2nd WW domain to bind to PRL/PRPs as the deep groove was found to have a negative impact on the 1st WW domain s PRL/PRP binding capabilities. However, docking and structural com- parison-based function annotation studies found both the WW domains belong to the Class I WW domains (speci cally related to NEDD4 and SMURF family). Based on the well-characterized roles of NEDD4 and SMURF E3 ubiquitin ligases [4], it can be hypothesized that the At F4JC80 WW domains are most probably involved with gene expression control by regulating protein turnover during TGF signaling. Also the presence of nuclear localization signal (regions 746-KRTKKK-751 795-KRKR- 798 826-WREKVKRKRERAEKSQKKDPE 846, identi ed through NLStradamus server [25]), makes this protein an important player in nuclear context. Moreover, the ability of the 2nd WW domain to bind to ligands of WW domains belonging to Prp40 (PDB ID: 2DYF) and ca150 (PDB ID: 2RM0) as well as with formin polyproline region (PDB ID: 2VDF) shows a wider arena of functional interactions of At F4JC80 in cellular context where it has the possibility to directly regulate cellular actin cytoskeleton [26] and gene transcription.

As a result of stress, most genes are deactivated, while a few are activated with antistress response. The latter involves a variety of molecules including molecular chaperones or heat shock proteins (Shps) whose levels get increased in stressed conditions, particularly at elevated temper- atures. Heat shock proteins help the other cellular proteins to achieve their native states, i.e. correct folding or functional conformations. Thus, heat shock proteins play a major role in protein homeostasis network of the cell. Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) are one of the families of molecular chaperones that prevent the irreversible aggregation and assist in the refolding of denatured proteins. Two members of the sHsp family, IbpA and IbpB, are present in Escherichia coli. The IbpA and IbpB proteins are 48 % identical at the amino acid sequence level and have the characteristic -crystalline domain. It is known that the cooperation between IbpA and IbpB is crucial for their chaperone activity in heat stressed condition. So far, the molecular mechanisms of the stress response of the IbpA/ IbpB protein system have not been well understood. In the present work, an attempt has been made to identify the amino acid residues of the IbpA and IbpB proteins, which are found to be involved in protein protein interactions. The interactions between IbpA and IbpB are studied with and without the presence of substrate Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) at cold shock, physiological and heat shock tem- peratures to observe the changes in the pattern of interaction. This study is the rst report to elucidate the mechanism of interactions between the proteins. Keywords Small heat shock proteins  Heat stress  Heat shock temperature  Ibpa IbpB interaction S.

Cell stresses are frequent and recurring which challenge the cells leading ultimately to stress response. Most of the genes are deactivated as a result of cellular stress response, but only a few become activated to combat it. The antistress response mechanism involves a variety of molecules including molecular chaper- ones and proteases or heat shock proteins (Shps) whose levels increase particularly at elevated temperatures [1]. Heat Shps help the other cellular proteins to achieve the native folding conformations, to localize them at their destined sub-cellular organelles, to prevent their denaturation by heat stresses and retrieve native folding states after partial denaturations. Thus, heat Shps play a vital role in cellular protein homeostasis network [2]. Small heat shock proteins (sHsps) belong to the families of molecular chaper- ones that assist in the refolding of denatured proteins by resisting the irreversible aggregation [3]. Small heat Shps are wide in distribution. They are characterized by their low molecular weight (12 30 kDa) and the presence of a conserved -crys- talline domain [4]. Their robust upregulation under temperature-stressed conditions make them among the most abundant cellular proteins [5]. Two members of sHsp family, IbpA and IbpB are found in Escherichia coli. These two proteins are 48 % identical at amino acid sequence level [6] and have the characteristic -crystalline domain anked by N- and C-terminal ends [7]. Initially, both are identi ed as inclusion body proteins but later they are found in protein aggregates in temperature-stressed cells [8]. The ef ciency of IbpA/IbpB depends on increased temperature with protein reactivation and protection from degradation found at elevated temperatures [9]. It is reported that the presence of IbpA during heat denaturation of substrate is suf cient to assist to change the macroscopic properties of aggregates, yet this alone does not increase the ef ciency of the subsequent reactivation of such aggregated polypeptides. The presence of IbpB is required to assist to increase the ef ciency of disaggregation and refolding [10]. This observation depicts the cooperative mode of interaction of IbpA and IbpB, in which IbpA associates rst with the aggregating protein or substrate and then attracts IbpB to the complex [11]. So the cooperation between IbpA and IbpB is crucial for their chaperone activity in temperature-stressed condition. So far, the molecular mechanisms of the stress response of the IbpA/IbpB protein system have not been well understood. In the present work, we tried to elucidate the interaction pro les between the proteins at the molecular level. We identi ed the amino acid residues of the IbpA and IbpB proteins which are found to be involved in protein protein interactions. The interactions between IbpA and IbpB are studied with and without the presence of substrate Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) [12] at cold shock, physiological and heat shock temperatures to observe the changes in the pattern of interaction following heat and cold stress. This study is the rst report to elucidate the mechanism of interactions between the proteins. 42 S. Bhattacharjee et al. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Sequence Homology Search First, the amino acid sequences of IbpA and IbpB, comprising of 137 and 142 amino acid residues, respectively, were extracted from UniProt [13] (id:P0C054 and id:P0C058, respectively). This was then used as input sequence to search for the template in PDB [14] using PSI-BLAST [15]. In both the cases, the A chain of crystal structure of an eukaryotic small heat shock protein (PDB code:1GME) [16] was obtained as the closest match. 2.2 Homology Modelling of the Proteins This structure (1GME, chain A) was then used as a template to build the homology models for IbpA and IbpB separately in Accelrys Discovery Studio Modeller (version 2.5) [17]. Alternatively, the models of IbpA and IbpB were also built independently using RaptorX [18] and Phyre2 [19] homology modelling servers. The models so generated were energy minimized to ensure proper interactions applying CHARMM force eld [20] using conjugate gradient algorithm [21] until the structures reached the nal derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol. The stereochemical qualities of the resultant structures were then checked with PROCHECK [22] and Verify3D [23] and Ramachandran plots [24] were drawn. No residues were found to be present in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. 2.3 Molecular Docking Simulations with IbpA and IbpB The model of IbpA was docked with the model of IbpB using Zdock [25], PyDock [26], Patchdock [27], GrammX [28] and Cluspro [29] servers in order to get a comprehensive result. Docked complexes with best score were selected and the stereochemical qualities of the models were checked with PROCHECK and Ver- ify3D. The docked complex with the best PROCHECK and Verify3D score was selected as the nal working model. The nal docked complex was then energy minimized to ensure proper interactions. 918 cycles of steepest descent (SD) energy minimization [30] were performed in explicit solvent system [31] applying CHARMM force eld in GROMACS version 4.6.5 [32] until the structure reached the nal derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol. The stereochemical qualities of minimized docked complex were again tested with PROCHECK and Verify3D. Structural Insights into IbpA IbpB Interactions 43 Next, the crystal structure of the substrate, i.e. LDH was retrieved from PDB (PDB code-3H3F) [33] and the stereochemical qualities were tested with PRO- CHECK and Verify3D. Then, this structure was again docked with docked complex of IbpAB using Zdock, PyDock, Patchdock, GrammX and Cluspro. The stereo- chemical qualities of the docked complexes so generated were tested with PRO- CHECK and Verify3D. Docked complex with the best score was selected as the nal working model and was then energy minimized to ensure proper interactions using SD algorithm in explicit solvent system applying CHARMM force eld in GROMACS version 4.6.5 until the structure reached the nal derivative of 0.001 kcal/mol. The docked complex was minimized in 875 steps using SD algorithm. 2.4 Molecular Dynamics Simulation of the Complexes In order to study the stress response both the minimized docked complexes (i.e. IbpA IbpB and IbpAB-LDH) were then elevated from cold shock temperature (300 K) to physiological (310 K) and heat shock temperature (318 K) [34] sepa- rately and 20 ns of production runs were performed in GROMACS version 4.6.5 in each of the cases, keeping pressure constant. The conformational changes were recorded and plotted against time. Further analyses were done using Discovery Studio Package version 2.5. 3 Results Analyses of docked complexes have revealed that, irrespective of the presence or absence of substrate, IbpA and IbpB have followed a de nite pattern of interactions following cold shock and heat shock temperature in contrast to physiological temperature. It has been observed that, in case of IbpA IbpB docked complex, 12 amino acid residues are involved in forming H-bond interactions in cold shock temperature (300 K) (Fig. 1). The interactions go down at the physiological tem- perature of (310 K) which involve only 10 amino acid residues (Fig. 2). However, with rise in temperature from 300 to 310 K the previous 12 amino acid residues which were involved in H-bond interactions in cold shock temperature are restored when the docked complex is elevated to heat shock temperature (318 K) (Fig. 3) (Table 1). In presence of the substrate LDH, it has been observed that the IbpAB-LDH docked complex has 18 amino acid residues forming H-bond interactions in cold shock temperature, among which 8 amino acid residues from IbpA/B interact with the substrate LDH and the remaining 10 residues show inter-protein H-bond 44 S. Bhattacharjee et al. interactions (Fig. 4). When this docked complex (IbpAB with substrate LDH) is brought to physiological temperature, only 15 amino acid residues are involved in H-bond interactions. Of these 15 amino acid residues, 6 residues interact with LDH and the rest of them show inter-protein interactions (Fig. 5). When the complex again is elevated to heat shock temperature, the docked complex restores the interaction pattern as it shows 18 amino acid residues participating in H-bond interactions, among which 8 amino acid residues interact with the substrate LDH and the remaining 10 amino acid residues have inter-protein interactions (Fig. 6) (Table 2).

Bhattacharjee et al. 4 Discussions Escherichia coli small heat Shps, IbpA and IbpB, function as molecular chaperones and protect misfolded proteins against irreversible aggregation as well as help the unfolded proteins to restore their native conformations following heat stress. In our study, it is observed that irrespective of presence or absence of substrate LDH, the number of interactions increases both in heat shock and cold shock tem- peraturesincomparisontophysiologicaltemperature.InpresenceofsubstrateLDH,at cold shock temperature (300 K) 8 amino acid residues of IbpA and IbpB interact with substrate LDH and 10 residues show inter-protein interactions.

H-bonds are marked in green dashed lines] (the relevant interacting residues that are unique to this conformation are shown) Structural Insights into IbpA IbpB Interactions 47 residues, IbpA is involved in seven interactions, whereas the remaining one is contributed by IbpB. At physiological temperature (310 K), only two amino acid residues of IbpB interact with the substrate, whereas four amino acid residues of IbpA interact with the same and only 9 residues show inter-protein interactions. When the complexis brought to heat shock temperature (318 K),8 amino acid residues of IbpAB interact with substrate LDH, of which ve residues are contributed by IbpA and remaining three residues by IbpB, whereas at heat shock temperature, another 10 residues are involved in inter-protein interactions. In each of the cases, the number of interactingresidues ismore in IbpA than IbpB, which suggests that IbpA interacts with the substrate rst, thus allowing it to be more exposed to interact with IbpB to make ef cient refolding of heat stressed substrate. It is also noted that inter-protein inter- action increases at cold shock and heat shock temperature in comparison to physio- logical temperature, which indicates that in heat stressed condition, the cooperative interaction between IbpA and IbpB is also important for their chaperone activity. So far, this is the rst study to elucidate the molecular mechanism of the binding inter- actions of IbpA and IbpB at heat stress conditions. This work would therefore be essential to predict the hitherto unknown molecular mechanisms of IbpAB interactions.

Santhosh Kumar and A. Anand Kumar Abstract Multi-parameter patient monitor (MPM) keep track of the condition of a patient in intensive care units (ICU) or general wards using the human vital parameters, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2). A high accuracy for the overall classi cation, speci city and sensitivity is extremely important in providing quality health care to the patients. Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised algorithm that is effectively used in MPMs for classi cation. A careful study of the vital parameters in a healthy person reveals that there exists an intrinsic relationship between the four vital parameters, for example when heart rate is on the higher side, blood pressure is expected to be on the lower side and vice versa. Hence, it would be highly required to understand the correlation between the vital parameters and to integrate it into the MPM system. In this work, we present the results of the MPM using the SVM as back-end classi er. Further, we use correlation features (feature expansion) along with base parameters in an effort to improve the performance of MPM and note that the performance of the MPM enhanced signi cantly.

Studies of vital parameters to show evidence of physiological deteri- oration even before the patient s abnormal condition, which leads to improvement in mortality rates [1]. The current early warning score (EWS) [2] systems assign scores to each vital sign based on clinical experience, depending on its diversion away from some assumed normal range. If the scores for a vital parameters, exceeds threshold, then a clinical analysis of the patient is prompted. There is a substantial error rate associated with manual scoring and they do not consider the intrinsic relationship between the vital parameters that exist in healthy people [3 6]. Machine learning techniques can be applied to detect physiological deterioration in patients health, with high accuracy as compared to the EWS system [7]. MPM uses support vector machine (SVM) classi cation, found to be effective in providing state-of-the-art performance [8, 9]. The vital parameter data gathered from the bedside monitors can be utilized to train an MPM system that could be used to effectively predict the condition of a patient under observation. One class SVMs [10] using the prior intelligence gathered from some assumed normal behaviour was found to be effective in the development of MPMs. However, when suf cient samples from the abnormal condition is available, it was seen that the two class SVMs [11] outperform one class SVMs. Studies on the vital parameters in a healthy person suggests that there exists a well-established intrinsic relationship [3 5] between the four vital parameters, for example, when heart rate tend to increase, blood pressure is expected to get lower and vice versa. In this work, we capture the correlation between human vital parameters, to capture the intrinsic relationship between the parameters for diagnosis more accurately and also achieve higher sensitivity, speci city and overall classi cation accuracy. We experimented with SVM algorithm [8] using linear, non-linear and homogeneous kernels for constructing a model to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and to enhance the operation of the MPMs. The system developed in the present work uses MIMIC-II database to determine the develop- ments in the vital parameters. 2 Database Used for the Experiments Experiments were performed on the vital parameters, obtained from MIMIC-II database [12, 13]. MIMIC-II consists of two major parts, namely clinical data and physiological waveforms. From bedside patient monitors (Component Monitoring System Intellivue MP-70; Philips Healthcare), the physiological waveforms are collected, used in medical, surgical, coronal care and neonatal ICUs in a tertiary hospital. The waveform database includes high resolution (125 Hz) waveforms (e.g., ECG), derived numeric time series such as heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and oxygen saturation [12]. The database also consists of monitor generated alarms along with the physician annotated les. 54 S. Premanand et al. 3 Support Vector Machine Support Vector Machine [8] is a set of supervised learning methods used for classi cation and regression [14], given by a set of data with associated labels. SVM constructs a hyperplane that separates two classes, and the separating hyper- plane is chosen to maximize the margin between the examples of two classes. Breaking up the classes with a big margin, minimizes a bound on expected generalization error (chance of predicting error during classi cation). On the bounding planes, the points in the data set which are falling are called support vectors, sv. If the given data points are non-linear kernel, k(x, y), where x and y are the points in the dataset with labels naming, lx and ly, with lx, ly 1. Classi cation of the test vector x is de ned by, lx sign X M i 1 aik x; sv i ! 1 where sv(i) means ith support vector, M is the number of support vectors and a be the dual representation of separating hyperplane s normal vector. In this work, we experiment with basic kernels, linear, polynomial and RBF kernels and the additive kernels [15] like intersection [16, 17], Chi-square [15] and JS kernels [18], in the SVM backend used in the MPM system. 1.

Additional information about the balance/imbalance of the patients health status are there in the expanded feature set, for example, the relationship between the Improving the Performance of Multi-parameter Patient Monitor 55 parameters exposes the risk factor for problems like cardiovascular abnormalities, hyperoxia (high oxygen content in the blood), hypoxia (low oxygen content in the blood), etc. The baseline system features [6] set is given by, F x1; x2; x3; x4; x1x2; p x1x3; p x1x4; p x2x3; p x2x4; p x3x4 p  2 In this work, we gathered more additional information by increasing the feature set to G, to make the performance of MPM improved, and the feature set G is given by, G x1; x2; x3; x4; x1x2; p x1x3; p x1x4; p x2x3; p x2x4; p x3x4 p ; h x1x2 x1 x2 ; x1x3 x1 x3 ; x1x4 x1 x4 ; x2x3 x2 x3 ; x2x4 x2 x4 ; x3x4 x3 x4  3 where x1, x2, x3 and x4 are the human vital parameters, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and oxygen saturation (SpO2) values, respectively, and the remaining correlation features helps to capture the intrinsic relationship between the vital parameters along with the help of explicit feature maps for addictive kernels such as intersection, Chi square and JS kernels. 5 Experimental Results The MIMIC-II database consists of four vital parameters collected from 413 patients. Among them, data from 12 patients were not suitable, and the remaining 401 patients data are used for the experiment. From the 401 patients, 1454,010 samples are separated as, 1100,510 (300 patients) samples as training data and 311,423 (101 patients) samples as testing data. Afterwards, the integral training and testing data are shuf ed randomly as 50,000 and 20,000 samples with the corre- sponding labels. The process is repeated to generate samples for seven independent trials, and the results obtained from these trails are averaged to obtain the nal result. We used LIBSVM for all our experiments. Table 1 illustrates the perfor- mance of SVM MPM system by using four vital parameters, Table 2 illustrates the performance of SVM MPM system by using four vital parameters with additional six correlation features by using geometric mean calculation thereby, increasing the ef ciency and Table 3 explains the expansion of six features with the previous process by the proportion of geometric mean to the arithmetic mean calculation, hence we achieve better ef ciency than by 10-feature parameter. Results conclude that the use of correlation features (16 features) along with the four vital parameters helped to enhance the MPM system performance when compared to the baseline system with ten features. 56 S. Premanand et al. 6 Conclusion We notice that the values of the four vital parameters heart rate, blood pressure, respiration rate and oxygen saturation are always positive quantities, and thus the correlation features derived from these four vital parameters. In this report, we proposed a novel approach to improve the process of the MPMs taking advantage of the intrinsic relationship between the vital parameters, using additional six features by a proportion of geometric mean to the arithmetic mean calculation of the vital parameters required in a pair of two, making the total number of features in the proposed system as 16. In our experiments with the feature expansion for MPM, we are able to make an improvement in the proposed system. We measured the baseline system and the proposed system using sensitivity, speci city and overall classi cation accuracy.

Rough Set Rule-Based Technique for the Retrieval of Missing Data in Malaria Diseases Diagnosis B.S. Panda, S.S. Gantayat and Ashok Misra Abstract Malaria disease is a major tropical public health problem in the world. The diagnosis of this type of tropical diseases involves several levels of uncertainty and imprecision. It causes severe infection to the brain and prevents brain from its proper functioning. Hence prior detection of the malaria is much essential. Soft Computing Techniques provide excellent methodologies to process the medical data and help medical experts in nding out the nature of illness and to take decision. True data set collection, feature squeezing, and classi cation are the basic steps followed in designing an expert system. The designed expert system acts with intelligence, prevents erroneous decisions, and produces sharp results in time. This paper discusses on malaria investigation with missing data using rough set rule- based soft computing technique. Keywords Accuracy  Malaria  Missing data  Medical diagnosis  Rough set  Rule set 1 Introduction In India, malaria constitutes a great threat to the health of many communities. The harmful effects of malaria parasites to the human body cannot be under estimated. Malaria is a parasitic disease caused mainly by species of Anopheles mosquitoes. The B.S.

Gunjan (eds.), Computational Intelligence in Medical Informatics, Forensic and Medical Bioinformatics, DOI 10.1007/978-981-287-260-9_6 59 emergence of information technology (IT) has opened unprecedented opportunities in health care delivery system as the demand for intelligent and knowledge-based systems has increased as modern medical practices become more knowledge- intensive. The diagnosis of tropical diseases involves several levels of uncertainty and imprecision [1]. The task of disease diagnosis and management is complex because of the numerous variables involved in data sets, which may contain a lot of imprecision and uncertainties. Patients cannot describe exactly how they feel, doctors and nurses cannot tell exactly what they observe, and laboratories results are dotted with some errors caused either by the carelessness of technicians or by malfunctioning of the instrument. Medical researchers cannot precisely characterize how diseases alter the normal functioning of the body [2, 3]. All these complexities in medical practice make traditional quantitative approaches of analysis inappropriate. Computer tools help to organize, store, and retrieve missing appropriate medical knowledge needed by the practitioner in dealing with each dif cult case and suggesting appropriate diagnosis and decision-making technique. In this article, we provided a rule-based soft computing technique for the diagnosis of malaria to nd the appropriate (missing) symptoms to diagnosis the malaria. This technique is based on clinical observations, medical diagnosis, and the expert s knowledge. The objective of the system is to provide a decision support platform to medical researchers, physicians, and other healthcare practitioners in malaria endemic regions. In addition, the system will assist medical personnel in the tedious and complication task of diagnosing and further provide a scheme that will assist medical personnel especially in rural areas, where there are shortages of doctors, thereby, and offering primary health care to the people. 2 Literature Review Missing data are questions without answers or variables without observation. Even a small percentage of missing data can cause serious problems with the analysis leading to draw wrong conclusions and imperfect knowledge. There are many techniques developed in the literature to manipulate the knowledge with uncertainty and manage data with incomplete items, but no results, and the results are not of the same type and absolutely better than the others [4 6]. To handle such problems, researchers are trying to solve it in different approaches and then proposed to handle the information system in their way. We know that the attribute values are important for information processing in a data set or information table. In the eld of databases, various efforts have been made for the improvement and enhance of database or information table query process to retrieve the data. The methodology followed by different approaches such as fuzzy sets [7, 8], rough sets [9, 10], Boolean logic, possibility theory, statistically similarity [11], etc. 60 B.S. Panda et al. 3 Rough Sets 3.1 De nition and Notations The concept of rough set is another approach to deal with imperfect knowledge. It was introduced by Pawlak in 1982 [10]. From a philosophical point of view, rough set theory is a new approach to deal vagueness and uncertainty, and from a practical point of view, it is a new method of data analysis. This method has the following important advantages: It provides ef cient algorithms for nding hidden patterns in data; It nds reduced set of data (data reduction); It evaluates signi cance of data; It generates minimal set of decision rules from data; It is easy to understand; It offers straightforward interpretation of results; It can be used in both qualitative and quantitative data analyses; and It identi es relationship that would not be found by using statistical methods. Let R UxU denote an equivalence relation on U, that is, R is a re exive, symmetric, and transitive relation. The equivalence class of an element x U with respect to R is the set of elements y U such that xRy. If two elements x, y in U belong to the same equivalence class then we say that x and y are indistin- guishable with respect to relation R. Given an arbitrary set A U, it may not be possible to describe A precisely in the approximation space apr(R) = (U, R) instead one may only characterize A by a pair of lower and upper approximations. This leads to the concept of rough sets (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Rough set approach Rough Set Rule-Based Technique 61 We de ne, RA [ Y 2 U=R : Y  A f g; and RA [ Y 2 U=R : Y \A 6 u f g: RA and RA are respectively called the R-lower and R-upper approximation of A with respect to R. It can be noted that RA x 2 U : xR   A f g and RA x 2 U : x R\X 6 u   : The set BNR A RARA is called the R-boundary of A. The set RA consists of all those elements of U which can with certainty be classi ed as elements of A, employing the knowledge R. The set RA consists of all those elements of U which can possibly be classi ed as elements of A, employing the knowledge R. Set BNR(A) is the set of elements which cannot be classi ed as either belonging to A or belonging to A having the knowledge R. We say that a set A is R-de nable if and only if RA RA. Otherwise A is said to be R-rough. The borderline region is the undecidable area of the universe. We say that X is rough with respect to R if and only if RX 6 RX, equivalently BNR X 6 /. X is said to be R-de nable if and only if RX RX, or BNR X /. 3.2 Application of Rough Set We brie y highlight few applications of Rough set theory [12].

However, many real-life data sets are incomplete. The missing attribute value is denoted by ? . From the above, the different classes can be generated using rough set concept as follows. Temperature = {C01, C06, C07, C10, C13, C15}, {C02, C05, C08, C09, C12}, {C03, C14}, {C04}, {C11}} Headache = {{C01, C02, C04, C05, C07, C09, C10, C15}, {C03, C06, C13}, {C08}, {C11, C12, C14}} Nausea = {{C01, C02, C03, C05, C15}, {C04, C08}, {C06, C07, C09, C10, C12, C13, C14}, {C11}} Vomiting = {{C01, C03, C04, C06}, {C02}, {C05, C07, C08, C09, C10, C13, C15}, {C11, C12, C14}} Joint_Pain = {{C01, C03, C15}, {C02, C05, C08, C09, 12}, {C04, C07, C11, C14},{C06, C10,C13}} Body_Weakness = {{C01, C05}, {C02, C08, C09, C13}, {C03, C04, C07, C12, C14, C15}, {C06, C10},{C11}} Malaria = {{C01, C05, C06, C10, C13, C15}, {C02, C03, C04, C07, C08, C09, C11, C12, C14}} In the above classi cation, the bold classes are the missing data, which will be lled in the currently proposed technique. Here, the rules are in the following two classes for Malaria types Yes or No . If the symptoms lie in any of the temperature, head ache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body weakness, then the Malaria type is either Yes or No . 5 Proposed System The proposed system for malaria diagnosis uses rough set rule-based system. The steps included in the proposed system are given below in Fig. 2. Algorithm: Step 1: Malaria Data Set Collect the Malaria data set which includes relevant objects and attributes. Setp 2: Divide Data Set Divide the malaria set into training and testing sets using split factor of 60 and 40 %. Step 3: Cut Set Form cut set for the training set which represents the nonoverlapping subsets thus divides the attributes into set of intervals. Cuts act as a boundary values representing those intervals.

Step 4: Rule Set Rules are formed from the attribute by common attribute values through logical AND. It also states the result class to which a particular rule point to. Step 5: Substitute Common Attribute One of the simplest methods to handle missing attribute values, such values are replaced by the most common value of the attribute. In different words, a missing attribute value is replaced by the most probable known attribute value, where such probabilities are represented by relative frequencies of corresponding attribute values. Note: The rules generated here can be extended with the logical operators OR and NOT for a large dataset. 6 Cut Set for Overlapping Data Cut set de nes the mechanism of decomposing attribute value set in a dataset or information table. The attributes are discretized to generate a set of intervals. These are edge points to highlight the intervals. In case of representative attributes, cuts stand for the nonoverlapping subsets of actual values. Table 2 represents cut set consists of attributes for which the cuts are created. Size represents the quantity of cuts created. In the following table, the missing attributes are represented by ? .

Cut set states the result attribute in terms of other attributes, which is a feature reduction based on Boolean logics of algebra. 7 Rough Set Rule-Based Technique The rough set rule-based technique usually have several antecedents that are combined using logical operators, such as AND, OR, and NOT, though their de nitions tend to vary. In the rules, AND simply uses minimum weight of all the antecedents, while OR uses the maximum value, the IF part is called the antecedent, and the THEN part is called the consequent [13, 14]. The conditions are the set of attributes such as temperature, head ache, nausea, vomiting, joint pain, body weakness, etc. There are different approaches to generate rules, direct and indirect methods. Direct methods generate rule from training data like sequential covering algorithms. Indirect methods build the classi cation model from which rule are extracted, e.g., decision tree, neural network, genetic algorithms, etc. The rule can be assessed by its coverage and accuracy. Coverage, if all the antecedents in a rule R hold true for a given D. Accuracy, is the number of tables that are correctly classi ed in the coverage. The coverage and accuracy are deter- mined by the following formula. Coverage R ncovers D j j Accuracy R ncorrect ncovers Information gain is a supervised feature selection method. It is a method that measures the decrease in entropy when the feature is given rather than not given. It can generalize to any number of classes. The entropy of a discrete random variable X with a probability distribution p(x) is de ned as H p X x2X p x log p x These formulas are determined by aid of both the expert doctors in the eld of tropical medicine and literature. Some of the rules (Rules 1, Rules 2, Rules 5, Rule 8, Rule 15) can be interpreted as follows: Rule 1: IF temperature = mild and headache = mild and nausea = mild and vomiting = mild and joint pain = mild and body weakness = ? THEN malaria = No. Rule 2: IF temperature = moderate and headache = mild and nausea = mild and vomiting = ? and joint pain = moderate and body weakness = mod- erate THEN malaria = Yes. Rule 3: IF temperature = severe and headache = moderate and nausea = mild and vomiting = mild and joint pain = mild and body weakness = severe THEN malaria = Yes. Rough Set Rule-Based Technique 67 Rule 5: IF temperature = moderate and headache = mild and nausea = mild and vomiting = moderate and joint pain = moderate and body weakness = ? THEN malaria = No. Rule 8: IF temperature = moderate and headache = ? and nausea = ? and vomiting = moderate and joint pain = moderate and body weak- ness = moderate THEN malaria = Yes. Rule 15: IF temperature = mild and headache = mild and nausea = mild and vomiting = moderate and joint pain = mild and body weakness = severe THEN malaria = Yes. The notion of rough set [15 17] is used to classify the patients with malaria or not and also the other attributes which gives a group of similar information in the data set. Here the other rules are not mentioned to avoid the complexity and confusion with the given rules. 8 Results and Discussion To implement the concept of rough set rule-based technique to simplifying the diagnosis of malaria and impute the missing attributes, we have considered 15 data sets with six attributes out of 20 real data sets with ten attributes collected from different doctors. The technique used on knowledge of domain experts ( ve medical doctors), applied with rough set theory. Rough set classi cation is utilized to remove uncertainty, ambiguity, and vagueness inherent in medical diagnosis. The bold attributes in the above table show the unmatched attribute with the actual attributes, to measure the accuracy using the formula we found 70 % of accuracy, i.e., out of 10 cases 7 cases are matched. After imputation of common attribute using rough set rule-based technique, the following tables 3 and 4 shows the results.

After replacing proper values to the missing data, we get the different classes from the above table as follows. Temperature = {C01, C06, C07, C10, C13, C15}, {C02, C05, C08, C09, C12}, {C03, C11, C14}, {C04}} Headache = {{C01, C02, C04, C05, C07, C09, C10, C15}, {C03, C06, C08, C13}, {C11, C12, C14}} Nausea = {{C01, C02, C03, C05, C15}, {C06, C07, C08, C09, C10, C12, C13, C14}, {C04, C11}} Vomiting = {{C01, C03, C04, C06}, {C02, C05, C07, C08, C09, C10, C13, C15}, {C11, C12, C14}} Joint_Pain = {{C01, C03, C06, C10, C15}, {C02, C05, C08, C09, C12, C13}, {C04, C07, C11, C14}} Body_Weakness = {{C02, C05, C08, C09, C13}, {C03, C04, C07, C12, C14, C15}, {C01, C06, C10}, {C11}} Malaria = {{C01, C05, C06, C10, C13, C15}, {C02, C03, C04, C07, C08, C09, C11, C12, C14}} After the imputation, the different classes for individual attributes are reassigned with the currently added new data. From the above table, it is clear that the classes generated for the decision making are reducing after imputing the missing values by using the rule generation method (Table 5). The analysis of the classi cation shows the following result. Table 5 Comparison of before and after imputing missing values Symptom types No. of classes before imputing missing values (A) No. of classes after imputing missing val- ues (B) No. of changes in classes |(A-B)| Temperature 5 4 1 Headache 4 3 1 Nausea 4 3 1 Vomiting 4 3 1 Joint_Pain 4 3 1 Body_Weakness 5 4 1 70 B.S. Panda et al. 9 Conclusion Malaria investigation using rough set rule-based soft computing technique shows good imputation and coverage. It has handled 15 cases and 6 attributes. The above method handles attributes even in the presence of absent values. In future, the same method can be used to investigate other diseases by replacing the absent values with common attribute value. This approach can be combined with other classi ers to enhance further to retrieve the missing data in a data set or information table. This technique can be enhanced by using rough logic, which is a future direction. References 1.

Surya Prasath and Radhakrishnan Delhibabu Abstract Video capsule endoscopy (VCE) has proven to be a pain-free imaging technique of gastrointestinal (GI) tract and provides continuous stream of color imagery. Due to the amount of images captured automatic computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) methods are required to reduce the burden of gastroenterologists. In this work, we propose a fast and ef cient method for obtaining segmentations of VCE images automatically without manual supervision. We utilize an ef cient active contour without edges model which accounts for topological changes of the mucosal surface when the capsule moves through the GT tract. Comparison with related image segmentation methods indicate we obtain better results in terms of agreement with expert ground-truth boundary markings. Keywords Capsule endoscopy  Image segmentation  Active contours  CAD 1 Introduction Oesophagel cancer rate in India is one of the highest in the world. Although low and stable incidence and mortality rates from colorectal cancers were observed in India [1], these rates were associated with a low 5-year relative survival rate [2]. This low survival rate suggests severe de ciencies in early diagnosis and effective treatment in India. Since as noted in [2] population-based screening of colorectal V.B.

Gunjan (eds.), Computational Intelligence in Medical Informatics, Forensic and Medical Bioinformatics, DOI 10.1007/978-981-287-260-9_7 73 cancer is not cost-effective, given the low burden of colorectal cancer, early diagnosis and adequate treatment using imaging techniques are important. VCE introduced at the turn of this millennium [3] paved the way for painless non-invasive way to image the gastrointestinal tract, see Fig. 1. A wireless capsule consist of a tiny imaging device provides continuous video stream of the inner mucosa-lumen tubular structure. Typically, these VCE exam for each patient consist of 8 h of video which is around 55,000 frames. This puts an enormous burden on the gastroenterologists since examining and reviewing the video from capsule endoscopy requires concentration for a long durations. Thus, automatic CAD methods are required which can help in analysis and diagnosis [4 6], see [7] for a recent review. Computerized video analysis algorithms can reduce the time required to review VCE exams and can augment the decision making processes. Lumen detection in other imaging modalities have been studied by some researchers. In [8, 9] colonoscopy images are considered and adaptive thresholding type techniques were utilized. The wireless capsule optical system usually consist of ashing LEDs, as opposed to xed lighting in colonoscopy, and an imaging sensor which captures the images at prede ned time intervals. Thus, thresholding type methods may not capture strong intensity variations between frames. In this work, we study an automatic image segmentation method for VCE imagery to segment lumen boundaries without any manual supervision. For this purpose we start with the well-known image segmentation method based on active contours without edges [10]. This method involves level sets which are known to handle topological changes and thus is suitable for mucosa deformations which occur in VCE data [11]. Though ef cient, the traditional implementation was not fast for real-time imaging and is restricted to takes 0.32 s/frame (of size 512 512). To speed up the active contour segmentation further, in this paper we propose a fast and ef cient implementation of the active contour model which obtains good segmentations. Compared with some of the classical and contemporary image Fig. 1 Wireless capsule endoscopy: a The patient swallows the capsule and capsule travels through the tubular intestinal path.

Surya Prasath and R. Delhibabu segmentation techniques we obtain better segmentations when benchmarked with marked ground-truth boundaries. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives the proposed fast active contour based segmentation method. Section 3 provides experimental results on various VCE images supporting our proposed approach. Finally, Sect. 4 concludes the paper. 2 Active Contours for Lumen-Mucosa Separation 2.1 Active Contour Without Edges Chan and Vese [10] studied the active contour without edges (ACWE) method which gives better segmentation results than other active contour based schemes. ACWE is a modi ed version of the Mumford-Shah functional [12] and is an alternating minimization scheme. Implementation of the nonlinear minimization scheme is undertaken using the level sets methodology [13]. Suppose that the input image u : X  R2 ! R where represents the image domain, usually a rectangle. Then the piecewise constant ACWE is given by min /;c1;c2 e /; c1; c2 l Z X d / jr/jdx k Z X ju  c1j2H / dx k Z X ju  c2j2 1  H / dx 1 where > 0 and 0 are given xed parameters, c1, c2 represent regions inside and outside the level set function respectively. The function H(z) := 1 if z 0, H(z) : = 0 if z < 0 is the Heaviside function, and d z : d dz H z is the Dirac delta function in the sense distributions. In [10], the Euler-Lagrange equation of the functional (1), which is a necessary condition for a minimizer triplet ( , c1, c2) to satisfy, is implemented. That is, the following nonlinear PDE is solved for and c1, c2: o/ ot de / ldiv r/ r/ j j    k1 u  c1 k2 u  c2   2 with c1 R X uHe / dx R X uHe / dx ; c2 R X u 1  He / dx R X u 1  He / dx 3 Here, de; He represent the regularized versions of the dirac delta and Heaviside functions respectively. Automatic Image Segmentation for Video Capsule Endoscopy 75 2.2 Fast Implementation The discretized version of the ACWE scheme (2) can be obtained using nite differences and the method proposed in [10] follows a standard explicit central differences for the spatial variable and forward difference for time variable [11]. In this work, we modify the standard scheme by using a non-standard discretization and our method is written as follows: Let /k i;j / nMt; xi; yj   be an approximation of / t; x; y ; k  0; /0 /0 and Mt is the time step size. Consider the rst order standard differences Mx /i;j /i;j  /i1;j; Mx /i;j /i 1;j  /i;j My /i;j /i;j  /i;j1; My /i;j /i;j 1  /i;j: Then the algorithm for solving the ACWE PDE (2) is an alternating iterative scheme: 1. Fix l; k; e knowing k, compute c1( k), c2( k) from (3). 2. Compute k+1 by the following discretization and linearization of (2) in : /k 1 i;j  /k i;j Mt dh /k i;j  l h2 Mx  Mx /k 1 i;j Mx /k i;j  2 =h2 /k i;j 1  /k i;j1  2 = 2h 2 r 0 B B @ 1 C C A 2 664 l h2 My  My /i;j /k i 1;j  /k i1;j  2 = 2h 2 My /k i;j  2 =h2 r 0 B B @ 1 C C A  k1 ui;j  c1 /k    2 k2 ui;j  c2 /k    2i 4 The modi ed nite difference scheme (4) involve only rst order discrete derivatives and theoretical convergence of the above discretization will be reported elsewhere. 76 V.B. Surya Prasath and R. Delhibabu 3 Experimental Results 3.1 Setup and Parameters The core operations of the schemes are implemented in C with mex interface and MATLAB R2012a is used for visualization purposes. Our fast scheme takes about 0.1 s (40 iterations) for a 512 512 image compared to 0.32 s in a previous work [11]. This means on average the segmentation can be run for 10 frames per second (fps), making it very attractive for endoscopic image analysis and diagnosis. Enabling further code optimization via GPU may signi cantly speed up the main loop of the program. Moreover, instead of having a xed number of iterations for segmentation, we devised a tolerance check to stop the scheme at convergence. For example, /k 1  /k \106 was set, and we observed convergence of the iterative scheme (4) in less than 40 iterations for most of the images. Thus, our scheme takes average runtime of 0.1 s/frame using non-optimized MATLAB code on 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7, 8 GB RAM laptop to obtain a segmentation of lumen and mucosa. The ACWE parameters 1 = 2 = 1, and e 106 are xed for all the experi- ments reported here. This gives equal weight to both inside and outside regions of the zero level set. The parameter in Eq. (4) controls how regular the nal active contour is, and hence, affects the nal segmentation in the experiments. After conducting extensive experiments with respect to this parameter, we xed it at = 0.2, and this seems to work well for most of the images in VCE data. The time step parameter t = 0.5, step size for the nite difference grid h = 1 are xed throughout all the experiments. 3.2 Comparison Results The rst example in Fig. 2a shows the segmentation based on the proposed scheme. The original image is a typical normal mucosa of the human colon captured in vivo by the wireless capsule endoscopy device. To obtain good segmentation we always start with the initialization shown in Fig. 2a, this type of ne mesh kind of (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Fig. 2 Endoscopic image mucosa segmentation. a Input image and initialization of the modi ed ACWE scheme, see Sect. 2.2. b d Intermediate segmentation results at time t = 20, 40 and 60, curve laid on top of the original image for visualization. e Final segmentation at T = 80. The segmentation algorithm usually converges within t = 40 Automatic Image Segmentation for Video Capsule Endoscopy 77 initialization provided better segmentations. Moreover, we observed experimentally that, with a single or seed of coarse circles based initializations the proposed scheme took more iterations to converge. Figure 2b d shows the intermediate active contours of the segmentation scheme. The nal segmentation result in Fig. 2e shows the mucosal folds and the existence of a clear boundary between the lumen section of the image. Related schemes from literature are also compared in terms segmentation accuracy in mucosa-lumen differentiation. Figure 3 we show a comparison result of other segmentation schemes from the literature against our scheme. The following methods are compared with the proposed scheme (Table 1). As can be seen by comparing, white curves superimposed, in Fig. 3g of the proposed approach s segmentation result, we see that it captures mucosa regions ef ciently even if the image is of low contrast. Texture based active contour (TAC) fails completely and mean-shift obtains spurious lumen regions. On the other hand, Table 1 .

Delhibabu results of other schemes such as APT, ACWE give inaccurate segmentations of the mucosa folds. We use the Dice Similarity Coef cient, j A; B 2jA \ Bj jAj jBj ; 5 where A and B are automatic and manual segmentations respectively, and |X| denotes the total number of pixels in a set X. Dice values are in [0,1.0] with values closer to one indicate good overlap between manual and automatic segmentations. Table 2 provides Dice values for different schemes corresponding to Fig. 3. As can be seen our method obtains the highest Dice value and con rms visual comparison seen with the GT image. Similar active contour methods utilized in other imaging modalities [14 16] can also be adapted for VCE imagery and de nes our future work in this direction. 4 Conclusion In this paper, we consider automatic segmentation of video capsule endoscopy imagery. By utilizing an active contour without edges with a fast implementation we obtain meaningful segmentations of the gastrointestinal tract imaged by the capsule endoscopy. Numerical implementation of the proposed scheme is carried out with nite differences and provides ef cient segmentation results. Compared with other related image segmentation methods our fast implementation obtains better results when compared to ground-truth marked by gastroenterologists. We believe automatic computer aided diagnostic methods can provide relief to the big-data handling associated with reading video capsule endoscopy imagery and further methods for augmenting the diagnostic capabilities are required currently.

Generally, feature selection techniques are employed in such cases. However, there has been a limited study on feature selection techniques for classi cation of biological data. This work tries to determine the impact of feature selection algorithms on classi cation of kinases. We have used forward greedy feature selection algorithm along with random forest classi cation algorithm. The performance was evaluated by selecting the feature subset which maximizes Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). The method identi es the feature subset from the datasets which contains the physiochemical properties of kinases like amino acid, dipeptide, and pseudo amino acid composition. An improvised performance of classi cation is noted for feature subset than with all the features. Thus, our method indicates that groups of kinases are classi able with maximum AUC, if good subsets of features are used. P. Purkayastha (&)  A. Rallapalli  N.L. Bhanu Murthy  A. Malapati  P.

Hence, kinases annotations are necessary for understanding the pathway related to signal transduction and for understanding the disease pathway associated with impairment of kinases activity [2]. So, classi cation of kinases will provide comparison of related human kinases and insights into kinases functions and evolution. Currently the PROT R package in R was to extract the features for kinases. With a wide range of features, choosing an accurate features subset for classi cation is not an easy task. Feature selection techniques are employed in such cases. Feature selection method identi es subset of features, based on which a classi er will be trained. Feature selection is an important step in training a classi er with a subset of features, instead of training the classi er with the entire features of a dataset [3, 4]. Feature selection is bene cial in various ways. First, a packed subset of features can alleviate the curse of dimensionality and alienates the over tting problem which is usually encountered during training a classi er. Secondly, a model performs with a highly accurate extent by removing the noisy features and preprocessing the dataset. Thirdly, the accurate and essential subset of the dataset can be used with the signi cantly reduced computational cost. Finally, an illustrative subset of feature can make the model output more understandable and reasonable. Computational cost can be reduced by randomly eliminating a number of features. The major challenge lies in search of feature subset that leads to enhanced performance of a classi er by removing the redundant and unnecessary features. Consequently, the ef cacy of a feature selection method is commonly assessed by the performance of the nal model trained with the feature subset [4]. Researchers working on this problem have explored building classi cation model using in uential features, in which classi cation accuracy has thought to be the best measure for assessing the performance of a classi er. However, it has been pointed out that accuracy is not always a suitable assessment metric and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) has been proven as a better performance metric in evaluation with classi cation accuracy [5]. A classi er with minimum cost is more required than a classi er with high accuracy [6]. In this work, we have used forward greedy feature selection algorithm along with random forest classi cation algorithm and evaluated the performance based on the feature subset which maximizes AUC. 82 P. Purkayastha et al. 2 Materials and Methods The kinases groups are majorly classi ed into 10 groups, as shown in Table 1. The sequences are collected from Manning et al. classi cation and grouped accordingly [7]. The dataset consist of 530 sequences, which includes physiochemical proper- ties like amino acid composition, dipeptide composition, and pseudo amino acid composition of human kinases obtained from Prot R package. 3 Results and Discussion The performance of the random forest classi er was evaluated for all the 10 group of kinases namely, (i) Tyrosine Kinases (TK); (ii) Tyrosine Kinase-Like (TKL); (iii) Protein kinases with the families with A, G, and C (AGC); (iv) Calmodulin/Cal- cium regulated kinases (CAMK); (v) Casein kinase 1 (CK1); (vi) Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAP kinases), glycogen synthase kinases (GSK), and CDK-like kinases (CMGC); (vii) Other kinases; (viii) STE kinases; (ix) RGC kinases; and (x) Atypical kinases. The classi cation of kinases to all the 10 groups was done using the amino acid, dipeptide, and pseudo amino acid composition. The amino acid composition is of xed pattern and is of 20 amino acids. The dipeptide composition consists of 400 amino acid dipeptide combinations. The pseudo amino acid composition also contains detail information about three properties, hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and side chain mass. The pseudo amino acid composition contains features of length 80. Amino acid and dipeptide composition was used by Bhasin and Raghava for nuclear receptor classi cation [8]. Earlier pseudo amino acid composition was used Krajewski and Tkacz for structural classi cation of proteins based on pseudo amino acid composition with a measure of accuracy [9]. But recently, both theoretical and Table 1 The number of sequences belongs to each of the kinases family Kinases families Number of sequences AGC 63 Atypical 43 CAMK 79 CK1 11 CMGC 63 OTHERS 80 RGC 4 STE 47 TK 89 TKL 42 Total 530 Effect of Feature Selection on Kinase Classi cation Models 83 empirical studies revealed that a classi er with the highest accuracy extent might not be idyllic in real-world problems. Instead, the AUC has been demonstrated as the alternative approach and measure to evaluate the performance of any classi er. Therefore, we attempt to develop classi cation models using Random Forest classi er [10]. We have developed an algorithm by building the model using 2/3rd of the training dataset and remaining 1/3rd of the test dataset. The test datasets were partitioned randomly. The performance of the classi er was evaluated using AUC. Suppose we need to select k feature subset from a feature set of F = f1; f2; :::; fm f g. Forward greedy search builds model by considering one feature at a time and by calculating AUC for each of them [11]. Then, the combination feature subsets are ranked based on the descending order. The combination of features with maximum AUC value is selected for classi cation of kinases. The performance of the subset of features from the amino acid, dipeptide, and pseudo amino acid composition are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3 respectively. As shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3, an improvised performance of the classi er was obtained after applying forward greedy feature selection algorithm than with all the features. The feature selection maximizes AUC measures for all the 10 classes of kinases. AUC measured for amino acid, dipeptide and pseudo amino acid composition for all 10 classes shows a major difference in AUC measure with all 20 features than compared with feature selected subsets. The AUC measure was seen for amino acid composition in Fig. 1. The major difference in AUC measure was found for RGC class than compared with other kinase classes. The feature subset with respect to RGC class was found to be reduced to three features instead of all 20 features, using forward greedy algorithm. A negligible difference was identi ed in case of CK1 and TK classes, which could further be studied for marking a signi cant difference in all the kinase classes. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 AGC Atypical CAMK CK1 CMGC OTHERS RGC STE TK TKL Forward greedy All features AUC measure Fig. 1 The performance of the classi er for all 10 kinase classes using amino acid composition using feature subset and all features 84 P. Purkayastha et al. Similarly, the performance in AUC measure was compared using all 400 features and subset of features using dipeptide amino acid composition as shown in Fig. 2. The major difference was found in case of atypical class of kinases using all 400 features and subset of 4 features (using forward greedy) and the negligible difference was found in case of TK class. Similarly, for pseudo amino acid composition the difference measured was found to be more in case of atypical than compared with all other classes and very less in case of RGC as shown in Fig. 3. The number of features generated using forward greedy was found to contain six features with highest AUC measure. This brings us to the hypothesis that kinases can be classi ed with maximum AUC extent, if good subsets of features are used. 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 AGC Atypical CAMK CK1 CMGC OTHERS RGC STE TK TKL Forward greedy All features AUC measure Fig. 2 The performance of the classi er for all 10 kinase classes using dipeptide composition using feature subset and all features 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 AGC Atypical CAMK CK1 CMGC OTHERS RGC STE TK TKL Forward greedy All features AUC measure Fig. 3 The performance of the classi er for all 10 kinase classes using pseudo amino acid composition using feature subset and all features Effect of Feature Selection on Kinase Classi cation Models 85 4 Conclusion In this paper, we have shown the pros of feature selection method for identifying the feature subset for classi cation of kinases. The performance of the classi cation model is shown using the feature subset and using all the features. The evaluation of the performance was done by measuring AUC. The random forest classi er is able to classify kinase groups with a better AUC measure for feature subsets than compared with all the features. But the difference in AUC measure was found to be negligible for a few classes of kinase like RGC class using amino acid composition, atypical class using dipeptide, and pseudo amino acid composition which indicates that group of kinases are classi able with maximum AUC extent, if a good subset of features are used. Further, feature selection method could useful to classify large set of biological data and for dimensionality reduction. References 1.

Rheumatoid Arthritis Candidate Genes Identi cation by Investigating Core and Periphery Interaction Structures Sachidanand Singh, V.P. Snijesh and J. Jannet Vennila Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a long-term systemic in ammatory disease that primarily attacks synovial joints and ultimately leads to their destruction. The disease is characterized by series of processes such as in ammation in the joints, synovial hyperplasia, and cartilage destruction leading to bone erosion. Since RA being a chronic in ammatory complex disease, there is a constant need to develop novel and dynamic treatment to cure the disease. In the present research, network biology and gene expression pro ling technology are integrated to predict novel key regulatory molecules, biological pathways, and functional network associated with RA. The microarray datasets of synovial broblast (SF) (GSE7669) and macro- phages (GSE10500 and GSE8286), which are the primary cells in the synovium and reported as the key players in the pathophysiology of RA, were considered for identi cation of signature molecules related to RA. The statistical analysis was performed using false discovery rate (FDR), t-test, one-way anova, and Pearson correlation with favorable p-value. The K-core analysis depicted the change in network topology which consisted of up- and downregulated genes network, resulted in six novel meaningful networks with seed genes OAS2, VCAN, CPB1, ZNF516, ACP2, and OLFML2B. Hence, we propose that, differential gene expression network studies will be a standard step to elucidate novel expressed gene(s) globally.

Biological network analysis combines coexpressed gene networks to predict novel associations and key regulatory molecules. It integrates independent data as well as biologically relevant informa- tion which emerge as a reliable method to nd out meaningful novel biological network(s) [4, 24, 39]. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by in ammation, synovial hyperplasia, cartilage destruction, and bone erosion [31]. The involvement of immune cells and in ammatory molecules are basic hallmark of RA [13]. The cells of synovium are basically divided into synovial broblast (SF) and macrophages. The primary function of SF and macrophages are secretion of hyaluronic acid and phagocytosis, respectively [1, 23]. They are involved in production of various in ammatory cytokines and chemokines, which in turn attract more in ammatory molecules to the synovium [16, 35]. As together they also initiate in production of Matrix Metalloproteinase (MMP), Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF), formation of ectopic germinal layers, and over expression of Major Histocompatibility Complex Class II (MHC II) [6, 15, 18]. Recent studies have reported that both SF and macrophages play crucial role in progressive joint in ammation and destruction as they are found larger in pannus and in amed synovial membrane than in normal joints [2]. Current research work focuses on identi cation of key regulatory molecules from synovial cell layers. Microarray technology has been implemented to identify gene expression level which can be further used to detect transcriptionally altered key signature molecules involved in the pathophysiology of RA. At current times, various studies have made to predict differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in RA using multiple gene expressions [17]. In the current study, molecular expression pro les of human macrophages and SF from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were analyzed to identify promising genes for RA. Our investigation provided a valuable methodol- ogy to analyze these novel genes which are involved in the pathophysiology of RA. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Data Collection The research work focused on the key regulatory molecules involved in the pathophysiology of RA. Synovial lining consists of two types of cells SF and macrophages which are reported as the key players in the pathogenesis to RA [25, 38]. RA related microarray datasets of SF and macrophages were retrieved from GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). Overall 3 datasets, 2 from synovial macrophage 88 S. Singh et al. (GSE10500 and GSE8286) and 1 from SF (GSE7669) under Affymetrix platform were selected. The series GSE10500 consisted of 8 samples with 5 from RA patients and 3 from normal donors [44]. The dataset GSE8286 was associated with differ- entiation of monocyte to macrophage which consisted of total of 9 samples. Three each samples from monocyte at 0, 16, and 168 h were collected [22]. GSE7669 comprised of 6 samples each from RA patients and osteoarthritis patients [10]. 2.2 Data Preprocessing Each dataset was incorporated into GeneSpring GX 12.6 and raw signal values of each probe sets were normalized by baseline to median of control samples using Robust Multiarray Average (RMA) algorithm. It normalizes the raw signals by creating expression matrix from Affymetrix data by involving background correc- tion of raw signals, log2 transformation, and quantile normalization (Fig. 1) [14]. All samples in the datasets were experimentally grouped based on the content of the sample. 8 samples of GSE10500 were grouped as 3 control (normal donors) and 5 diseased (RA patients). Similar grouping was made in the case of GSE7669. But for the dataset GSE8286 grouping was made based on time and condition. Differen- tiation of monocyte to macrophage under 0 16 h and 0 168 h conditions were grouped (Fig. 2). Fig. 1 Box plot of normalized values for series GSE7669, GSE8286, and GSE10500 Rheumatoid Arthritis Candidate Genes Identi cation 89 2.3 Differentially Expressed Genes The collected datasets differ in terms of number of samples, experimental condi- tions, and type. To identify the DEGs, statistical analysis was carried out based on one-way annova, t-test, and Benjamini Hochberg False Discovery Rate (FDR). Paired t-test and unpaired t-test were performed for datasets based on the number of sample on grouping. Datasets having equal number of controlled and treated samples were performed with paired t-test. Datasets GSE10500, GSE8286, and GSE7669 followed t-test unpaired, one-way anova, and t-test paired, respectively. Direct Benjamini Hochberg FDR with p-value cutoff 0.05 and Fold Change (FC) value 1.5 and 1.5 were carried out for entire datasets to identify the signi cant expressed genes in the dataset. 2.4 Protein Network Analysis Gene gene correlation map, based on Pearson correlation with centroid linkage clustering method, was constructed for both upregulated and downregulated genes. The relationship between entire datasets was developed using Pearson s correlation coef cient (R-value) [27]. Symmetrical n n matrix was generated at R-value cutoff 0.9 and above. From the matrix, genes with high correlation value were imported to Cytoscape [34] for the network construction of coexpressed genes. In any biological network, node represents gene or protein and the interactions between these nodes are termed as degree which represents various pathways Fig. 2 Pro le plot of group for series GSE7669, GSE8286, and GSE10500 90 S. Singh et al. through which they are associated [36]. Basically, biological networks are scale free networks with statistically and functionally signi cant interacting molecules [33]. Cytoscape plugins-Network analyzer and M-Code were implemented for identifying the topology of the network keeping into consideration of K-core for identifying promising hubs [30]. It was further validated by biological analysis by Biointerpreter (http://www.biointerpreter.com/biointerpreterv3/) [42]. 3 Result and Discussion 3.1 Expression Characteristics for RA Datasets Differentially expressed genes were studied using statistical measures for each series of macrophages and broblast of synovial membrane. RMA algorithm normalized the raw signals of all the series which were under Affymetrix platform [9]. The multiple raw signals were compared using multiple hypothesis testing, p-value ( 0.05), and FC = 1.5 ( 1.5 and 1.5). The series GSE7669 of broblast resulted in 79 DEGs with 35 up- and 54 downregulated genes. There were 691 DEGs in the dataset of GSE10500 with 424 and 267 up- and downregulated genes, respectively. The series GSE8286 in multiple groups were reported a total of 145 DEGs in which group 0 16 h was in 3 and 1 and group 0 168 h in 51 and 90 up- and downregulated genes, respectively (Table 1). Higher correlation coef cient (r 0.9) with Pearson algorithm implied in gene gene correlation of DEGs resulted in 403 genes interactome (edges = 81,140) for downregulated and 510 genes interactome (edges = 183,064) for upregulated genes. The whole interactome gave a good landscape of highly correlated coexpression matrix.

The seed nodes obtained through the analysis were ZNF516, ACP2, and OLFML2B for downregulated (Fig. 3) whereas OAS2, VCAN, and CPB1 for upregulated networks (Fig. 4). Seed nodes are the highest scoring nodes in the cluster which connect all other nodes and represent the central node of connectivity [21]. The M-CODE score value ranged from 67 to 846 for Rank 1 3 (Table 2).

Singh et al. Common biological properties like angiogenensis, antigen processing and pre- sentation, immune response, vasculogenesis, chemotaxis, and in ammation con rmed that these nodes may play role in pathophysiology of RA from the cytoplasmic and nuclear level. 40 % of genes identi ed under different categories of synovial membrane (Rank 1 3 for up and Rank 1 3 for down) pointed to have correlation with the disease hyperlipidemia which is a genetic disorder of increased blood fats causing cardiovascular risk which is further connected with RA as it doubles the risk in RA patient [11, 26]. All the ranks from the both networks showed their in uence in cytokine cytokine interaction, TGF beta signaling, ECM receptor interaction, Osteoclast differentiation, and Wnt receptor signaling path- ways. Under upregulated networks, the seed gene Chondroitin Sulfate Proteoglycan (VCAN) showed its involvement in glycosaminoglycan and hyaluronic acid binding [29, 43]. Being a major component of cartilage, it is the main point of attraction for CD44 for initiating the in ammation in synovial cells [8]. Oligoadenylate Synthetase 2 (OAS2) and Carboxypeptidase B1 (CPB1) showed crossregulation and down- regulation with autoimmune diseases, respectively [37]. OAS2 was involved in IFN beta signaling pathway whereas CPB1which is present in plasma helps in brin clot by acting as a procoagulant [20, 32, 40]. CPB1 also initiates osteopontin, C5a, and bradykinin-like proin ammatory molecules [7]. Under downregulated networks, Zinc Finger Protein 516 (ZNF516), Acid phosphatase 2, lysosomal (ACP2), and Olfactomedin-like 2B (OLFML2B) showed their speci c response in stress activity Fig. 4 Seed genes on K-core analysis for upregulated network Rheumatoid Arthritis Candidate Genes Identi cation 93 speci cally in immune response [19, 28]. These genes have already indicated upregulation in cardiovascular and hormone regulation. ACP2 and OLFML2B also showed their response to hyperlipidemia disease which was connected to RA [41]. All the proteins molecules reported through network analysis showed their effect in pathophysiology of RA. Still there is wide scope to further investigate these networks which can explore more genes/proteins related to RA. 4 Conclusion The proposed research work is an expression network study frame work for RA synovial cells which may play signi cant role in its pathophysiology. The outcome resulted in six candidate seed genes which gave a better understanding of the progression of RA by different pathways involvement. This part of information may lead to better understand and manage RA in future by considering these potential targets in therapeutics.
