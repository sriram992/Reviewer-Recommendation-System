The study of meme propagation and the prediction of meme trajectory are emerg- 8 8 ing areas of interest in the eld of complex networks research. In addition to the properties 9 9 of the meme itself, the structural properties of the underlying network decides the speed and 10 10 the trajectory of the propagating meme. In this paper, we provide an arti cial framework for 11 11 studying the meme propagation patterns. Firstly, the framework includes a synthetic network 12 12 which simulates a real world network and acts as a testbed for meme simulation. Secondly, 13 13 we propose a meme spreading model based on the diversity of edges in the network. Through 14 14 the experiments conducted, we show that the generated synthetic network combined with the 15 15 proposed spreading model is able to simulate a real world meme spread. Our proposed model 16 16 is validated by the propagation of the Higgs boson meme on Twitter as well as many real 17 17 world social networks. 18 18 1 Introduction 19 19 We ape, we mimic, we mock, we act is a law universal to all human beings. Imagine a 20 20 lady in an elevator, heading to the fth oor of her of ce. Suddenly, one by one, every person 21 21 in the elevator turns back, what does she do now? According to Elevator Groupthink psy- 22 22 cology experiment [1], most of us would turn back in such a situation. Usually, most of us 23 23 become followers of the crowd when faced with our sense of conformity. If ants follow each 24 24 other with the help of the pheromone trail, humans too involuntarily imitate and follow each 25 25 others behaviours and ideas. Behaviours like obesity, smoking and altruism are also seen to 26 26 spread through social networks [2]. Today, Online Social Networks(OSNs) like Facebook and 27 27 Twitter provide a platform to ful ll people s penchant for information sharing, arguing and 28 28 mudslinging. Used by approximately 1.4 billion people worldwide [3], Facebook s Read, 29 29 Like and Share tradition has today become a way of living. Understanding these spreading 30 30 phenomena can help us in diverse ways such as accelerating the spread of useful information 31 31 i.e. health related advices or disaster management related announcements as well as for viral 32 32 marketing of products and memes. Predicting the trajectory of a meme s propagation in a net- 33 33 work can also prevent the spread of malicious rumors and misinformation. Social networks 34 34 play an instrumental role in the spread of in uence in today s world. Hence, contagion pre- 35 35 diction models are an extensively studied eld in complex networks research. Such models 36 36 evolve frequently with time, aiming to depict real world information propagation more accu- 37 37 rately. Initially, meme propagation models were inspired from compartmental epidemiological 38 38 2 Yayati Gupta, Akrati Saxena, Debarati Das and S. R. S. Iyengar models [4]. These models [5] were too simplistic and did not consider the role of edges in the 39 39 spreading of information. Later on, the advent of independent cascade [6] and linear threshold 40 40 models [7] proved seminal and these became the standardised models for meme propagation. 41 41 However, most of these models did not take into consideration the network structure and the 42 42 calculation of parameters for these models also remained a challenge. 43 43 Consider an anecdote about a small child Bob who went to visit the theme park, Six Flags 44 44 Magic Mountain in California, with his parents. Bob got lost in the Fright Fest, which is the 45 45 biggest and most terrifying maze at the theme park known for its complex spider-web like 46 46 structure. Confused by the many turns the maze took at every step, poor Bob could not nd 47 47 his way out of the Fright Fest. When Bob did not return, his worried parents contacted the 48 48 park authorities for help. These authorities having complete knowledge about the structure of 49 49 the maze and the possible paths that could be traversed by the players, could easily locate 50 50 Bob. Similarly, real world networks also have a complex yet distinct structure and if one could 51 51 understand this structure and estimate the paths that can be taken by the meme in its trajectory, 52 52 could she also not behave like the park authorities in the above analogy? In connection with 53 53 the above anecdote, the knowledge of a network s structure is important for understanding 54 54 meme propagation. It is known that the real world social networks have a very well de ned 55 55 structure. We employ this well known structure for the simulation of a meme. 56 56 The major contributions of the paper are : 57 57 1. Generation of an arti cial synthetic network that mimics a real world social network in 58 58 terms of network structure. 59 59 2. We propose a spreading model for meme propagation based on the structure of the net- 60 60 work. This model is based on the difference in spreading probabilities of different edges 61 61 which is recognised from the network itself. 62 62 The proposed synthetic network and spreading model give a synthetic simulation environment 63 63 which serves as a test-bed to study meme propagation patterns. Further, it gives a way of or- 64 64 ganising the edges in an hierarchy based on varying probabilities of information transmission 65 65 across these edges. We validate the proposed spreading model against the real world spread- 66 66 ing of the Higgs boson meme on Twitter. If one could extract the structure of of ine social 67 67 networks, our framework can be used for understanding a wide range of phenomena on of ine 68 68 networks as well in addition to online networks. In addition to controlling information ow on 69 69 OSNs, we can decrease the increasing behavioral spreading of obesity and depression in the 70 70 world and promote altruism and positive movements. Inspired from the diversity of edges in a 71 71 social network, the paper lays light on a novel aspect of looking at information propagation. 72 72 The rest of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the related work. Section 73 73 3 explains the synthetic networks in addition to describing the real world networks used for 74 74 simulation. The network structure based spreading model is proposed in Section 4. Section 5 75 75 is devoted to results and discussion. Section 6 illustrates the extension of our model as well as 76 76 future possibilities. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 7. 77 77 2 Related Work 78 78 An enormous amount of work has been done to study the information propagation pattern on 79 79 an online social network [8, 9]. Initially, memes in a social network were considered analo- 80 80 gous to a virus in a biological network [4]. As a result, most information spreading models 81 81 were inspired from compartmental epidemiological models like SIS and SIR models [5] intro- 82 82 duced in 1989. However these models assumed a homogenous mixing of people constituting 83 83 Modeling Memetics using Edge Diversity 3 the population and did not take into account interactions between the individuals. Later, in- 84 84 dependent cascade(IC) [6] and linear threshold(LT) [7] models were investigated which are 85 85 now used as the standard models for information propagation [10]. However, these models did 86 86 not consider factors like network structure and model simulation parameters. There were some 87 87 studies that predicted the parameters associated with the information propagation models [11], 88 88 but these are largely based on the utilisation of the past data, obtaining which is a dif cult pro- 89 89 cess. Studying considering the impact of network structure on a meme s propagation provide a 90 90 relative view of the meme spread. For example, the spread of epidemics is faster on scale free 91 91 networks as compared to the random networks due to the presence of hubs [12]. Zhang et al. 92 92 presents a stochastic model for the information propagation phenomenon [13]. Studying the 93 93 information propagation may help the scientists in a number of ways like halting the spread of 94 94 misinformation [14] and accelerating useful information [15] through a network. 95 95 Meme Virality prediction is an active research area in social network analysis [16, 17] and 96 96 meme propagation models can be used extensively in elds like Viral Marketing. Viral Mar- 97 97 keting can be done by targeting a set of nodes in a network as done by Kleinberg et al in 98 98 their paper on in uence maximisation [18, 19]. In uential spreaders play a signi cant role in 99 99 information propagation as shown by Kitsak et al in their work [20]. Meme virality can not 100 100 only depend on network structure and nodes in a network, it seems to be intuitive that meme 101 101 content also has a role to play in the meme becoming viral [16, 17]. Though most studies 102 102 consider nodes in their study of meme virality, we consider the property of edges in the spread 103 103 of information. An edge connecting a vulnerable node to an in uential node may have more 104 104 impact as compared to a vulnerable node to another. Our study takes the diversity of edges 105 105 into consideration and then probes into the meme pattern that can be formed. 106 106 3 Generation of Networks for Meme Simulation : SCCP 107 107 Networks 108 108 It has been observed that most of the social networks are scale free and can be generated by 109 109 the preferential attachment model. Further, these networks have communities because of the 110 110 phenomenon of homophily that leads to the formation of dense clusters in the network. We 111 111 also consider one more meso scale characteristic in the formation of network- core-periphery 112 112 structure. It has been shown that the scale free networks possess an implicit core-periphery 113 113 structure. Considering these 3 characteristics, we have tried to simulate real world networks 114 114 via SCCP networks which show properties like Scale-free structure, presence of Communities 115 115 and Core-Periphery structure. We introduce a modi cation to the algorithm [21] employed by 116 116 Wu et al. to generate these synthetic networks. The modi ed algorithm can be found in detail 117 117 in [22]. There is an implicit core-periphery structure in the generated network. It follows from 118 118 the work done by Della et al. [23]5 which proves the existence of core-periphery structure in 119 119 scale free networks.The modi ed algorithm generates synthetic scale free networks having a 120 120 varying number and sizes of communities, which is a feature prevalent in real world networks. 121 121 5 The work shows that scale free networks possess a core-periphery structure. They de ne cp-centralisation value which is a measure of the degree to which a network contains a core-periphery structure. According to this study, the average cp-centralisation value for 1000 instances of scale free networks with 100 nodes and average degree 4 is 0.668. 4 Yayati Gupta, Akrati Saxena, Debarati Das and S. R. S. Iyengar 4 Proposed Spreading Model 122 122 Meme propagation on a real world network follows the pattern of a complex contagion. Un- 123 123 like a simple contagion, the spreading pattern of a complex contagion depends on factors like 124 124 homophily and social reinforcement6. A simple contagion is like an infectious disease which 125 125 spreads with equal probability across all the edges, while a complex contagion spreads with 126 126 different probabilities depending on the factors like social reinforcement and homophily [17]. 127 127 In addition, user in uence also plays a prominent role in meme propagation. We take into 128 128 consideration all these factors in modeling the diffusion of a meme permeating through the 129 129 ties in the network. 130 130 131 131 Our model is based on two key ideas : 132 132 1. Diversity in Tie Strength : Birds of the same feather ock together . We are more en- 133 133 gaged and connected with the people in our own community as compared to people from 134 134 other communities [24]. Hence, the probability associated with the edges connecting peo- 135 135 ple of the same community should be higher than the edges connecting people of different 136 136 communities. This observation gains motivation from the theory of weak ties [25]. 137 137 2. The social status of nodes : The social in uence of a person in a network plays a big 138 138 role in acceptance of information propagated by that person. A person s social status also 139 139 decides if that person is vulnerable to adopting information. Simply stated, lower the 140 140 status, higher the vulnerability and vice versa. Higher the status, more the in uence and 141 141 vice versa. 142 142 Because of the presence of core-periphery structure in SCCP networks, there are two 143 143 kinds of nodes in a SCCP network: core nodes and periphery nodes (periphery nodes are 144 144 further divided into many communities). Initially, all the nodes are uninfected and a node turns 145 145 infected as soon as it adopts a meme. We call an infected node u, the sender and an uninfected 146 146 neighbour of u say v, the receiver of an infection. The probability of infection transmission 147 147 across an edge depends on the types of both nodes - the sender and the receiver. In our model, 148 148 the probabilities of infection across edges are divided into ve categories : 149 149 Pcc, Pcp, Ppc, Ppp0, Ppp1 150 150 Here, P represents probability. The type of edge is represented by the subscript. The sub- 151 151 script s rst alphabet denotes the type of sender node and second alphabet denotes the type 152 152 of receiver node. c represents core, p represents periphery. 0 in the subscript denotes same 153 153 community membership of sender and the receiver node, while 1 represents sender and re- 154 154 ceiver belonging to different communities. We worked towards predicting the most plausible 155 155 order for these edge probabilities, which is initially proposed to be as : Pcc > Pcp > Ppp0 > 156 156 Ppp1 > Ppc. 157 157 Our model can be considered as an extension of the simple cascade model, with a slight change 158 158 in the de nition in every iteration, each infected node tries infecting its uninfected neighbours 159 159 in accordance with the above probability hierarchy. 160 160 161 161 6 Homophily is the name given to the tendency of similar people becoming friends with each other. This leads to more number of ties between like minded people and hence leads to the formation of communities in the network. Social reinforcement is the phenomenon by which multiple exposures of an information to a person leads to him adopting it. Social reinforcement and homophily tend to block the information inside one community. Modeling Memetics using Edge Diversity 5 5 Datasets 162 162 In addition to the SCCP networks, we have used a number of other real world networks to 163 163 simulate meme s spread. These datasets are listed in Table 1. For the simulation of our spread- 164 164 ing model, we have considered the two most widely used online social networks- Facebook 165 165 and Twitter having approximately 1371 and 271 million users. For comparing our complete 166 166 framework, we use the Higgs boson meme propagation information on Twitter (dataset1). The 167 167 dataset 1 gives a complete picture of a meme spreading on an online social network along 168 168 with the information who infected whom at every step . All these considered datasets are the 169 169 examples of SCCP kind of networks. We have picked the datasets for the most popular social 170 170 networking sites. Furthermore, the datatset of Twitter in addition to the network, also gives the 171 171 retweet information of the Higgs boson meme which is used to validate the spreading model. 172 172 A detailed explanation of these datasets is given below. 173 173 Dataset Speci cation Dataset 1(a): This dataset is an induced directed unweighted subgraph on Twitter users who were involved in any of the activities(reply, retweet, or mention) regarding the Higgs boson meme7 [26]. It is an undirected unweighted graph containing 456631 nodes and 14855875 edges. Dataset 1(b): This is a directed weighted graph between the Twitter users who were involved in retweeting [27] of the Higgs Boson meme. There is an edge from B to A if A retweets B. This graph contains 425008 nodes and 733647 edges. In datasets 1(a) and 1(b), the tweets posted in Twitter about this discovery between 1st and 7th July 2012 are considered. Dataset 2: This dataset is an undirected unweighted induced subgraph on Facebook with 4039 nodes and 88234 edges [28]. Dataset 3: This dataset is an induced undirected unweighted subgraph on Twitter with 81306 nodes and 1768149 edges [28]. Dataset 4(a): These datasets have been derived from the algorithm proposed in the previous section. This is a SCCP network on 65800 nodes, 591750 edges and 11 com- munities. Dataset 4(b): This is a SCCP network on 4000 nodes, 170314 edges and 11 communities. Dataset 5 This is an Erdos-Renyi graph on 4000 nodes and 34650 edges. Table 1. Datasets used for experiments We detect communities in datasets 1(a), 2 and 3 using fast greedy modularity optimization 174 174 algorithm. This algorithm is given by Newman et. al. [29] and is used to detect community 175 175 structure for very large graphs. We also nd out the core-periphery structure for all the above 176 176 listed datasets using k-shell decomposition algorithm. We assign a coreness value to each node 177 177 equal to the shell value assigned to it by the algorithm. Then, we pick top 10% of the nodes 178 178 having highest coreness values and call them the core nodes. The remainder of the nodes are 179 179 termed periphery nodes. 180 180 181 181 6 Yayati Gupta, Akrati Saxena, Debarati Das and S. R. S. Iyengar 6 Experiments and Results 182 182 6.1 Spreading Model Validation 183 183 Our model was validated using datasets 1(a) and 1(b), where 1(a) gives us the information 184 184 about the structure of a social network and 1(b) is the cascading pattern of a meme over 1(a). 185 185 Let the dataset 1(a) be represented by G(V,E). Based on the structure of G, we partition its 186 186 nodes in two subsets C and P. C is the set of core nodes and P is the set of periphery nodes 187 187 such that C P =V and C P = /0. We also associate a variable i j with each edge Ei j. i j = 1 188 188 if nodes i and j belong to the same community, else 0. We divide the edges in the retweet 189 189 network (dataset 1(b)) in four categories based on the types of users an edge is connecting. 190 190 These categories are as follows:- 191 191 1. Ecc = {Eij E : (i C) (j C)} 192 192 2. Ecp = {Eij E : (i C) (j P)} 193 193 3. Epc = {Eij E : (i P) (j C)} 194 194 4. Epp = {Eij E : (i P) (j P)} 195 195 Epp0 = {Eij E : (i P) (j P) i j = 1} 196 196 Epp1 = {Eij E : (i P) (j P) i j = 0} 197 197 The types of nodes for 1(b) are extracted from its main graph 1(a). 198 198 199 199 In retweet networks, the weight of an edge from A to B speci es the amount of information 200 200 owing from A to B (number of times B retweeted a message from A). Therefore, more the 201 201 weight, higher the probability of information transmission across that edge. We calculate the 202 202 following weights from the above graphs:- 203 203 Let W(Eij) be the weight of an edge from node i to node j and Nxy represent the type of edges 204 204 Exy where x and y are the types of nodes hence having the possible values p and c. Then, we 205 205 calculate Wxy ,the sum of weights of all the edges from a node of type x to a node of type y. 206 206 1. Wcc = (W(Eij))/Ncc such that Ei j Ecc 207 207 2. Wcp = (W(Eij))/Ncp such that Ei j Ecp 208 208 3. Wpc = (W(Eij))/Npc such that Ei j Epc 209 209 4. Wpp = (W(Eij))/Npp | such that Ei j Epp 210 210 Wpp0 = (W(Eij))/Npp0 such that Ei j Epp0 211 211 Wpp1 = (W(Eij))/Npp1 such that Ei j Epp1 212 212 The weights obtained show that the observed order is the same as we have proposed earlier 213 213 thereby validating the ordering we proposed i.e. Wcc > Wcp > Wpp0 > Wpp1 > Wpc. 214 214 6.2 Simulation Results 215 215 We introspect on the extent as well as rate of infection of the network, while propagating a 216 216 meme on it. We simulate EBH as well as uniform spreading model on a number of datasets 217 217 and report the results. For the simulation of our proposed model, we use the following prob- 218 218 abilities: Epc : 0.00001, Epp0 : 0.0003, Epp0 : 0.0001, Ecc : 0.006, and Ecp : 0.004. For the 219 219 simulation of uniform spreading model, every edge is considered to have an equal probability 220 220 of infection i.e. Eij = 0.0002, where i and j are the endpoints of an edge. We have chosen these 221 221 probabilities such that we can visualise the spreading pattern of a meme to the best possible 222 222 extent. For all the gures in this section, X axis represents the number of iterations and Y axis 223 223 represents the cumulative number of nodes infected up to that iteration. The results of this 224 224 paper are structured in three parts : 225 225 Modeling Memetics using Edge Diversity 7 Fig. 1. Spreading patterns on different kinds of networks and its comparison to real world data - 1: Spreading patterns on datasets 3 and 4(a) 2: Spreading pattern on dataset 1(a) 3: Actual spreading pattern of Higgs boson meme(dataset 1(a) and 1(b)) 4: Comparison between the proposed spreading model on datasets 2, 4(a), and 5 5: Spreading patterns for dataset 4(a) 6: Proposed and uniform spreading models on dataset 3 Meme spreading patterns on different networks using the EBH and uniform 226 226 spreading models 227 227 Figure 1.2 shows the actual spreading pattern of the Higgs boson meme which indicates that 228 228 in the real world, a meme does not have a constant growth rate. The rate remains constant upto 229 229 some point, after which the popularity of a meme shoots up steeply and then slowly fades, 230 230 giving rise to a sigmoid curve which is characterised by the equation : F(x) = 1/(1 + e kx) 231 231 Figure 1.1 shows the simulation of our proposed spreading model on the SCCP network and 232 232 two real world networks of Facebook and Twitter. It can be seen that in both these cases, 233 233 the curve for the spreading pattern is seen to be sigmoidal just like gure 1.2. Figure 1.4 234 234 shows the difference in the spreading patterns when the simulation is done through an uniform 235 235 spreading model and our model respectively. It can be seen that the simulation through an 236 236 uniform spreading model is also a sigmoid function but has a lesser value of parameter x. 237 237 Figure 1.3 shows the simulation of the proposed spreading model on 3 different kinds of 238 238 networks. Despite simulating the EBH spreading model on all the three graphs, the value of x 239 239 is observed to be lower only in the case of random networks8 Thus we can say that the sharp 240 240 S shaped infection pattern is observed only for the SCCP kind of networks. These graphs 241 241 8 In the case of random network, even though the declared 10% core nodes have a high probability of infecting their neighbours, the connections between the core nodes are not 8 Yayati Gupta, Akrati Saxena, Debarati Das and S. R. S. Iyengar Fig. 2. Spreading patterns starting from different types of seed nodes and its comparison to real world data -1: Proposed spreading model on dataset 4(a) where spreading starts from periphery nodes 2: Proposed spreading model on dataset 4(a) where spreading starts from core nodes 3: Actual spreading pattern for the Higgs boson meme(from dataset 1(a) and 1(b)) 4: Spreading patterns starting from single community 5:Spreading patterns starting from multiple communities 6: Actual spreading pattern for the Higgs boson meme(from dataset 1(a) and 1(b)) show that the presence of both- a SCCP kind of network as well as EBH spreading model are 242 242 required to mimic a real world meme propagation. 243 243 Explanation of the plateau structure observed in the meme pattern 244 244 Figure 2.3 shows the pattern of infection of core nodes and periphery nodes for the actual 245 245 Higgs boson meme. As in the previous case, all iterations are considered to be of equal length 246 246 (10 timestamps). We observe the cumulative number of core nodes and periphery nodes in- 247 247 fected in every iteration. When we started infection from periphery nodes( gure 2.1), the 248 248 plateau structure of the curve continues till a core node is infected and then the infection 249 249 shoots up suddenly. Figure 2.2 shows the plot when the infection is started only from the 250 250 dense enough to result in an overshoot in the number of infected nodes. So, absence of a distinct core-periphery structure in such networks make them invalid for our framework Modeling Memetics using Edge Diversity 9 core nodes. We can see that in this case, infection shoots up immediately without the plateau 251 251 structure. This solidi es the observation that the number of periphery nodes infected increases 252 252 sharply as soon as a suf cient fraction of the core nodes gets infected. 253 253 Effect of communities and core nodes on meme virality 254 254 In gure 2.4, we start the infection from a single community and show that the infection 255 255 spreads in multiple communities only when the meme infects the core suf ciently and gets 256 256 viral. Figure 2.5 shows the spreading pattern when the infection starts from multiple commu- 257 257 nities. But the meme becomes viral only after the infection of core nodes. So, whether the 258 258 infection starts from single community or multiple communities, the infection of core nodes is 259 259 suf cient to predict its virality. Figure 2.6 shows the actual spreading pattern of Higgs boson 260 260 meme. 261 261 7 Conclusion and Future Work 262 262 A lot of researchers are working towards proposing the models that can predict the pattern of 263 263 meme spread in a real world network today. A number of models have been proposed for this 264 264 ranging from simple epidemiological models to the standard models like Linear Threshold and 265 265 Independent Cascade. Most of these models do not give an approach to identify the parameters 266 266 required to simulate them. Moreover, they are proposed for all kind of networks though they 267 267 can be improved upon and specialised for a particular kind of network. Hence, improving 268 268 these models to better simulate a meme propagation is possible. It is shown that, together, 269 269 SCCP and EBH models effectively simulate real world meme propagation. The sigmoid curve 270 270 with a sharp slope is shown to be the characteristic pattern of an internet meme. Furthermore, 271 271 the importance of core nodes in marking the virality of a meme is emphasised. It is also 272 272 shown that infecting multiple communities also require the infection of core nodes. The study 273 273 is validated with the Higgs boson meme spreading on Twitter in addition to various other 274 274 real world networks. This study opens a new direction of considering edge diversity in meme 275 275 propagation models. 276 276 One can extend our problem to predict the exact values of the probabilities in uencing the 277 277 meme propagation. This can greatly help in prediction of a future cascade pattern. If such 278 278 cascades could be predetermined then we could exert a control on our otherwise ever changing 279 279 social networks. Not only could preventive checkpoints be placed in the network but also 280 280 useful information could be accelerated through the network by using the predicted meme 281 281 trajectory. 282 282 8 Acknowledgement 283 283 S.R.S Iyengar was partially supported by the ISIRD grant(Ref.
