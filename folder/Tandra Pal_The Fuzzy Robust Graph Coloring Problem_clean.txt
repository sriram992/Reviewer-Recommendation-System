Fuzzy graph model can represent a complex, imprecise and uncertain problem, where classical graph model may fail. In this paper, we propose a fuzzy graph model to represent the examination scheduling problem of a university and introduce a genetic algorithm based method to nd the robust solution of the scheduling problem that remains fea- sible and optimal or close to optimal for all scenarios of the input data. Fuzzy graph coloring method is used to compute the minimum num- ber of days to schedule the examination. But problem arises if after the examination schedule is published, some students choose new courses in such a way that it makes the schedule invalid. We call this problem as fuzzy robust coloring problem (FRCP). We nd the expression for robustness and based on its value, robust solution of the examination schedule is obtained. The concept of fuzzy probability of fuzzy event is used in the expression of robustness, which in turn, is used for tness evaluation in genetic algorithm. Each chromosome in the genetic algo- rithm, used for FRCP, represents a coloring function. The validity of the coloring function is checked keeping the number of colors xed. Fuzzy graphs with di erent number of nodes are used to show the e ectiveness of the proposed method. Keywords: Fuzzy graph, fuzzy probability, fuzzy event, fuzzy graph coloring, robustness. 1 Introduction The Graph coloring problem (GCP) are used for a wide variety of applications, such as frequency assignment, time-table scheduling, register allocation, band- width allocation, circuit board testing, etc. For graph coloring problem, the decision environment is often characterized by the following facts: 1. Uncertainty is essential to human being at all levels of their interaction with the real world. So, the data are uncertain / inexact. c Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015 805 S.C. Satapathy et al. (eds.), Proc. of the 3rd Int. Conf. on Front. of Intell. Comput. (FICTA) 2014 Vol. 1, Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing 327, DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-11933-5_91 806 A. Dey et al. 2. Two adjacent vertices, assigned di erent colors, must remain feasible for all meaningful realizations of the data. 3. Bad optimal solutions, i.e., optimal solutions which become severely infea- sible in the case of even relatively small changes in the nominal data, are not uncommon. Those solutions are not robust. Here, we propose a method for graph coloring that would be able to handle those facts, mentioned above, which basically represents an uncertain environ- ment. In this paper, examination scheduling problem of a university is consid- ered. Here courses are represented by the nodes of a graph and every pair of incompatible courses is connected by an edge. The coloring of this graph pro- vides a feasible schedule of the courses and computes the minimum number of time slots which is equal to the chromatic number of the graph. Problem arises if after the examination schedule is published, some students choose a new course that makes the schedule invalid. This type of uncertainty exists in real world. Uncertainty of data comes from two di erent sources: randomness and incom- pleteness. Fuzzy graph model is used when uncertainty is there in the description of the objects or in its relationships or in both. Let x be an optimal solution of an examination scheduling problem. But after scheduling, the input data changes. The change may be caused due to many reasons, e.g., new preliminaries are to be considered, data is updated or there may be some disturbances. In that new situation, the previous optimal solution x may not be feasible or if feasible, may not be optimal. A solution is considered as robust if it is still feasible and optimal or nearly optimal if changes of the input data occur within a prescribed uncertainty set. It protects the decision maker against parameter ambiguity and stochastic uncertainty. There are few works on graph coloring problems with robustness. However, there is no work, as per our knowledge, that has incorporated robustness and fuzzy graph coloring in an integrated manner for scheduling problem. Works on robustness in scheduling problem can be found in [9], [8], [4], [3]. Some works related to fuzzy graph coloring are there in [1], [6], [7], [5]. A work, somewhat similar to us, can be found in [9]. However, the authors have used crisp graph to represent the model. In their robust graph coloring problem (RGCP) at most c colors can be assigned to all the vertices of the graph, where c is the given number of available colors. RGCP imposes a penalty for each pair of nonadjacent vertices if they are equally colored. Accordingly, the objective of the RGCP is to minimize the rigidity level of the coloring, which is de ned as the sum of such penalties. They have proposed a genetic algorithm to nd the robust solution for the problem. In this paper, we propose a method to nd the robust solution of an exami- nation scheduling problem of a university in uncertain environment. We call this problem as Fuzzy robust coloring problem (FRCP). Probability of fuzzy event is used to bridge the crisp world (probability) and real world (fuzzy). We use a genetic algorithm for FRCP, where each chromosome represents an ordered arrangement of nodes without repetition and is checked its validity keeping the number of colors xed. Here, we propose a tness function for the chromosome Robust Fuzzy Coloring 807 based on the concept of fuzzy probability of a fuzzy event. Roulette wheel se- lection, two point crossover and one point mutation are used in the genetic algorithm. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 brie y reviews some basic de - nations associated with fuzzy graph coloring and probablity. In Section 3, we describe the examination scheduling problem by fuzzy graph model. We present an algorithm based on GA for FRCP in Section 4. The results of the proposed approach are presented in Section 5. Finally, we conclude in Section 6. 2 Preliminaries In this section, we present some de nitions related to fuzzy graph and fuzzy probability, which are associated with the proposed model. De nition 1 [7]. Let V be a nite non empty set. A fuzzy graph G is de ned by a pair of functions and , G = ( , ). is a fuzzy subset of V and is a symmetric fuzzy relation on , i.e., : V [0, 1] and : V V [0, 1] such that (u, v) ( (u) (v)) , u, v V (1) A fuzzy graph is a generalization of crisp graph. De nition 2 [6]. A fuzzy graph G = ( , ) is a complete fuzzy graph if (x, y) = ( (u) (v)) , u, v (2) De nition 3 [7]. The complement of a fuzzy graph G = ( , ) is also a fuzzy graph and it is denoted as G = ( , ), where = and (u, v) = (u) (v) (u, v) (3) De nition 4 [10][11]. Let event A is a fuzzy event or a fuzzy set considered in the space n. All events in the space n are mutually exclusive and the probability of each event is as follows. P( A) =  x  A  A(x)P(x) (4) Here,  A(x) is the membership function of the event A. De nition 5 [5]. A family = { 1, 2, ..., k} of fuzzy subsets on V is called a k- fuzzy coloring of G = ( , ) if (a) 1 2 ... k = (b)min{ i(u), j(u) | 1 i = j k} = 0, u V (c)For every strongly adjacent vertices u, v of G, min{ i(u), i(v)} = 0 (1 i k) Fuzzy chromatic number of fuzzy graph G is the least value of k for which the G has k-fuzzy coloring and is denoted by F (G). 808 A. Dey et al. Fig. 1. Fuzzy graph model of an examination schedule 3 The Examination Scheduling Problem Let us consider an example of examination scheduling problem, where the exam- ination of 6 courses of a particular program at a university has to be scheduled. Two courses sharing at least one student cannot be scheduled on the same day. Taking into account the course incompatibilities, a fuzzy graph G = ( , ), shown in Fig 1, is constructed, where a node / vertex represents a course and an edge {i, j} is included in the edge set when the courses i and j share at least one student. Here, and are respectively the membership values of the vertices and edges. Membership value of a node measures the degree to which an event occurs. Let the membership values of the vertices of the fuzzy graph are (1) =0.3, (2) = 0.5, (3) = 0.6, (4) = 0.5, (5)= 0.4 and (6)= 0.7. We use a complete fuzzy graph to represent the problem and nd the membership values of the edges using (2). In order to minimize the duration of examinations, a minimal coloring problem is considered. From the De nition 5, the fuzzy chromatic number of the fuzzy graph is computed as F (G) = 3 and the following coloring 0 1, in this sense, is optimal. 0 1(u1) = 0.3 i = 1 0.4 i = 5 0, otherwise 0 1(u2) = 0.5 i = 2 0.5 i = 4 0, otherwise 0 1(u3) = 0.6 i = 3 0.7 i = 6 0, otherwise. Robust Fuzzy Coloring 809 Table 1. Probability and membership values of edges of G {i, j} E prij i,j 1-5 0.0506 0.3 1-6 0.0127 0.3 2-4 0.4557 0.5 2-5 0.3038 0.4 3-4 0.1519 0.5 3-6 0.0253 0.6 We measure the probability of the fuzzy event [11], [10] and use it as robustness value of the model. The fuzzy probability that a complementary edge will be added to the graph is computed. Using (3), we also compute the membership values of all complementary edges of the fuzzy graph, shown in Table 1. The robustness of the coloring can be measured as the fuzzy probability of such coloring after one random complementary edge has been added to the edge set. We assume that the probability of the complementary edge {i, j} be proportional to the number of students registered in courses i and j. Let n = 50 be the total number of students who has chosen two out of the six courses and ni be the number of students registered in course i. In this example, we consider n1 = 5, n2 = 30, n3=10, n4=30, n5=20 and n6 = 5. Given the coloring 0 1, the probability that the coloring remains valid, assum- ing statistical independence, can be computed as follows. (1 pr15 1,5) (1 pr24 2,4) (1 pr36 3,6)=0.9477 Let us consider the following coloring 1 1, 1 1(u1) = 0.3 i = 1 0.7 i = 6 0, otherwise 1 1(u2) = 0.5 i = 2 0.4 i = 5 0, otherwise 1 1(u3) = 0.6 i = 3 0.5 i = 4 0, otherwise. Then the corresponding fuzzy probability is (1 pr16 1,6) (1 pr25 2,5) (1 pr34 3,4)=0.80866 If the number of days to schedule the examination is not 3 as before, say 4, the fuzzy probability increases choosing the following coloring 2 1. 2 1(u1) = 0.3 i = 1 0.4 i = 5 0, otherwise 2 1(u2) = 0.6 i = 3 0.7 i = 6 0, otherwise 810 A. Dey et al. 2 1(u3) =  0.6 i = 2 0, otherwise 2 1(u4) =  0.5 i = 4 0, otherwise The fuzzy probability that this coloring 2 1 remains valid is (1 pr15 1,5) (1 pr36 3,6)=0.96987, which is more than the previous two colorings. 4 Proposed Genetic Algorithm for FRCP Genetic Algorithm [2] is a probabilistic heuristic search process based on the con- cepts of natural genetics. Given an examination scheduling problem, proposed genetic algorithm nds the robust solution for this problem. Below we describe the chromosome encoding, tness function, coloring function and genetic opera- tors. 4.1 Encoding Each node in the graph is represented by a unique integer value. A chromosome represents an order of all nodes without repetition. Thus, the chromosome length is same as the number of vertices in the graph. We have to nd a coloring function for each chromosome and check its validity keeping the number of colors xed. 4.2 Fitness Function The value of the tness function is a measure of the quality of a solution. More is the tness, better the solution is. For FRCP, the tness of ith chromosome, given below in (5), is calculated using the penalty values and the membership values of the complimentary edges. R(Ci) represents the rigidity level of the coloring function C of the ith chromosome. Thus, it is a minimization problem. R(Ci) =  {i,j} E,C(i)=C(j) pij i,j (5) Here, i,j and pij are respectively the membership value and the penalty value of the edge (i, j). The penalty values for the complimentary edges and membership values of the vertices are generated randomly with uniform distribution in the interval [0, 1]. 4.3 Greedy Algorithm Given the adjacency matrix of a graph and an optimal order of nodes optorder, greedy algorithm, presented below in Algorithm 1, construct a coloring C: {1, 2, ..., c}, such that for every edge (i, j), C(i) = C(j). Robust Fuzzy Coloring 811 Algorithm 1. Greedy Algorithm 1: begin 2: for i=1 to n do 3: set color(i) = 0 4: end for 5: Set color(optorder(1)) = 1 6: for j=2 to n do 7: Choose a color k >0 for the node optorder(j) that di ers from its neighbor s colors 8: end for 9: end Let us consider the chromosome 4 1 3 2 6 5, which is an ordered arrangement of the nodes for the fuzzy graph shown in Fig. 1. We take this order as the optimal order. First, node 4 is colored with color 1.The next node in the optimal order is node 1, which is adjacent to node 4, cannot be colored with color 1. So, node 1 is assigned color 2. Similarly, we traverse through the optimal ordering one by one and assign colors to each node so that every node has a color di erent from the colors of its neighboring nodes. We nally get a coloring C as C(1) = 2, C(2) = 3, C(3) = 1, C(4) = 1, C(5) = 3, and C(6) = 2. 4.4 Genetic Operators We use Roulette wheel selection. A two point crossover is used in the proposed approach, which is described in Fig. 2. Two parents P1 and P2 are selected from the mating pool and the following operation is performed to obtain two children C1 and C2. Step 1. Choose two random points cp1 and cp2 such that cp1 <cp2. Step 2. Copy the nodes from P2 into C1 starting from position cp1 to the posi- tion cp2. Step 3. Traverse the nodes of P1 one by one from 1 to n, if a node of P1 is not already present in C1 then copy it into C1 at the rst available position from 1 to n. Step 4. Copy the nodes from P1 into C2 starting from position cp1 to the posi- tion cp2. Step 5. Traverse the nodes of P2 one by one from 1 to n, if a node of P2 is not already present in C2 then copy it into C1 at the rst available position from 1 to n. For mutation two points or positions are selected randomly from a chro- mosome and the nodes in those positions are exchanged. It is illustrated in Fig. 3. 812 A. Dey et al. Fig. 2.

The results of the proposed approach on a set of graphs with number of nodes 6, 8, 10 and 12 are shown in Table 2. The results for same set of graphs using binary programming with the same penalty and membership values are also shown in Table 2. Our results are more or less similar to those of binary programming. It shows the e ectiveness of the proposed approach on GA. Here, we consider binary programming as we did not nd, best of our knowledge, any existing algorithm for robustness on fuzzy graph. The results show that for a particular graph when the number of colors increases the rigidity level of the coloring function decreases. The rigidity level is a measure of penalty when the coloring function becomes invalid on addition of any complimentary edge. The lower is the value of rigidity, the probability of the coloring function to be invalid is less. Robust Fuzzy Coloring 813 6 Conclusions In this work, we present the fuzzy robust graph coloring model that is simple, exible, and easy to communicate to decision maker. With this model, we ad- dress the examination scheduling problem under uncertainty based on genetic algorithm, which produces robust solutions. Uncertainty in data comes from two di erent sources: randomness and vagueness. This model handles both type of uncertainty in decision making and bridges fuzzy graph coloring with robust optimization. Our model is capable of solving many real world optimization problems in uncertain environment. References 1. Blue, M., Bush, B., Puckett, J.: Uni ed approach to fuzzy graph problems.
