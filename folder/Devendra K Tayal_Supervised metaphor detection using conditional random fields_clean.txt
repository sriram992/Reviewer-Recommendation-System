Tayal** *Dept. of CoE, Netaji Subhas Institute of Technology, University of Delhi, India **Dept. of CSE, Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women, India {post2srai, apmahs.nsit}@gmail.com, dev_tayal2001@yahoo.com Abstract In this paper, we propose a novel approach for supervised classification of linguistic metaphors in an open domain text using Conditional Random Fields (CRF). We analyze CRF based classification model for metaphor detection using syntactic, conceptual, affective, and word embeddings based features which are extracted from MRC Psycholinguistic Database (MRCPD) and WordNet-Affect. We use word embeddings given by Huang et al. to capture information such as coherence and analogy between words. To tackle the bottleneck of limited coverage of psychological features in MRCPD, we employ synonymy relations from WordNet . A comparison of our approach with previous approaches shows the efficacy of CRF classifier in detecting metaphors. The experiments conducted on VU Amsterdam metaphor corpus provides an accuracy of more than 92% and F- measure of approximately 78%. Results shows that inclusion of conceptual features improves the recall by 5% whereas affective features do not have any major impact on metaphor detection in open text. 1 Introduction According to Merriam-Webster dictionary, Metaphor1 is defined as a figure of speech in which a word or a phrase literally denoting one kind of object or idea is used in place of another to suggest a likeness or analogy between them . As a literary tool, metaphor is popular and widely appreciated for the novelty and vividness it provides to an otherwise bland text. Contrary to the popular belief that metaphor is a tool for poetry, we see vast usage of metaphors in common parlance and even in scientific discourses like economics, security and 1Merriam-Webster Dictionary, Metaphor: http://www.mer- riam-webster.com/dictionary/metaphor politics. To achieve human computer interaction in the true sense, Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems need to be enhanced to process and understand metaphors and indeed, all kinds of figurative speeches in a continuous and open- domain text. Interpreting metaphor in a language is a complicated task because the metaphorical meaning of a sentence depends on what a speaker actually wants to convey irrespective of the literal meaning of the words used (Searle, 1985). Thus, the literal meaning of words needs to be modified according to the contextual presentation of the metaphor (Gibbs, 1984). A linguistic metaphor indicates a domain that seems incongruous with the surrounding context but presents the underlying belief by re-conceptualization (Lynne and Deignan, 2003). Interestingly, we observe that unlike the process of metaphor interpretation, a linguistic metaphor can be detected by analyzing word properties and surrounding words i.e. context, to identify the incongruity it causes in the sentence without even examining the reconceptualization involved. One of the earliest criteria for metaphor detection in a text was proposed by Wilks (1978). He stated that a metaphorical interpretation is made when literal interpretation makes no sense or is out of context, a condition known as violation of selectional preference, e.g. My car drinks gasoline. (Wilks, 1978) (a) However, metaphors occur even without violation of selectional preference, e.g. All men are animals. (b) 18 We also observe that combinations such as <car, drink> and <drink, gasoline> have very low co- occurrence frequency in a corpus. Lakoff and Johnson (1980) introduced another perspective and termed it as conceptual metaphor which regards metaphor as a product of cognitive phenomenon, and a way to explain abstract concepts such as argument by mapping them to concrete ones such as war, e.g. The committee shot down her ideas one by one. (c) Here in (c), the concrete concept, shot is used to explain the outright rejection of an abstract concept namely, ideas. Thus, conceptual features like abstractness (Turney et al., 2011) or concreteness (Klebanov et al., 2015), familiarity or rarity (Schulder and Hovy, 2014), imageability (Strzalkowski et al., 2013) and sensory features (Gargett and Barnden, 2015) can improve automatic metaphor detection. Recently, Hovy et al. (2013) utilized word embeddings by Collobert et al. (2011) for capturing coherence and contextual features for supervised metaphor detection. In this paper, we strive to provide a solution to the fundamental problem of metaphor processing i.e. metaphor detection in text. We propose a novel approach for binary classification of continuous, open-domain text into Metaphor or otherwise, using Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et al., 2001) and a hybrid feature set. CRF has widespread applications in computational linguistics. In contrast with (Gedigan et al., 2006) and (Turney et al., 2011) which focus on verb and adjective centric metaphors, we extend the applicability of CRF to detect all kinds of metaphor. The idea is to develop an effective and computationally inexpensive process to filter out metaphors in an open text. Unlike the majority of earlier works which focused on utilizing a particular type of feature set, we propose a rich and hybrid feature set to cover different aspects of a metaphor. We include features that pertain to sentence structure, psychological/conceptual properties of a word, affective interpretation which provides information on whether a word conveys a mood, a mental state or an emotion and the context of a word's usage using word embeddings. We analyze their effect on metaphor detection individually and in combination. We use Medical Research Council Psycholinguistic Database (MRCPD) (Wilson, 1988) for extracting conceptual features and WordNet-Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) for extracting affective features. Further, we employ WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) to expand the limited coverage of psychological features in MRCPD. We utilize word embeddings (Huang et al., 2012) as contextual features which provides semantic information for a word such as coherence, context, relatedness and analogy. The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of existing literature on detection of metaphor. Section 3 delineates our proposed approach for metaphor detection, the feature sets used and extension of MRCPD by using WordNet . We demonstrate our experiments and results in Section 4 and conclude our work in Section 5. 2 Related Work Some of the earliest works in metaphor detection used concept of violation of selectional preference given by Wilks (1978). These include the system MIDAS (Martin, 1990) and met* (Fass, 1991), both of which are hand-coded rule-based systems. The work in (Mason, 2004) introduced a corpus based approach viz. CorMet to identify conventional non- literal phrases from a domain specific text. Recently, Baumer et al. (2010) proposed an approach based on selectional preference given by Resnik (1993) to detect conceptual metaphors. Several researchers used clustering based techniques to identify non-literalness in text. Birke and Sarkar (2006) proposed the Trope Finder (TroFi) system to recognize verbs with non-literal meaning using Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and clustering. However, TroFi doesn't identify the type of non-literalness i.e. whether it is a metaphor or some other non-literal category such as idiom, sarcasm etc. Shutova et al. (2010) pointed out that a target concept associated with the same source concept are more likely to co-occur in similar lexico-syntactic environments. They proposed a clustering based technique using grammatical relations and lexical features to detect metaphors. In (Birke and Sarkar, 2007), the authors introduced the concept of Active Learning using an existing similarity based WSD algorithm (Karov and Edelman, 1998) to annotate a corpus for non-literal language. 19 Some researchers used knowledge resources to strengthen the approaches for metaphor detection. The work in (Gedigian et al., 2006) proposed a technique to detect metaphorical verb usage by utilizing existing knowledge sources such as WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998), FrameNet (Baker et al., 1998) and PropBank (Kingsbury and Palmer, 2002). Krishnakumaran and Zhu (2007) proposed an approach on the basis of violations in co- occurring noun and verb phrases using WordNet hierarchies. The works in (Mohler et al., 2013) and (Wilks et al., 2013) also utilized WordNet ontology for recognizing metaphors. Dunn (2013) proposed a domain interaction system namely Measuring and Identifying Metaphor in Language (MIMIL) using SUMO ontology (Niles and Pease, 2011). The default sense of lexical items in a sentence were mapped to concepts from SUMO ontology on the basis of domain type and event status. Tsvetkov et al. (2014) and Bracewell et al. (2014) used the concept of hybrid feature set by using features from WordNet, MRCPD and vector representations. Klebanov et al. (2015) evaluated the effect of concreteness as a feature for metaphor detection using MRCPD. Gargett and Branden (2015) proposed using sensory features to enhance the process of metaphor detection using Affective Norms for English Word (ANEW) and MRCPD. Ferrari (1996) proposed an approach based on the analysis of syntactic patterns and used textual cues such as metaphorically, figuratively and like to detect metaphors. The works in (Sardinha, 2002; Sardinha, 2006) suggested using corpus-based metrics such as collocations list, word frequency and semantic-distance for metaphor detection. Turney et al. (2011) observed that metaphorical usage is directly correlated with the degree of abstractness in a word s contextual usage. They proposed an approach to identify metaphorical verbs and adjectives using an algorithm to calculate abstractness given in (Turney and Littman, 2003). Hovy et al. (2013) proposed an approach based on features derived from syntactic patterns and word embeddings (Collobert et al., 2011) to analyze the context of a word usage. They used Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier with tree kernels to identify metaphorical words. Strazalkowski et al. (2013) utilized topic chaining and imageability score to identify metaphorical usage in text. Neuman et al. (2013) developed a rule based approach which combines selectional preference and abstractness of words to identify metaphors. Schulder and Hovy (2014) proposed a statistical domain-independent approach based on a metric term relevance derived from Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF). A term is categorized as metaphor if the domain relevance and common relevance for a given term is lower than a predetermined threshold. Our work is different from earlier works in terms of improved and rich feature set that we employ. Unlike previous works which used a subset of conceptual features, we utilize a multifarious feature set. Along with that, we introduce different affective features which deal with abstract concepts like mental state, physical state, and behavioral characteristics. We systemically extend the coverage of MRCPD to include unavailable terms rather than taking average values as in (Gargett and Branden, 2015). To the best of our knowledge, CRF for metaphor classification has not yet been fully investigated, especially in the context of large, and overlapping feature set. Hovy et al. (2013) compared their proposed approach with CRF. However they did not emphasize on the feature set and relations which can be exploited while using a CRF model. 3 Proposed Methodology Our methodology is based on an innovative applica- tion of CRF on an amalgamation of syntactic, con- ceptual, affective and word embeddings based fea- tures extracted by using corpus and knowledge re- sources. We now give a detailed description of the features that we have employed, our technique for expanding the coverage of MRCPD using WordNet and an approach to build a CRF model for Metaphor Detection. 3.1 Feature Set We have built a hybrid feature set drawing upon traditional features as well as on the basis of our inferences from the existing literature that are likely to enhance the process of metaphor detection. The feature set is categorized into four categories namely, Syntactic Feature set, , Conceptual feature set, , Affective feature set, and Contextual feature set, . 20 3.1.1 Syntactic Features The set of syntactic features (SF) is defined as a feature vector = { 1, 2, , FS5}, based on a word attributes, sentence structure and dependency between components of a sentence. We use Stanford CoreNLP (Manning et al., 2014) to extract following syntactic features: 1. Lemma: It includes lemmas i.e. the base form, for all tokens in the corpus. 2. PoS: It denotes grammatical word-category such as noun, verb etc. for each word in a sentence. 3. Named_Entity_Type: It marks named, numerical and temporal entities such as person, location, money, number, date, time etc. 4. Dependency: It provides information about the position of a word with respect to grammatical structure of a sentence including relations between words and modifiers. 5. Stop_word: It marks a word as content or non- content word, based on a list of stop-words. 3.1.2 Conceptual Features The set of conceptual features (CF) is defined as a feature vector, FC= {FC1, FC2, , FC5}, which consists of features based on the meaning, abstract attributes of a word and its measured impact on a large corpus. We use MRCPD (Wilson, 1988), a large psycholinguistics database to extract the conceptual features of a word enumerated below (Gilhooly and Logie, 1980; Paivio and Madigan, 1968; Toglia and Battig, 1978). These conceptual features have numerical values ranging from 100 to 700. 1. Concreteness: It is a measurement of the ability of a word to refer to concrete concepts. 2. Familiarity: It refers to a feeling of knowing the word or concept behind a word, depending upon how commonly the word is used. 3. Imageability: It refers to the expressiveness of a word to evoke a visual image of the concept behind the word. 4. Frequency: It refers to the frequency of occurrence of a word sense in the Brown corpus. 5. Meaningfulness: It is a measure of the association of a given word with other words. We utilize the Colerado based Meaningfulness rating, MEANC. 3.1.3 Affective Features The set of affective features (AF) is defined as a feature vector, FA= {FA1, FA2, , FA5}, based on the affective concepts correlated with an affective word. We use WordNet Affect (Strapparava and Valitutti, 2004) to extract following affective features: 1. Cognitive_State: It denotes mental state or feelings such as confusion. Labels mood, sensation, emotional response are merged with cognitive state label because of very few instances and indirect dependence. 2. Physical_State: It refers to physical or bodily state such as illness. 3. Trait: It denotes characteristics of personality such as aggressiveness. 4. Attitude: The label behavior and attitude are merged together as they are interrelated. 5. Emotion: It refers to emotional state or process such as joy, anger. 3.1.4 Contextual Features Word Embeddings provide semantic information about a word and are capable of comparing words on basis of relatedness, analogy, coherence and con- text, the criteria we use for metaphor detection as well. We use word embeddings by Huang et al. (2012) as it captures local i.e. syntactic information as well global context based on word's usage in large corpus. CWE is trained using local context only. Word embeddings are used as contextual fea- tures (XF) and represented as a 50 dimensional vec- tor, FX= {FX1, FX2, , FX50}. 3.2 Extending MRCPD using WordNet The MRCPD resource contains linguistic information for over 150,000 words. However, psycholinguistic features are available only for a limited number of words. A total of 8228 words are available for Concreteness rating, 9392 for Familiarity, 9240 for Imageability and 5450 words for Colerado norms based meaningfulness rating (Wilson, 1988). As a result, several words which are used frequently is not available in the database. Liu et al. (2014) proposed extending MRCPD for imageability rating using synonymy and hyponymy relations from WordNet. We strive to use a rich feature set comprising of other features such as 21 concreteness, familiarity and meaningfulness, thus expanding MRCPD for all of these features. WordNet (Princeton University, 2010) is an online machine readable lexical database for English language developed by Christiane Fellbaum at Princeton University. In WordNet , words are grouped on the basis of cognitive concepts known as synset, a set of synonymous words. Senses in a synset are arranged in a form of a list on the basis of decreasing frequency count in the Brown corpus (Francis and Kucera, 1979) For example, if we search the word, man, we observe that its first sense <man#1, adult-male#1> sense has occurred 749 times in the Brown corpus whereas its second sense <homo#2> occurred only 29 times. So, we can say, that highest ranked sense is the most frequently used sense for a word. We use this inference to prioritize senses in our technique to extend the coverage of words with psychological features in MRCPD. The hyponymy relation provide a more specific instance for a concept. E.g. for the word, beverage, we obtain {milk, tea, wish-wash, hydromel, oenomel, soft drink etc.} as hyponymy concepts. However, hydromel, oenomel, wish-wash are relatively less familiar, have lower imageability, and have a lower probability of co-occurrence with other concepts. Therefore, we find it more judicious to consider only synonymy relations from WordNet while expanding MRCPD. As an example, consider the word, deviance which is not in MRCPD. We extract its synset {aberrance, aberration, deviation} from WordNet in order of decreasing Brown frequency. Next, we check the availability of each of these synonyms in MRCPD until a match is found. In this case, the word, aberration is available in MRCPD. Therefore, the conceptual features for aberration is assigned to deviance. Similarly, in case of courtroom, the word court is selected as a substitute and its conceptual features are extracted. 3.3 Approach The proposed approach is divided in three phases namely, Data Processing, Feature Extraction and Model Building. 1. Data Processing phase: This involves data cleaning, tokenization and conversion to 2 CoNLL Data Format: http://ilk.uvt.nl/conll/#dataformat CoNLL2 data format. After data processing, we obtain a sequence of tokens derived from sentences of the corpus. 2. Feature Extraction phase: This is sub-divided into four parts: Syntactic Feature Extraction, Conceptual Feature Extraction, Affective features extraction and Contextual feature extraction. The extraction process is explained in subsections 3.1 and 3.2. We use a context window of 7 words i.e. the word itself, 3 previous words and 3 next words, whose features are used to predict the label/class of a token. 3. Model Building phase: CRF (Lafferty et al., 2001) is a probabilistic sequence labelling algorithm which takes an input sequence X, and predict the class label, Y. Since we are performing binary classification, Y consists of only two labels namely {M, NM} where M stands for metaphor and NM for otherwise cases. CRF doesn't make the assumption that features are independent and it is capable of handling large number of inter-independent or over- lapping features unlike joint probability based models such as HMM which becomes intractable in such cases. In our approach, these dependencies are defined by analyzing their effect on precision and recall. Thus, creating a feature set more aligned towards precise detection of metaphor without compromising recall. Features are defined in a template file (in case of CRF++) along with the context window and inter- dependencies between different features such as concreteness/pos, imageability/concreteness, cognitive_state/concreteness and so on. X1:N is a feature vector which is generated on the basis of a given template file. The joint distribution for the label sequence Y given X is as in eq. (1): ( | , ) = 1 ( ) exp ( ( 1, , , ) ) (1) Where ( 1, , , ) is a feature/transition function, 1, are class labels, x is an input sequence and i is an input position, Z(x) is a Normalization factor and is a parameter vector. The elements of the parameter vector, { k} RK are calculated from the training data to maximize the likelihood of p(y|x). 22 4 Experiments and Results We used CRF++ (V0.58) (Kudo, 2005), an open source C++ implementation of CRF based classifier for our experiments and VU Amsterdam Metaphor Corpus as dataset. 4.1 Dataset We used VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus (Steen et al., 2010) developed by MIP Pragglejaz group. The annotation for metaphor in a sentence is based on anomaly between basic meaning of the term and contextual meaning of the term in the given sentence (Pragglejaz Group, 2007). The corpus is a small set of BNC Baby manually annotated for metaphors in XML format. For our experimental purpose, we converted the XML dataset into CoNLL format. We have considered words marked with MRW-Met sub-class as Metaphor and all other categories as Non-Metaphor. In original files, total number of metaphors is 25496, however in few cases we have separated multi-word expressions and marked all of them as Metaphor or Not Metaphor (whichever is the initial case) which led to minor increase in total number of metaphors. We have performed 10-fold cross validation across every genre as well as on overall dataset say Dataset2. The percentage of metaphor in each dataset is given in Table1.

During feature extraction, we observed that affective features are too sparse i.e. exists in case of affective words only which is around 11% (refer Table2). Therefore, affective feature set is merged with conceptual feature set to analyze its effect on metaphor detection in an open domain dataset.

Table 7: Metaphor Detection using CRF classifier on Hybrid Feature (SF+CF+AF+XF) set Analysis: Extension of MRCPD with WordNet led to higher coverage and fewer missing values in conceptual feature vector. From the results in Table 3-4, we observed that inclusion of conceptual features significantly improved recall (up to 5%) for metaphors however it didn't have any visible effect on precision. Due to sparse affective feature vector, we could not observe any major impact on either precision or recall on adding affective feature set (refer Table5). Contextual Features i.e. embeddings with Syntactic features was also effective in recognizing metaphors but did not supersede the feature set {SF+CF} (refer Table4 and Table6). The combination {SF, CF, AF} (refer Table5) and {SF, CF, AF, XF} (refer Table8) didn't show any significant improvement over feature set {SF+CF}. We gathered that presence of open category words (non-content words) such as determiners, conjunction etc. limited the effect of inter- dependent features. Consider the following sentence (metaphors in bold): It would be also necessary to smash the decrepit, effete constitution that allows a minority to capture power, and then use it ruthlessly in the interests of the privileged few . Here, smash is used metaphorically. Despite of considering a context window of 7 words i.e. also necessary to smash the decrepit effete, we were unable to capture object of interest, i.e. constitution. 4.3 Comparison We compared our approach with approaches pro- posed by Dunn (2013), Klebanov et al. (2015) and Hovy et al. (2013). Dunn used logistic regression classifier implemented in WEKA (Hall, 2009) on features extracted from SUMO Ontology. Klebanov et al. (2015) used concreteness as a feature with baseline features (Klebanov et al., 2014) and opti- mal weighting technique. The dataset used was VU Amsterdam Metaphor corpus. Hovy et al. (2013) used SVMlight Tree Kernel (TK) implementation by (Moschitti, 2006) with syntactic features and CWE. However, they conducted the experiments on their own dataset, say Dataset3.

From Table8, we observed that CRF based classifier with {SF+CF+AF+XF} feature set outperformed approaches proposed by Dunn (2013) and Klebanov et al. (2015) in terms of accuracy, precision and F- measure (refer Table8). Klebanov et al. (2015) approach was based on optimal weighting to obtain optimal F-score which lead to comparatively higher recall. It is worth noting that accuracy increased by 18.96% and precision by 6.19% with respect to system proposed by Hovy et al. (2013). However, Hovy et al. (2013) outperformed in terms of recall 24 and F-measure for metaphor class. The problem of low recall is likely to be resolved by optimizing the model for optimal F-measure as in Klebanov et al. (2015). 5 Conclusion We used a CRF based classifier to perform metaphor detection in text. Using a rich feature set and a wide context window, we demonstrated the advantage of using CRF classifier over other classifiers in terms of accuracy and precision. We analyzed the efficacy of using CRF classifier over various combinations of feature sets. We expanded the coverage of the conceptual features of MRCPD using WordNet ontology, resulting in significant improvement in the recall of metaphor detection. In future, we would like to conduct an in-depth analysis of affective features, fine-tune the process of feature selection and develop a multi-stage model for metaphor processing.
