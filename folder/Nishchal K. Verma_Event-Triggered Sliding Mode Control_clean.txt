Event-Triggered Sliding Mode Control for Trajectory Tracking of Nonlinear Systems Aquib Mustafa, Student Member, IEEE, Narendra K. Dhar, and Nishchal K Verma, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract In this paper, an event-triggered sliding mode con- trol approach for trajectory tracking problem of nonlinear input affine system with disturbance has been proposed. A second or- der robotic manipulator system has been modeled into a general nonlinear input affine system. Initially, the global asymptotic sta- bility is ensured with conventional periodic sampling approach for reference trajectory tracking. Then the proposed approach of event-triggered sliding mode control is discussed which guaran- tees semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness. The proposed control approach guarantees non-accumulation of control up- dates ensuring lower bounds on inter-event triggering instants avoiding Zeno behavior in presence of the disturbance. The sys- tem shows better performance in terms of reduced control up- dates, ensures system stability which further guarantees optimiz- ation of resource usage and cost. The simulation results are provided for validation of proposed methodology for tracking problem by a robotic manipulator. The number of aperiodic con- trol updates is found to be approximately 44% and 61% in the presence of constant and time-varying disturbances respectively.

Introduction C ONVENTIONAL control theory is usually based on time triggered approach,i.e., periodic sampling of feedback and accomplishment of control law. This approach is well known for its simplicity of analysis. In this approach rate of control law execution does not depend upon system states. Such control approach may be inefficient from computational perspective. An alternate approach known as an event- triggered control has been presented in [1]. In event-triggered control, execution of control law is done in aperiodic manner. The control input is computed at events based on condition(s) or threshold value(s) which relies on evolution of system states. Hence, the number of data packets transmitted over network are less which in turn reduces actuator efforts. Event- triggered control makes optimal utilization of resources and improves performance in terms of processing time. Simple event-triggered control approaches have been presented in [2] [4]. Lunze et al. show state feedback based event- triggered control in [5]. Several works in distributed network control system, decentralized sensor networks, consensus con- trol with time delay on event-triggered approach can be re- ferred to [6] [14]. The works presented in [15], [16] discuss non-linear event-triggered approach. The uncertainties are unavoidable in real-time control systems. They might adversely affect the performance of system. Hence, their treatment becomes a necessary task. The current state-of-the-art primarily deals with event-triggered strategy for systems without uncertainty or some works have been reported on linear system with uncertainty [5], [12], [13]. Uncertainties in system affect the performance of event- triggered control [5]. To overcome uncertainty present in system, sliding mode control (SMC) has been used for its good performance [17] [19]. SMC can be used for continuous as well as discrete time system dynamics. For discrete time SMC, steady-state performance of system depends upon sampling time and disturbance bound [20]. Li et al. in [21] have designed an adaptive sliding-mode stabilization for Markov jump nonlinear systems with actuator faults which guarantees stochastic stability of closed loop system. These works are based on conventional time-triggered approach. Event based SMC have been presented in [13], [22] for linear system. These works do not cater to admissibility of control inputs. Admissibility in event-trigger is defined by a bound on inter execution time for update of control law which should be a finite value to ensure system stability. Ferrara and Cucuzzella [23] have shown general results for sliding mode control of first and second order using event-based approach. The paper considers triggering conditions first and then goes for stability analysis of the system in both cases. The triggering conditions are designed using threshold values which are arbitrarily set. The motivation for this work is to develop an approach which reduces usage of various resources and actuator efforts. In addition to it, a controller methodology should take care of system stability, uncertainty and admissibility of control executions. SMC has been extensively studied in recent years but to the best of our knowledge there is dearth of work which analyzes the performance of SMC for trajectory tracking by nonlinear system based on event-triggered approach. This paper puts an effort to present such a controller design by considering the dynamics of robotic manipulator and modeling it into a general nonlinear control affine system. The event-based approach performs at par to the time-triggered controller if not better.

The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents preliminaries. Section III has three subsections. The first subsection presents mathematical modeling and sliding mode control law design for trajectory tracking. The proposed event-triggered sliding mode control law is discussed in second subsection. The third subsection discusses semi-global uniform ultimate boundedness of dynamical system on desired trajectory ensuring minimum bound on inter-event time. In Section IV, results and discussions for trajectory tracking have been presented. Finally, conclusions are drawn in Section V. II. Preliminaries A nonlinear input affine system with external disturbance is considered as x = f(x)+g(x)(u+d) (1) x Rn, f : Rn Rn,u Rm,g : Rn Rn Rm d Rm d(t) ||d(t)|| dmax where x and . The external disturbance is unknown and assumed to be bounded i.e. . The dynamics of desired trajectory is xd = fd(xd). (2) x The tracking error is difference between actual and desired trajectory. x = x xd. (3) ( ) The control input depends on tracking error and desired trajectory. The control law can therefore be written as a function of , i.e., . u = ( ), = [ x xd]T. (4) The tracking error dynamics is further expressed as x = x xd, x = f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd)( ( )+d(t)) xd. (5) u ti i = 0,1,2,.... The event driven approach updates control law in an aperiodic way on the basis of triggering condition(s). An event is basically a discrete time instant when system tends to become unstable and a necessary action is to be taken to make it stable. The necessary action here is the update of control input ( ) which ensures stability of the system along with the desired trajectory tracking. The control law is updated at non- uniform time instant ( ). If the system remains stable then there will be no triggering of event and consequently there will be no update of control input. The tracking error dynamics can be expressed in terms of event- based control input as x = f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd)( ( (ti))+d(t)) xd. (6) e A parameter termed as event-trigger error ( ) is defined for developing triggering condition. e(t) = (ti) (t) e(t) = [ x(ti) x(t)xd(ti) xd(t)]T (7) t [ti,ti+1) e where . The event-trigger error ( ) is different from x = x xd x xd xd xd trajectory tracking error . The objective of defining the event-triggered error in terms of tracking error and the known desired trajectory is to design the event-triggering condition from Lyapunov stability analysis. The desired tra- jectory is known but it is time varying by nature. The dif- ference (i.e. error) between the desired value of at last trig- gering instant and current time instant contributes in deciding events based on stability of the system. Equation (6) can be further expressed as a perturbed dynamics in terms of event- trigger error. x = [f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd)( ( )+d(t)) xd] +g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )). (8) The following section provides a novel approach for design of event-triggered SMC for nonlinear input affine system with external disturbances. III. System Modeling and Control Law for Trajectory Tracking The proposed control approach has been designed by modeling the dynamics for a class of nonlinear system into a general nonlinear control affine system. The control approach can be directly applied to system which are already in affine form. A. Nonlinear Control Affine System The dynamics of a class of continuous time system is described mathematically in the following non-linear differential form [24], [25]. M(q) q+C(q, q)+G(q)+ D(t,q, q) = (t) (9) n q Rn q Rn M(q) n n C(q, q) G(q) n 1 D(t,q, q) (t) n 1 where is number of states, is position vector, is velocity vector, is inertia matrix, and are are system vector, is uncertainty term and is control vector. For controller design, the dynamic model given in (9) has to be expressed in standard nonlinear control affine form with respective states. The position and velocity vectors considered here are as follows. x1 = [q1 q2]T , x2 = [ q1 q2]T , x = [x1 x2]T . (10) The system parameters and control input are expressed as f(x) = M 1(C(q, q)+G(q))g(x) = M 1, u = . (11) Using (10) and (11), the state space model for (9) can be written in following form. x1 = x2, x2 = f(x)+g(x)(u+d(t)). (12) S (t) x1 x2 The control law designed for tracking is based on SMC. A sliding surface ( ) is defined in terms of tracking error ( and ). S (t) = x1 + x2 (13) x1 = x1 x1d x2 = x2 x2d x1d x2d where is a non-zero positive sliding gain parameter with and . and represent the states of respective desired trajectories. The derivative of sliding surface can be expressed as S (t) = x1 + x2 S (t) = x1 + x2 x2d. (14) V A Lyapunov function is defined in terms of sliding surface. 308 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA, VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 V = 1 2S (t)TS (t). (15) Using (12) and (14), the derivative of Lyapunov function defined in (15) is V = S (t)T S (t) = S (t)T[ f(x)+g(x)(u+d(t)) x2d + x1]. (16) For a non zero positive constant K, closed loop system will be stable for the control law designed as u = g(x) 1[f(x)+ K sign(S (t)) x2d + x1] (17) K > max||g( x+ xd)d(t)||+ where . is a non zero positive constant. The derivative of Lyapunov function in (16) will be- come V = S T(t)[g(x)d(t) Ksign(S (t))] = S T(t)[Ksign(S (t)) g( x+ xd)d(t)] S T sign(S (t)) |S (t)| 2 +1|| x|| 0. (18) Equation (18) proves that the sliding mode control law in (17) ensures asymptotic stability of system. Event triggered approach for SMC is discussed in following subsection. Remark 1: Note that, for the control law in (17) with a positive scalar constant , system given in (12) converges to zero and guarantees stability in presence of disturbance. Remark 2: The notion of zero dynamics of a nonlinear system is used in the investigation of three classes of problems that arise in robotics: control of robots in rigid contact with the environment, free motion control of manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom, and trajectory control of robot arms with flexible links. In each case, the internal dynamics present in the system when a proper output is constrained to be zero is characterized, and a physical interpretation of such dynamics is provided [26]. B. Event Triggered Sliding Mode Control In this subsection, design of an event-based control law and triggering conditions are discussed. The control law should meet following two aspects: 1) tracking error should converge to zero ensuring asymptotic stability of system, and 2) does not violate admissibility condition, i.e., non stacking of actuator actions. The following assumptions are considered for design of event-triggered SMC law applied to system (12) for trajectory tracking problem. V( x) : Rn R+ 0 xd Assumption 1: Consider a Lyapunov candidate function for system given in (5), such that for all 1) 1(|| x||) V 2(|| x||) 2) V x [f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd) ( ( (ti))+d(t)) xd] 3(|| x||) (19) 1( ) 2( ) 3( ) K where , and are class functions. f(.) g(.) Assumption 2: The functions and of system dynamics are assumed to be known. f( ) fd( ) g( ) ( ) Assumption 3: , , , are assumed to be Lipschitz [27] on compact sets. t 0 || x(0)|| ||xd|| h ||d(t)|| dmax 0, h 0 dmax 0 Assumption 4: , , and where, and [28]. g(x) t [ti,ti+1) g(x) Lg Assumption 5: Variation in over triggering instant i.e. the interval is negligible. is positive definite and bounded by maximum value of on compact set E [24]. f g f g f g Remark 3: The sliding mode variable, controller design, and event-triggering condition takes into account and . Hence, this work considers and to be known. The and may be considered uncertain as in [29]. g(x) g(x) Lg g(x) t [ti,ti+1) Remark 4: As per [24], a non-linear dynamical system can be modelled in state space form where represents the inverse of inertia matrix. For such a system is positive definite and bounded by maximum value of on compact set E. For the sake of simplicity, variation of during inter- events, i.e., the interval are assumed to be negligible. (.) E = [ : || x|| ;||xd|| h;||d(t)|| dmax] A Lipschitz constant, denoted as L, is defined for function on compact set . Using Assumption 2 with equation for (4), one has ||u(ti) u|| = || ( +e) ( )|| = L||e||. (20) Theorem 1: Let an event-triggered sliding mode control law for system in (12) can be designed as u(ti) = g(x(ti)) 1[f( x(ti)+ xd(ti)) + Ksign(S (ti)) x2d(ti)+ x1(ti)] (21) ti where represents a triggering instant. If the following threshold conditions 1) ||e|| 2( +1)L (22a) where e is defined in (7), 2) || x|| r for all t [ti,ti+1) (22b) wherer r is a design parameter which guarantees boundedness of tracking error are not satisfied, then an event is triggered and control input is updated. The gradual triggering of events lead tracking error to converge to zero in presence of disturb- ance and the system shows asymptotic stability. V( x) V( x) = V x x Proof: Consider a Lyapunov function as per Assumption 1 for the system described in (12). The derivative of Lyapunov function can be expressed as , which can be further expressed using perturbed dynamics in (8) as V = V x [ f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd) ( )+g( x+ xd)d(t) xd] + V x g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )). (22) Using Assumption 1, (22) can be expressed as V 3|| x||+ V x g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )). (23) Consider the second term of (23) for further analysis V x g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )). (24) The Lyapunov candidate function is explicitly defined as V( x) = 1 2( x2 + x1)T( x2 + x1). (25) MUSTAFA et al.: EVENT-TRIGGERED SLIDING MODE CONTROL FOR TRAJECTORY TRACKING OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS 309 V( x) The partial derivative of can be expressed as V x = [ 1][ x2 + x1 x2 + x1]T. (26) Using Assumption 4, g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )) = g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u). (27) ti Using (17) and (21) along with Assumption 4 at event- triggered instant , (27) can be expressed as g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u) = [ f( x+ xd)+ K sign(S ) x2d + x1] [ f( x(ti)+ xd(ti))+ K sign(S (ti)) x2d(ti)+ x1(ti)]. (28) Equation (28) can be further written using (2) as g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u) = f( x+ xd) f( x(ti)+ xd(ti))+ K sign(S ) K sign(S (ti))+ fd(x2d(ti)) fd(x2d)+ x1 x1(ti). (29) x1 = x1 x1d, x1 = x2 + x2d x1d Using and (2), (29) becomes g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u) = f( x+ xd) f( x(ti)+ xd(ti)) + K sign(S ) K sign(S (ti))+ fd(x2d(ti)) fd(x2d)+ ( x2 x2i)+ (x2d x2d(ti))+ ( fd(x1d(ti)) fd(x1d)). (30) f( ) fd( ) As per Assumption 2, and are assumed to be Lipschitz for a defined set. Hence, g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u) f( x+ xd) f( x(ti)+ xd(ti)) + K sign(S ) K sign(S (ti)) + fd(x2d(ti)) fd(x2d) + ( x2 x2(ti)) + (x2d x2d(ti)) + ( fd(x1d(ti)) fd(x1d)) . (31) Equation (31) is further expressed as g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u) L1( x+ xd x(ti) xd(ti)) + L2(x2d(ti) x2d) + ( x2 x2(ti)) + (x2d x2d(ti)) + L3(x1d(ti) x1d) . (32) e Equation (32) is written below in terms of event-trigger error . g( x+ xd)y(u(ti) u) L1 [1 1 1 1]e + L2 [0 0 0 1]e + [0 1 0 1]e + L3 [0 0 1 0]e (33) e where event-trigger error ( ) is given in (22a). Equation (33) is further expressed as g( x+ xd)(u(ti) u) 2L1 e + L2 e + L3 e + 2 e . (34) Using (26) and (34), equation (24) can be written as V x g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )) ( +1) ( 2 +1)|| x||L||e|| (35) where L = 2L1 + L2 + L3 + 2 . (36) Using (18) and (35), equation (22) can be further written as V = V x [ f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd) ( )+d(t) xd] + V x g( x+ xd)( ( +e) ( )) (37) which will finally become V 2 +1|| x||+( +1) ( 2 +1)|| x||L||e||. (38) V 0 Using the event-trigger threshold condition (22a) in (38), one can ensure . It shows that the system in (12) with the designed control law in (21) is bounded and achieves convergence despite the disturbance. The violation of threshold conditions (22a) and (22b) are necessary as well as sufficient for the update of event-driven sliding mode control. This completes the proof of Theorem 1. Remark 5: Theorem 1 shows that control law in (21) will force the system to track the desired trajectory in presence of disturbance rendering asymptotic stability of the system. The proof ensures this approach can be applied to real-time applications with resource optimization. C. Admissibility of Event-Driven Control The admissibility of event-driven control law is necessary to avoid the piling of triggering instants and ensuring the stability of system. Theorem 2 provides a lower bound for an inter-event triggering interval. Definition 1: Admissibility in event-triggered system is defined as the inter-execution time for update of control law which is always lower bounded by a finite value. v = f(t,v), v(t0) = v0 f(t,v) v t t 0 v W R. [t0,T) v(t) v(t) W t [t0,T) m(t) D+m(t) D+m(t) f(t,m(t)), m(t0) m0 m(t) W t [t0,T) m(t) v(t) t [t0,T) Lemma 1 (Comparison Lemma) [27]: Let the scalar differential equation , where is locally Lipschitz in and continuous in , and Consider be maximal period of solution , and assume that . Consider be a continous function whose upper derivative on right-hand satisfy differential inequality with . Then, for all . ti (i = 0,1,2...) Ti Ti = ti+1 ti Theorem 2: For the system in (12), event-driven control is updated on violation of conditions in (22a) and (22b) . For admissibility of system the inter-event period defined as should always be lower bounded by a positive constant given by Ti 1 Q ( 1+ 2( +1)L( +h+dmax) ) . (39) e Proof: The time required for event-trigger error to rise from zero at last triggerng instant to threshold value should be lower bounded. Hence, the accumulation of triggering instants and existence of Zeno phenomenon can be avoided ensuring a stable system. The event driven system is represented as x = f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd)( ( )+d(t)) xd. (40) Using triangular inequality, (40) can be expressed as || x|| || f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd)( ( )+d(t)) xd|| +||g( x+ xd)[ ( +e) ( )]||. (41) f( x+ xd)+g( x+ xd)( ( )+d(t)) xd La For , a Lipschitz constant is defined on compact set E based on Assumptions 2 and 3.

Hence, equation (42) can be expressed as || x|| La(|| x||+||xd||+||d(t)||)+ LgL e . (43) Q (Q > 0) || x|| Q (|| x||+||xd||+||d(t)||+||e||) t [ti,ti+1) There exists a constant such that .

(45) Then, using Lemma 1 ||e|| ( +h+dmax)(expQ(t ti) 1), t (ti,ti+1). (46) Using (22a) in (46) the lower bound on inter-event time is obtained as Ti 1 Q ( 1+ 2( +1)L( +h+dmax) ) . (47) Remark 6: Theorem 2 shows that the inter-execution time in (47) for the designed control law (21) will be lower bounded. The boundedness on inter-execution time will ensure non- accumulation of actuator actions and further guarantees robust trajectory tracking. This proof supports the real-time feasibility of developed resource optimization approach. L L j(j = 1,2,a,...)

Results and Discussions This section validates the proposed event-triggered sliding mode controller for trajectory tracking problem. Simulations are carried out for two-link robotic manipulator.

Lumped Coriolis and Gravitational force is represented by and for joints-1 and 2 respectively. and represent disturb- ances and and are torques for joints-1 and 2, respect- ively. The structural parameters of robotic manipulator are: = 1 kg, = 1 kg, = 1 m and m. ( ) and ( ) are mass and length of links respectively.The desired trajectories for two joints are = [ . The initial joint positions are = . The Lipschitz con- stant L is determined using (36) as 0.85. The sliding mode gain parameter in (13) is considered to be unity. Consider the design parameter = 0.7 and bound on tracking error r = 1.2. The sampling period considered is 0.01s. The results have been obtained for constant as well as time-varying disturb- ances in the system. The initial results are for constant disturb- ance of . The trajectory tracking by rigid re- volute joint robot manipulator system here does not belong to any of the cases mentioned in Remark 2. There does not exist any zero dynamics for the system considered. The desired tra- jectory tracking in terms of joints angular positions and velo- cities have been shown in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively. The tracking in these figures are robust even in the presence of un- certainty using the proposed approach. Figs. 3 and 4 demon- strate tracking error of angular positions and velocities of both joints respectively. Both tracking errors show convergence and ensure asymptotic stability of the system. The event- triggered approach binds chattering in a band as shown in tracking error plots. The event-based sliding mode control in- put for both joints have been shown in Fig. 5. The control in- puts demonstrate aperiodic triggering after 6 s. They are not updated periodically and remain constant for many inter-event intervals. Fig. 6 shows the sliding surface of both joints. Al- though Fig. 6 illustrates chattering on sliding surfaces, the control law brings trajectory to sliding manifold and ensures system stability. Fig. 7 presents event-trigger error and tra- jectory tracking error . Both the errors converge almost to zero after 6.4 s. The time required for convergence while peri- odic-triggering is found to be approximately 6 s. The pro- posed approach takes a little more time for convergence as compared to periodic triggering but the difference is very small. It can be inferred from Figs. 7 and 8 that update of con- trol law occurs only when the conditions (22a) and (22b) are violated. Fig. 7 has been enlarged in Fig. 8 for clarity in presenting all the error parameters with triggering instants after 6.4 s. It shows that aperiodic updates of control actions significantly reduce for desired tracking. These results ensure resource optimization along with stability of system. The value of Lyapunov function has been shown in Fig. 9. MUSTAFA et al.: EVENT-TRIGGERED SLIDING MODE CONTROL FOR TRAJECTORY TRACKING OF NONLINEAR SYSTEMS 311 The number of control updates using the proposed approach are found to be 441 for the simulated duration of 10 s (i.e., 1000 sampling instants). The average frequency of control up- dates is approximately 44 Hz. Similarly the number of control updates for time varying disturbance d(t) = [0.5sin(3.14t) 0.5sin(3.14t)] T are found to be 606 for the simulated dura- tion of 10 s (i.e. 1000 sampling instants). The average fre- quency of control updates is approximately 61 Hz. The angu- lar positions and tracking errors of joints for second set of res- ults have been shown in Figs. 10 and 11 respectively. The nor- malized values of various error parameters have been shown in Fig. 12 with its zoomed view in Fig. 13 along with the trig- gering instants. A comparison of time-triggered and proposed SMC controller has been done in Table I based on number of events and convergence time of errors.

Conclusions The work in this paper presented the event-driven sliding mode control for tracking problem of a class of nonlinear input affine system in the presence of the uncertainty. The proposed approach guarantees asymptotic stability for the desired trajectory. It also ensures boundedness of error and avoids Zeno behavior on the sliding surfaces. Inter-execution time for proposed control approach is verified through simulation results. The presented work shows performance of the system at par with traditional periodic triggering approach in the terms of processing time. The proposed approach also significantly reduces the number of actuator actions required to address trajectory tracking problem. This ensures optimization of resources available for any system operation. The approach can be restrictive to some critical applications where high threshold error and chattering cannot be tolerated. This approach can be extended to multi-agent systems in the presence of disturbance and can be implemented on real-time framework in future. References K. E.
