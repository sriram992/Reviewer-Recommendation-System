The albino male wistar rats were divided into five different groups with six animals in each group. Group I serves as a control group, group II were given isoproterenol (85 mg/kg s.c) for 2 days while Group III was treated with metoprolol (10 mg/kg) for 30 days and isoproterinol on last 2 days. This group serves as standard group and its effect was compared with that of test drug (Nelumbo nucifera extract). Group IV and V were given Nelumbo nucifera rhizomes extract (300 mg/kg and 150 mg/kg respectively) for 30 days and isoproterinol on 29th and 30th day. The level of enzymes Aspartate transferase (AST), Alanine transferase (ALT), Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), Cretinine kinase (CK) were estimated in serum and the extent of necrosis was studied by grading. Isoproterenol significantly increased the activities of AST, ALT, CK, LDH in serum. Pretreatment with the ethanolic extract of Nelumbo nucifera had a significant decrease in the level of marker enzymes. The effect was compared with the effect on serum marker enzymes in the group treated with Metaprolol. The metaprolol treated group has shown reduced level of marker enzymes, nearer to the control group. It was found to be more protective at dose 300mg/kg as compared to 150 mg/kg dose.

Among these, the ischemic heart diseases, acute myocardial necrosis in particular, is one of the most alarming values. AMI give rise to a lot of unfavorable biochemical outcomes. The end results of which is the ultimate morbidity of patient or even death. [1]Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the principal cause of death in both developed and developing countries, accounting for roughly 20% of all worldwide deaths per year. In addition, hypertension, arrhythmia, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac failure represent the leading killer of males over the age of 45 and females over the age of 65 in the United States and accounts for 750,000 deaths annually. [2] MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION Myocardial infarction or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack is the interruption of blood supply to a part of the heart, causing heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion of Navneet Kumar Verma et al J. Chem. Pharm. Res., 2015, 7(6):627-642 ______________________________________________________________________________ 628 a coronary artery following the rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable collection of lipids and white blood cells (especially macrophages) in the wall of an artery. The resulting ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and oxygen shortage, if left untreated for a sufficient period of time, can cause damage or death (infarction) of heart muscle tissue. THE HEART The heart is a muscular organ that provides a continuous blood circulation through the cardiac cycle and is one of the most vital organs in the human body. The heart is divided into four main chambers: the two upper chambers are called the left and right atria and two lower chambers are called the right and left ventricles. There is a thick wall of muscle separating the right side and the left side of the heart called the septum. Normally with each beat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs that the left ventricle pumps out into the body. Physicians commonly refer tothe right atrium and right ventricle together as the right heart and to the left atrium and ventricle as the left heart.[3] The Heart Wall The heart is composed of cardiac muscle which enables the heart to contract and allow the synchronization of the heart beat.It is enclosed in a double-walled protective sac called the pericardium. The superficial part of this sac is called the fibrous pericardium. The fibrous pericardial sac is itself lined with the outer layer of the serous pericardium (known as the parietal pericardium). This composite (fibrous-parietal-pericardial) sac protects the heart, anchors its surrounding structures, and prevents overfilling of the heart with blood. The inner layer also provides a smooth lubricated sliding surface within which the heart organ can move in response to its own contractions and to movement of adjacent structures such as the diaphragm and lungs. [4] The heart wall is divided into three layers: Epicardium - outer protective layer of the heart. Myocardium - muscular middle layer wall of the heart. Endocardium-inner layer of the heart that is continuous with the inner lining of blood vessels. [3] EXPERIMENTAL SECTION Material Collection and authentication of plant material: The rhizome of Nelumbo nucifera was purchased from the local market and authenticated from a botanist of National Botanical Research Institute Lucknow, Ref. no: NBRI/CIF/215/2011.(Appendix III) Prepration of Nelumbo nucifera extract: The shade dried and coarse powdered material of Nelumbo nucifera rhizome was extracted exhaustively with ethanol (80%)v/v and water in a Soxhlet apparatus. 5 gram of powdered drug was soaked in 50 ml of 80% ethanol in Soxhalet apparatus. The extract was concentrated at 40 C to obtain dark brownish syrupy residue. The yield obtained from the above process was found to be 8% w/w. The extracts were preserved in a refrigerator at 4 C. Standard drug Metoprolol Metoprolol is a relatively 1-selective beta-blocker used extensively to treat hypertension and angina and as a prophylaxis after myocardial infarction. It is of similar potency to propranolol in blocking the cardiac 1 receptor. It is 1/50 times as potent as propranolol in inhibiting the vasodilator response to isoprenaline. However, it is much less active in blocking the 2 receptors in bronchii and blood vessels, hence causes less bronchial constriction. It is extensively metabolized in liver.

METHOD ISOPRENALINE INDUCED MODEL FOR MYOCARDIAL NECROSIS The model of isoprenaline-induced myocardial necrosis is considered as one of the most widely used experimental model to study the beneficial effects of many drugs and cardiac function. The pathophysiological changes following ISO administration are comparable to those taking place in human myocardial ischemia/infarction .It is also well known to generate free radicals and to stimulate lipid peroxidation, which may be a causative factor for irreversible damage to the myocardial membrane. Increases in the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during ischemia/reperfusion and the adverse effects of oxyradicals on myocardium have now been well established by both direct and indirect measurements. Thus, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS)may be a unifying mechanism in ischemic injury progression, and anti-oxidants may be the therapeutic value in this setting. Rats receiving subcutaneous injections of Isoproterenol on two consecutive days will develop myocardial necrosis. This depends on the size of the dose and the weight of the animal. The observation to develop a pharmacologic technique for producing myocardial necrosis of standard severity in animals. The myocardial necrosis was thought to result from a relative ischemia of the heart muscle. It was postulated that this was due to a combination of increased cardiac oxygen requirement as a result of the cardiac stimulant effect of the drug and a reduction of coronary blood flow secondary to a decrease in the systemic blood pressure.[6] Navneet Kumar Verma et al J. Chem. Pharm. Res., 2015, 7(6):627-642 ______________________________________________________________________________ 630 Isoproterenol Isoproterenol (ISO) is a -adrenergic agonist that causes severe stress in myocardium resulting in the infarct like necrosis of heart muscle [7]. Some of the mechanisms proposed to explain ISO induced damage in cardiac myocytes include hypoxia due to myocardial hyperactivity, coronary hypotension, calcium overload, depletion of energy reserves and excessive production of free radicals due to oxidative metabolism of catecholamines. ISO induced MN in rats is a widely used experimental model for evaluation of cardioprotective effect of various herbal drugs, because pathophysiological changes following ISO administration in rats are comparable to those taking place during MI in humans [8]. Preparation of solution for oral dose of rats The ethanolic extract of Nelumbo nucifera was accurately weighed according to oral dose of 300mg / kg, and 150 mg /kg. The solution was prepared daily by dissolving it into 0.9% normal saline. Preparation of Isoprenaline Hydrochloride solution Isoprenaline Hydrochloride (85mg /kg) was dissolved in 0.9% normal saline and freshly prepare solution was used for inducing necrosis in rat heart. Table 2; Treatment protocol Groups Number of animals Treatment to be given I 6 Normal control rats treated with normal saline II 6 Rats treated with Isoprenaline (85mg/kg/day, subcutaneous) III 6 Rats pretreated with standard drug metaprolol (metolor -50) (10 mg/kg day, oral ) And ISO (85 mg/kg/day for 2 days, subcutaneous.) IV 6 Rats pretreated with Nelumbo nucifera extract (150 mg/ kg day, oral.) and ISO (85 mg/ kg day; for 2 days, subcutaneous.) V 6 Rats pretreated with Nelumbo nucifera (300 mg/kg day oral) and ISO (85 mg kg day; for 2 days, subcutaneous.) At the end of the 29 days of pretreatment with test drug rats were weighed and Isoprenaline Hydrochloride injection was administered at the dose of ISO (85 mg/ kg/day, s.c.) twice at an interval of 24 hours (i.e., on 29th and 30th day of extract treatment). The rats were sacrificed on day 31stblood was collected by cardiac puncture by using a 2ml syringe under light ether anesthesia and allowed to clot for 30minutes at room temperature. The serum was separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm at 30 C for 15 minutes and used for the estimation of marker enzymes, including aspartate aminotransferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatine phosphokinase (CPK). The hearts were dissected out immediately, chilled, and perfuse with Ice-cold saline. The animals were sacrificed 24 hr after the second dose of isoproterenol. The heart was dissected and immediately washed in ice cold saline. The hearts were stored in 10% formaline solution for histopathological analysis. Biological Screening: The serum was separated by centrifugation using the centrifuge machine and the different serum marker enzymes were assayed. The following enzymes were estimated (i) Aspartate Transaminase (AST) (Appendix II, method 1) (ii) Alanine Transaminase (ALT) (Appendix II, method 2) (iii) Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) (Appendix II, method 3) (iv) Creatinine (Appendix III, method 4) GROSS EXAMINATION OF RAT HEART Table 3; Grade-0 No lesion.

APPENDIX IIAST (GOT) Modified UV (IFCC), Kinetic Assay Assay Principle Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) catalyses the transamination of L-aspartate and -ketogluterate to form oxaloacetate and l-glutamate. In subsequent reaction, Malate Dehydrogense (MDH) reduces oxaloacetate to malate with simultaneous oxidation of nicotinammide adenine dinucleotide (reduced) (NADH) to nicotinammide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). The rate of oxidation of NADH is measured kinetically by monitoring the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm and is directly proportional to AST activity in the sample.

H 7) Fig.6; Showing heart of various groups and high dose The grading was done on the visual basis of heart. The grade helps in comparing the condition of heart of different groups. Grading was done by numbers i.e., 0,1,2,3 & 4. The grade was decided after seeing the hearts very carefully as the necrosis increases the grade also increases, grade 0 shows no necrosis while grade 4 shows maximum necrosis. Grading Parameters Grade 0 = No Lesion Grade 1 = Inflammation, redness of heart, capillary dilations. Grade 2 = Yellowish ventricle portion, scar formation. Navneet Kumar Verma et al J. Chem. Pharm. Res., 2015, 7(6):627-642 ______________________________________________________________________________ 642 Grade 3 = Atrium & ventricle turns yellow, Grade 4 = Diffuse Heart, absolute scar formation, increased necrosis portion. Observation 1 (150mg/kg) Figure H 1: No lesions. Grade 0 Figure H 2: Diffuse heart, formation of scar, yellowness in maximum part. Grade 4 Figure H 3: Redness present, no scar formation, some yellowish portion. Grade 2 Figure H 4: Redness present, little scar formation capillary dilation and small yellowish portion. Grade 3 Observation 2 (300mg/kg) Figure H 5: No lesions. Grade 0 Figure H 6: Diffuse heart, formation of scar, complete yellowness. Grade 4 Figure H 7: Redness present, no scar formation, some yellowish portion. Grade 2 Figure H 8: Redness present, smaller yellowish portion. Grade 1 DISCUSSION Myocardium contains an abundant concentration of enzymes like creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate Transaminase. These Enzymes serves as sensitive index to assess the severity of myocardial infarction. The increase in activities of these enzymes in serum could be due to leakage of enzymes from heart. This is because of lipid peroxidation of membrane bound polyunsaturated fatty acids leading to impairment of structural and functional integrity of cardiac cell membrane as result of sequence of biochemical alteration such as increased calcium overload, activation of ATPase, phospolipase, degradation of phospholipids, by free radicals generated by isoproterinol. This increase in the serum enzyme level of creatinine kinase, lactate dehydrogenase, Alanine Transaminase, Aspartate Transaminase strongly suggest about the myocardial necrosis. Ethanolic extract of Nelumbo nucifera (150mg/kg & 300 mg/kg p.o once daily) pretreated-ISO administered rats maintains the levels of AST, ALT, CK, and LDH near to normal. This data suggested that N. N. is effective cardioprotective effect at the dose of 150mg/kg & 300mg/kg p.o. once daily) REFERENCES [1] Upaganlwar A., Gandhi H., balraman R., journal of pharmacology and toxicology, 2011, 6 (1): 1-17.
