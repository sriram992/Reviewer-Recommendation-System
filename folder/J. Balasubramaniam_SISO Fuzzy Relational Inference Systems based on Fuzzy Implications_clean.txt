SISO Fuzzy Relational Inference Systems based on Fuzzy Implications are Universal Approximators Sayantan Mandal and Balasubramaniam Jayaram, Department of Mathematics, Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh - 502 205, India Email: {ma10p002, jbala}@iith.ac.in Abstract In this work, we show that single input single output (SISO) fuzzy inference systems based on Fuzzy Relational Inference (FRI) with implicative interpretation of the rule base are universal approximators under suitable choice of operations for the other components of the fuzzy system. The presented proofs make no assumption on the form or representations of the considered fuzzy implications and hence show that a much larger class of fuzzy implications other than what is typically considered in the literature can be employed meaningfully in FRIs based on implicative models. A concept of Weak Coherence is proposed, which plays an important role in enlarging the class of fuzzy implications that can be considered. Keywords: Fuzzy Relational Inference, Fuzzy Implications, Universal Approximation 1. Introduction The term approximate reasoning refers to methods and methodologies that enable reasoning with im- precise inputs to obtain meaningful outputs [15]. Fuzzy Inference Systems (FIS) form one particular type of approximate reasoning scheme involving fuzzy sets and are one of the best known applications of fuzzy logic in the wider sense. FIS have many degrees of freedom, namely, the underlying fuzzy partition of the input and output spaces, the fuzzy logic operations employed, the fuzzi cation and defuzzi cation proce- dures used, etc. This freedom gives rise to a variety of FIS with di ering capabilities. The best known types of FIS are the Fuzzy Relational Inference (FRI) systems [28, 45], Similarity Based Reasoning (SBR) systems [24, 34, 13, 20] and the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy systems [31, 32]. In this work, we focus only on the FRI systems. 1.1. Motivation for this work One of the important factors considered while employing an FIS is its approximation capability. While many studies have appeared on this topic, most of them deal with FRIs where the rules are interpreted in a non-conditional way or as just aggregation of possibile con gurations of the data (see Section 3 for details). When an implicative or a conditional interpretation of the rules is considered, there are only a few works that deal with their approximation properties. While one of the earliest studies on this topic was that of Castro [10], [11], it was later on shown by Li et al. [23], [22] that some of the operations considered by Castro led to vacuous outputs. Li et al. further went on to present their own results on it. However, the scope of their work is restricted to the following three families of fuzzy implications, namely, R-implications from left-continuous t-norms, (S, N)- Preprint submitted to Fuzzy Sets and Systems and QL-implications. Recently, St epni cka et al. [39] have discussed the same in a slightly more general setting. Once again, the assumptions they make on some components of the FRIs are not desirable - for instance, the requirements on the input partition make it non-Ruspini. Thus there is a need for constructing an implicative FRI based FIS that is both a universal approximator and whose components have some desirable properties. Further, so far, all the studies have largely considered fuzzy implications obtained as the residuals of left- continuous t-norms, while Li et al. [23] had considered also the families of (S, N)- and QL-implications.Thus a study of approximation capabilities of FRIs based on fuzzy implications that come from a more general class of fuzzy implications is important. 1.2. Main contributions of the work In this work, we provide a constructive proof of the universal approximation property of FRIs when an implicative model of the rule base is employed, i.e., where the operation between the antecedents and consequents is taken as a fuzzy implication. The proof makes no assumption on the form or representation of the considered fuzzy implications and hence is applicable for a much larger class of fuzzy implications other than what is typically considered in the literature. Especially, the presented proofs are applicable also to contexts where implications that come from a non-residuated lattice setting are employed. Further we have shown that the approximator function is continuous which is an important issue as discussed in [37]. 1.3. Outline of the work After presenting some important de nitions from both fuzzy set theory and fuzzy logic connectives in Section 2, we describe the two main types of fuzzy rule bases used in fuzzy systems in Section 3. Following this, Section 4 is devoted to a full description of fuzzy relational inference (FRI) mechanisms. In Section 5 we present a short survey on the works and results related to universal approximation of fuzzy relational inference systems. Further we clearly specify the main contributions and scope of our work. Relaxing the often insisted coherence of an implicative model suitably to the context of function approx- imation, Section 6 investigates the class of fuzzy implications that can be used in FRIs to ensure this form of weak coherence. This section also presents some well-known families of fuzzy implications that belong to the above admissible class of fuzzy implications. Finally, Sections 7 and 8 contain the major contributions of this work, which show that FRIs employing a rather large class of fuzzy implications - which include the R-implications - are universal approximators. Section 9 presents some examples that illustrate the investigations and analysis of the previous sections. In Section 10 some concluding remarks are given. 2. Preliminaries We assume that the reader is familiar with the classical results concerning fuzzy set theory and basic fuzzy logic connectives, but to make this work more self-contained, we introduce some notations, concepts and results employed in the rest of the work. In this work we only consider X R to be a closed and bounded interval and hence X is totally ordered, linear and compact w.r.to the usual topology on R. However, many of the concepts below are applicable to more general sets and hence the de nition is given accordingly. 2.1. Fuzzy Sets De nition 2.1. If X is a non-empty set then F(X) is the fuzzy power set of X, i.e., F(X) = {A|A : X [0, 1]}. De nition 2.2. A fuzzy set A is said to be normal if there exists an x X such that A(x) = 1, 2 convex if X is a compact subset of a linear space and for any [0, 1], x, y X, A( x + (1 )y) min{A(x), A(y)}. De nition 2.3. For an A F(X), the Support, Height, Kernel and Ceiling of A are denoted, respectively, as Supp A, Hgt A, Ker A and Ceil A and are de ned as: Supp A = {x X|A(x) > 0} , Hgt A = sup{A(x)|x X} , Ker A = {x X|A(x) = 1} , Ceil A = {x X|A(x) = Hgt A} . A is said to be bounded if Supp A is a bounded set. Note that for a normal fuzzy set Ker A = Ceil A and Hgt A = 1. De nition 2.4. Let P be a nite collection of fuzzy sets of X, i.e, P = {Ak}n k=1 F(X). P is said to form a fuzzy partition on X if X n [ k=1 Supp Ak . In the literature, a partition P of X as de ned above is also called a complete partition. Note that there are several other approaches to and de nitions of a fuzzy partition, see for instance, [9, 14, 18, 26, 27] De nition 2.5. A fuzzy partition P = {Ak}n k=1 F(X) is said to be consistent if whenever for some k, Ak(x) = 1 then Aj(x) = 0 for j = k, a Ruspini Partition if n X k=1 Ak(x) = 1 for every x X. (1) 2.2. Defuzzi cation Often there is a need to convert a fuzzy set to a crisp value, a process which is called Defuzzi cation. This process of defuzzi cation can be seen as a mapping d : F(X) X. There are many types of defuzzi cation techniques available in the literature, see [30] for a good overview. The defuzzi er given in Example 2.6 will be used extensively in the sequel. Example 2.6. For a fuzzy set A F(X), with bounded Ceil A, the Mean of Maxima ( MOM) defuzzi- er gives as output the mean of all those values in X with the highest membership value, which can be mathematically expressed as MOM(A) = Z Ceil A xdx Z Ceil A 1dx , if Z Ceil A 1dx = 0. (2) 2.3. Fuzzy Logic Connectives Note that in this work, we use the term decreasing and increasing in a non-strict sense. In other words, we call a function t1 : R R decreasing or non-increasing if t1(x) t1(y) whenever x y. Similarly, we call a function t2 : R R increasing or non-decreasing if t2(x) t2(y) whenever x y. De nition 2.7 ([21]). A binary operation T : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a t-norm, if it is increasing in both variables, commutative, associative and has 1 as the neutral element. 3 De nition 2.8 ([21]). A t-norm T is called positive if T(x, y) = 0 then either x = 0 or y = 0. De nition 2.9 ( [2], De nition 1.1.1). A function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a fuzzy implication if it satis es, for all x, x1, x2, y, y1, y2 [0, 1], the following conditions: if x1 x2, then I(x1, y) I(x2, y) , i.e., I( , y) is decreasing , if y1 y2, then I(x, y1) I(x, y2) , i.e., I(x, ) is increasing , I(0, 0) = 1 , I(1, 1) = 1 , I(1, 0) = 0 . The set of all fuzzy implications will be denoted by I. De nition 2.10 ([2]). A fuzzy implication I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is said to satisfy the left neutrality property, if I(1, y) = y , y [0, 1] , (NP) satisfy the ordering property, if I(x, y) = 1 x y , x, y [0, 1] . (OP) be a positive fuzzy implication if I(x, y) > 0, for all x, y (0, 1]. For examples of such fuzzy implications, please refer to Table 1. De nition 2.11 ([2]). A function N : [0, 1] [0, 1] is called a fuzzy negation if N(0) = 1, N(1) = 0 and N is decreasing. Example 2.12. One such fuzzy negation is the G odel negation ND1(x) = ( 1, if x = 0 , 0, if x > 0 , x [0, 1] . (3) De nition 2.13 ([2]). Let I I be any fuzzy implication. The function NI : [0, 1] [0, 1] de ned by NI(x) = I(x, 0) is a fuzzy negation and is called the natural negation of I. We denote the class of fuzzy implications that satisfy (OP) by IOP I and the class of fuzzy implications that are positive and whose natural negation NI = ND1 by I + ND1 I. 3. Fuzzy IF-THEN Rule Base Given two non-empty crisp sets X, Y R, a Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) fuzzy IF-THEN rulebase consists of rules of the form: IF x is Ai THEN y is Bi , (4) where x, y are the linguistic variables and Ai, Bi, i = 1, 2, . . . n are the linguistic values taken by the linguistic variables. These linguistic values are represented by fuzzy sets in their corresponding domains, i.e., Ai F(X), Bi F(Y ). As an example, IF Temperature is High THEN Fanspeed is Medium. Here Temperature and Fanspeed are the linguistic variables and High, Medium are the linguistic values taken by the linguistic variables in a suitable domain. 4 A fuzzy rule base (4) can be viewed in two di erent ways, as explained in [16],[17]. When each of the rules is viewed as a constraint, i.e., when the rules in (4) are combined together as IF x is A1 THEN y is B1, . . . AND . . . IF x is An THEN y is Bn, (5) we have the conditional form (IF-THEN) of the rules. On the other hand, each of the rules can also be viewed as just pieces of data giving possible con gurations or positive information, in which case they are combined as follows: x is A1 AND y is B1, . . . OR . . . x is An AND y is Bn. (6) 3.1. Fuzzy Relations that model the Rule Base (5) and (6) In fuzzy relational inference mechanisms (see Section 4 below), fuzzy relations R : X Y [0, 1] are employed to represent the rule base (5) and (6). Two of the commonly employed fuzzy relations are the following: For any x X, y Y , R (x, y) = n ^ i=1 (Ai(x) Bi(y)) , (7) R (x, y) = n _ i=1 (Ai(x) Bi(y)) , (8) where is taken as a fuzzy implication and as a t-norm. Note that the fuzzy relation R captures the conditional form (5) of the given rules, while the relation R captures the Cartesian product form (6) of the rules. For more on the semantics of R and R we refer the readers to [17]. 4. Fuzzy Relational Inference mechanism Given a rule base of the form (5) or (6) and an input x is A , the main objective of a fuzzy inference mechanism is to nd a meaningful B such that y is B . While many types of fuzzy inference mechanisms have been proposed in the literature we restrict this study only to fuzzy relation based inference mechanisms. The inference mechanism in a fuzzy relational inference (FRI) can be expressed as follows: B = f @ R (A ) = A @R, (FRI-R) where A F(X) is the input, the relation R F(X Y ) represents or models the rule base, B F(Y ) is the obtained output and @ is called the composition operator, which is a mapping @: F(X) F(X Y ) F(Y ). 5 4.1. Two main types of FRIs One of the two main FRIs is the Compositional Rule of Inference (CRI) proposed by Zadeh [44] and given as: B (y) = f R(A )(y) = _ x X [A (x) R(x, y)], y Y, (CRI-R) where is a t-norm. The operator is also known as the sup T composition where T is a t-norm. Later Pedrycz [28] proposed another FRI mechanism based on the Bandler-Kohout Subproduct composition given as: B (y) = f R(A )(y) = ^ x X [A (x) R(x, y)], y Y, (BKS-R) with interpreted as a fuzzy implication. The operator is also known as the inf I composition where I is a fuzzy implication. Note that f R(A ) is also known as the direct image of A over R, while f R(A ) is called the sub-direct image of A over R [39]. 4.2. FRI with Singleton input Since we deal with universal approximation capability, the inputs are crisp and hence we need to suitably fuzzify the crisp input to a fuzzy input. If x0 X is a crisp input, then it is suitably fuzzi ed, i.e., a fuzzy set A F(X) is suitably constructed from x0. Commonly, the following singleton fuzzi er is employed: A (x) = ( 1, x = x0 , 0, x = x0 . With the above input A , the FRI mechanism (FRI-R) reduces to B (y) = R(x0, y), y Y, (FRI-R-Singleton) for any t-norm in case of (CRI-R) and any implication I satisfying (NP) in case of (BKS-R). Thus in the case of a singleton input both the (CRI-R) and (BKS-R) are essentially the same (provided in (BKS-R) satis es (NP) ) and the output is fully dependent on the model of the rule base R. In other words, f R f R and hence the composition or - when the I in = inf I composition satis es (NP) - does not play any role. 4.3. Scope of this work We denote an FRI with singleton input as a quadruple F =  PX, PY , R, d  , where PX = {Ai} and PY = {Bi} correspond to the input and output fuzzy partitions on X and Y , respectively, R is the fuzzy relation modeling the rule base and d is the defuzzi er used to obtain a crisp output from the obtained B in (FRI-R-Singleton). Thus given an F the overall inference can be seen as a function g : X Y as follows: g(x ) = d(B ( )) = d(R(x , )) , x X. (9) In the literature, g is also known as the system function of a given F, see for instance, [22, 23]. In this paper we deal only with the implicative form of the rule base, i.e., the antecedents of the rules are related to their consequents using a fuzzy implication and hence x R = R in the sequel. Further, we consider the following generalised form of R , where T is any t-norm, not necessarily the minimum t-norm: RT (x, y) = T n i=1(Ai(x) Bi(y)), (Imp-RT ) Thus this work deals with FRIs of the form FT =  PX, PY , RT , d  F. 6 5. FRIs as Universal Approximators 5.1. Universal Approximation results with FRI In this subsection, we only brie y recall some of the important works dealing with the approximation properties of FRIs and refer the readers to the excellent review of Tikk et al. [33] for more details and the other recent works, for instance [29], [43] and the references therein. The earliest works to appear on this topic dealt with FRIs where R = R and hence can be considered to have assumed a Cartesian product interpretation of the fuzzy rules, see Wang [41] and Zeng & Singh [46]. It was Castro [10] who was the rst to deal with the approximation properties of FRIs that employed R . However, as was already pointed out by Li et al. Remark 2.4, [23], Castro has considered an FRI as given below: B (y) = _ j (B j(y)) = _ j (Aj(x0) Bj(y)) , which is clearly not an appropriate model to work with, since under most practical settings for any given x0 X there will always exist a rule with an antecedent Ai0 such that Ai0(x0) = 0 and since 0 b = 1 for any b [0, 1], when the maximum t-conorm is used to aggregate the individual outputs one always obtains that B (y) = 1 for all y Y . Note that this is the case when the input partitions are of the Ruspini type - a property that is normally both practical and desirable. In the same work, after pointing out the above, Li et al. (see Theorem 3.4, [23]) have given a constructive proof of the approximation capability of an FRI with R = R . However, the scope of their work is restricted to the following three families of fuzzy implications, namely, R-implications from left-continuous t-norms, (S, N)- and QL-implications. Further, many of the results are without complete and correct proofs, thus making a deeper understanding of the approach di cult. Per lieva and Kreinovich [29] have discussed approximation capability of fuzzy systems that re ect the CNF-DNF duality. However, the considered / constructed partitions are not fuzzy and hence the constructed rule base contains antecedents and consequents that are crisp sets. Further, they make an implicit assumption that the considered implications can be written as a generalization of the classical material implication, which in the context of fuzzy logic connectives is equivalent to assuming that the considered implication is an (S, N)-implication. While this assumption is valid in their context, since the relations RCNF are crisp and hence only need to deal with {0, 1} values, in general, this is not true when we consider truth-values over the entire [0, 1] interval. Recently, St epni cka et al. in [39] considered an FRI with R = R where is the Lukasiewicz t-norm TLK(x, y) = max(0, x + y 1) and is any residuated implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm , which can be di erent from TLK. They have shown that the FRIs F = FTLK =  PX, PY , RTLK , MOM  are universal approximators. Their result is true for any continuous function f but the Ai s do not form a Ruspini partition which is normal and desirable in practical settings. 5.2. Main contribution of this work In this work, we show that FRIs of the form FT =  PX, PY , RT , d  are universal approximators. Moreover it has also been shown that the system function g of the given FT is continuous. A concept of weak coherence is proposed, which plays an important role in enlarging the class of fuzzy implications that can be considered. The proof is general enough for a large class of fuzzy implications and is valid for any continuous function, not necessarily monotonic and the partitions used are of the Ruspini type. Thus, we believe that these results are very much applicable in most of the practical and desirable contexts [17, 39, 40]. 6. Weak Coherence and Implicative Models 6.1. A Weaker form of Coherence Dubois et al. [17] de ned the concept of coherence for an implicative model R ( see (7)) of a rule base as follows, which is suitably modi ed to t into our notation. 7 De nition 6.1 ([12], [17]). Given a rule base (5), a fuzzy relation RT (x, y), as in (Imp-RT ) modelling this rule base, is coherent if for any x X there exist y Y such that RT (x, y) = 1. The coherence property states that for any x the nal fuzzy output B should be normal, i.e., Ker B = . Coherence of an implicative model of a rule base is very much dictated by the semantics involved [17]. Further, it is essential when using defuzzi cation techniques that are dependent on the kernel to be non-empty. However, there exist other reasonable defuzzi cation methods that do not depend on the kernel of the output fuzzy set and, further, in the setting of function approximation, as is the case here, perhaps there is an arguable justi cation to not to insist on this otherwise extremely important property. Relaxing this property we de ne the following weaker form of coherence. De nition 6.2. For a given rule base (5), a fuzzy relation RT (x, y) is said to be weakly coherent if for any x X there exist y Y such that RT (x, y) > 0. From (FRI-R-Singleton) and (Imp-RT ), we have the following: B (y) = RT (x0, y) = T n i=1(Ai(x0) Bi(y)) = T  A1(x0) B1(y), A2(x0) B2(y), . . . , An(x0) Bn(y)  . Now if the antecedent fuzzy sets are normal and form a Ruspini partition, then x0 intersects atmost two fuzzy sets say, Am, Am+1. Then the above reduces to B (y) = T(Am(x0) Bm(y), Am+1(x0) Bm+1(y)) = T(B m(y), B m+1(y)) , (10) where B m and B m+1 are the fuzzy sets Bm and Bm+1 modi ed by the fuzzy implication with Am(x0) and Am+1(x0), respectively. It is clear that for B to be non-empty the supports of B m and B m+1 should intersect, i.e., a necessary condition is Supp B m \ Supp B m+1 = . (11) Further, the choice of the t-norm T in (10) should also be made accordingly. For instance, a su cient condition on T is that it should be positive (see De nition 2.8). Then from (11) we see that B is non- empty. While coherence insists that the kernels of B m and B m+1 should intersect, the weak coherence de ned above relaxes this to a mere intersection of their supports. It should be noted that while relaxing coherence to weak coherence does expand the set of fuzzy implications that can be considered in R , it still does not encompass the whole set of fuzzy implications I. In the following, we discuss the class of fuzzy implications that can be considered for an FRI with RT to be at least weakly coherent. This leads us to study the e ect of using fuzzy implications to modify fuzzy sets. 6.2. Fuzzy Sets modi ed by Fuzzy Implications From the above section it is clear that to ensure weak coherence, we need to deal with fuzzy sets that are modi ed by a fuzzy implication. Thus studying the properties of such modi ed fuzzy sets is important and we proceed to do this in the section. De nition 6.3. Let C F(X) and I I be any fuzzy implication. We say that a CI F(X) is the modi cation or modi ed fuzzy set of C by I at a given [0, 1] if CI (x) = I( , C(x)), x X. (12) 8 Since in this work we consider modi cation only by a fuzzy implication, we often use the simpler term modi ed fuzzy set without any explicit mention of either I or the [0, 1]. The following results show that modi cation by an I I preserves convexity and also gives some relations between the supports of the original and modi ed fuzzy sets when an I I is used. Proposition 6.4. For a convex fuzzy set C, a fuzzy implication I and any [0, 1], CI = I( , C) is also convex. Proof. C being a convex fuzzy set, for all [0, 1] and x, y X, we have C( x+(1 )y) C(x) C(y). Now for any [0, 1] we have the following: C( x + (1 )y) C(x) C(y) = I( , C( x + (1 )y)) I( , C(x) C(y)) = I( , C( x + (1 )y)) I( , C(x)) I( , C(y)) = CI ( x + (1 )y) CI (x) CI (y). This proves that the modi ed fuzzy set CI = I( , C) is convex. Remark 6.5. In fact, the above result is true for any increasing function t. In Proposition 6.4, t(C) = CI = I( , C), where [0, 1] is a constant. Proposition 6.6. Let C be a bounded, normal, continuous convex fuzzy set, I I and (0, 1). Consider the following inclusion relating the supports of C and its modi ed set CI : Supp CI Supp C . (13) (i) If I is a non-positive fuzzy implication, then there exists an [0, 1] such that (13) is not valid. (ii) For a given I I, let AI = {x [0, 1]|I(x, 0) = 0} and let = inf AI. (a) If < , then (13) is valid always. (b) If > , then (13) is valid only if I is positive. (c) Let = . If AI, then (13) is valid only if I is positive, while (13) holds for any I I if / AI. Proof. (i) Since I is non-positive, there exists some x0, y0 (0, 1) such that I(x0, y0) = 0. By the monotonicity of I we have that for [x0, 1] and y [0, y0], I( , y) = 0. Since C is continuous, normal and convex, there will exist a U X such that C(x) y0 on U. If we take [x0, 1] then CI (x) = 0 for all x U, i.e., Supp CI Supp C. For a graphical illustration where I = IRS, the Rescher implication, see Fig. 1(a). (ii) Let = inf AI = inf{x [0, 1]|I(x, 0) = 0}. Note that for any I I we have I(1, 0) = 0 and hence {x [0, 1]|I(x, 0) = 0} = . Let us consider an [0, 1]. (a) Let < . Then I( , 0) > 0 and by the monotonicity of I, we have I( , ) > 0 for any [0, 1]. On the one hand, if x X \ Supp C, then C(x) = 0 and CI (x) > 0. On the other hand, when x Supp C, then C(x) > 0 and CI (x) > 0. Thus it is clear that Supp C Supp CI and (13) holds. For a graphical illustration where I = IRC, the Reichenbach implication, see Fig. 1(b). (b) Let > . Once again, by the monotonicity of I, we have I( , 0) = 0. If x X \ Supp C, then C(x) = 0 and hence CI (x) = 0. If x Supp C then C(x) (0, 1]. In fact, by the continuity and normality of C, for any (0, 1) there exists an x Supp C such that C(x) = . Now, if I is not positive, i.e., if there exists a (0, 1) such that I( , ) = 0 then for all x Supp C such that C(x) we have that CI (x) = 0. Thus to ensure that (13) holds we need an I which is positive. (c) Let = . If AI, then I( , 0) = I( , 0) = 0 and hence it reduces to the case (b) above. If / AI, then I( , 0) = I( , 0) > 0 and hence it reduces to the case (a) above. 9 (a) Supp CI Supp C (b) Supp C Supp CI Figure 1: Inclusions between the supports of the original and modi ed fuzzy sets, when (a) I is non-positive, (b) I is positive and NI = ND1. Remark 6.7. Note that, from Proposition 6.6 we see that whenever < 1, to ensure that (13) holds we need an I I that is positive. If an I I which is positive and whose NI = ND1 is used to modify C above, then the supports of CI , C are equal, i.e., Supp CI = Supp C, for all (0, 1]. For a graphical illustration where I = IGD, the G odel implication, see Fig. 2. Also, note that when I I is positive but NI = ND1 then the modi ed fuzzy set may have in nite support, in which case (13) holds trivially (Fig. 1(b)). Figure 2: Supp C Supp CI - When I is positive and NI = ND1 - see Remark 6.7 6.3. Types of Fuzzy Implications Considered From Section 6.1 above we know that for an RT to ensure weak coherence, we need the support of the output fuzzy sets B m and B m+1 - which are the modi ed fuzzy sets of Bm, Bm+1 using a fuzzy implication I I - to intersect. Also, it can be seen from Section 6.2 that when we use a non-positive fuzzy implication the supports of these modi ed fuzzy sets can shrink and hence there is a possibility that the intersection of their supports is empty, which is not desirable. Hence to ensure weak coherence at the least, we see that the class of implications I that can be considered should be restricted. Since in most practical settings we deal only with fuzzy sets that are bounded, continuous, convex and that which often form a Ruspini partition, it is su cient to consider fuzzy implications I I that either satisfy the ordering property (OP), i.e., I IOP, in which case often we can ensure even coherence [39], or are positive with NI = ND1, i.e., I I + ND1, in which case we can ensure at least a weak coherence. Thus, in the following sections we will deal with rules modeled by fuzzy relations RT where the fuzzy implication either satis es (OP) or is positive with or without (OP) but whose natural negation NI = ND1, the G odel negation (3). 10 Remark 6.8. Note that the properties (OP), positivity and NI = ND1 are not mutually exclusive. Table 1 lists some fuzzy implications illustrating the same. Implications (OP) Positive NI = ND1 IGG(x, y) = min(1, y x) ILK(x, y) = min(1, 1 x + y) IYG(x, y) = min (1, yx) IRC(x, y) = 1 x + xy IRS(x, y) = ( 1, if x y 0, if x > y I(x, y) = 0, if (x, y) [0.7, 1] [0, 0.6] 0.5, if (x, y) [0.4, 0.7] [0, 0.6] 1, otherwise I(x, y) = 1, if x y 0.5, if x > y and x [0, 0.5) 0, if (x, y) [0.5, 1) [0, 0.5) 0.5, if x > y and y [0.5, 1) I(x, y) = ( 1, if x = 0 or y = 1 0, if x > 0 or y < 1 Table 1: Fuzzy Implications that satisfy some or all of the properties of (OP), positivity and NI = ND1. 6.4. Families of Fuzzy Implications that belong to IOP I + ND1 In fact, many established families of fuzzy implications fall in either of the above two classes. For the de nitions and the properties these families satisfy, please refer to the monograph [2]. Let ITBC denote the set of all R-implications obtained from border continuous t-norms. Then every I ITBC satis es (OP) ([3], Proposition 5.8). Further, the set of all R-implications obtained from left-continuous t-norms ITLC ITBC and hence we have that ITLC ITBC IOP . Let IF denote the set of all f-implications proposed by Yager [42]. Further, let us denote by IF, IF the set of f-implications that are generated from generators such that f(0) = . Every I IF, is positive and their natural negation is the G odel negation (see [19], [1], Proposition 2), i.e., NI = ND1. Thus IF, I + ND1. If IG denotes the set of all g-implications, proposed by Yager [42], then every I IG is positive and NI = ND1 (see [1], Proposition 4). Thus IG I + ND1. If I S denote the set of all (S, N) implications such that N = NS, the natural negation of S, is a strong negation and the pair (S, NS) is such that S(NS(x), x) = 1, x [0, 1] then every I I S satis es (OP) ([3], Theorem 4.7). Hence I S IOP . 11 Let I QL denote the set of QL-implications obtained from the triplet (TM, S, NS) where TM(x, y) = min(x, y), S is any t-conorm and NS, the natural negation of S, is a strong negation and the pair (S, NS) is such that S(NS(x), x) = 1, x [0, 1]. Then every I I QL satis es (OP) ([5], Section 4.4). Hence I QL IOP . Let I QL denote the set of QL-implications obtained from the triplet (TM, S, NS) where NS is a strong negation and S is a right continuous t-conorm. Then every I I QL satis es (OP) ([5], Section 4.4). Hence I QL IOP . For examples of fuzzy implications from other well-known families, viz., (U, N)-, RU-implications and the relationships among the properties they satisfy, please see, for instance, [4, 6] or the works of Bustince et al. [7, 8]. 7. FT OP are Universal Approximators Let us denote by RT OP the fuzzy relation where the fuzzy implication is from IOP, and the corre- sponding FRI by FT OP =  PX, PY , RT OP, d  where, PX = {Ai}n i=1 F(X) and PY = {Bi}n i=1 F(Y ). Recall from (FRI-R-Singleton), for any y Y , B (y) = RT (x0, y) = T n i=1(Ai(x0) OP Bi(y)) = T  A1(x0) OP B1(y), A2(x0) OP B2(y), . . . , An(x0) OP Bn(y)  . (14) Note that to get a nal crisp output y Y , we need to defuzzify the above B F(Y ) using d. In this section, we show that, FRIs FT OP =  PX, PY , RT OP, MOM  are universal approximators, i.e., the system function g of FT OP, as de ned in (9), can approximate any continuous function over a compact set to arbitrary accuracy. Moreover, we show that the system function g is continuous as discussed in [37]. Since the range of a continuous function over a closed and bounded interval is also a closed and bounded interval, in the following results, letting X = [a, b] and if h : X R is any continuous function, we have Y = h(X) = [c, d]. Theorem 7.1. For any continuous function h: [a, b] [c, d] over a closed and bounded interval and an arbitrary given > 0, there is an FRI FT OP =  P[a,b], P[c,d], RT OP, MOM  with P[a,b] and P[c,d] being Ruspini partitions such that (i) the system function g as de ned in (9) is continuous on [a, b], and (ii) max x [a,b] |h(x) g(x)| < . Proof. Let h: [a, b] [c, d] be any continuous function and let an > 0 be given. We present a procedural and stepwise proof of how to realise the FRI FT OP with the speci ed properties. Step I : Choosing the points of normality Since h is continuous over a closed interval [a, b], h is uniformly continuous on [a, b]. Thus for a given > 0 there exists > 0 (depending on ) such that, for all w, w [a, b], |w w | < = |h(w) h(w )| < 2 . Step I (a): A Coarse Initial Partition 12 With the de ned above and taking l = 1 +  b a  we now choose wi [a, b], i = 1, 2, . . . l, such that |wi wi+1| < , where r is the integral value of the number r. Let zi = h(wi), the value h takes at the above chosen wi, for i = 1, 2, . . . l. We call these points wi and zi the points of normality on the input space and the output space, respectively. Step I (b): Redundancy Removal and Reordering Let us choose the distinct zi s from the above and sort them in ascending order. Let : Nl Nk denote the above permuation map such that zi = u (i), for i = 1, 2, . . . l and uj, j = 1, 2, . . . , k are in ascending order. Step I (c): Re nement of the input space partition: Thus for each i = 1, 2, . . . , l we have h(wi) = zi = u (i). However, note that consecutive points of normality wi, wi+1 in the input space need not be mapped to consecutive points of normality u (i), u (i)+1 or u (i), u (i) 1. To ensure the above, we further re ne the input space partition. To this end, we re ne every sub-interval [wi, wi+1], for i = 1, 2, . . . l 1 as follows. Note that h(wi+1) = u (i+1). Re nement Procedure: For every i = 1, 2, . . . l 1 do the following: (i) If u (i+1) = u (i)+1 or u (i) 1 then we do nothing. (ii) Let u (i+1) = u (i)+p, where p 2. For every u {u (i)+1, u (i)+2, . . . , u (i)+p 1} we nd a point v [wi, wi+1] such that h(v) = u. Note that the existence of such a v [wi, wi+1] is guaranteed by the continuity - essentially the ontoness - of the function h. If u = u (i)+q, for some 1 q p 1, then we denote the point v as w(q) i,i+1. (iii) Similarly, let u (i+1) = u (i) p, where p 2. For every u {u (i) 1, u (i) 2, . . . , u (i) p+1} we nd a v [wi, wi+1] such that h(v) = u. Once again, if u = u (i) q, for some 1 q p 1, then we denote v as w(q) i,i+1. Step I (d): Final Points of Normality: Once the above process is done, we again rename the points of normality in the input space, viz., w(q) i,i+1 as x1, x2, . . . , xn(n l) and the u (i) s of the the output space as y1, y2, . . . yk. For a graphical illustration of Step I given above, please see Section 7.1. Step II : Construction of the Fuzzy Partitions - P[a,b], P[c,d] In the next step, we construct fuzzy sets on both the input and output spaces with the above obtained xi s and yj s as the points of normality, as given below. Step II (a): Fuzzy Partition on the input space P[a,b] = {Ai}n i=1. We construct n fuzzy sets such that Supp Ai = (xi 1, xi+1) for i = 2, . . . , n 1, while Supp A1 = [x1, x2) and Supp An = (xn 1, xn], each Ai is normal at xi, i.e., Ai(xi) = 1, each Ai is a continuous convex fuzzy set, strictly increasing on [xi 1, xi] and strictly decreasing on [xi, xi+1]. {Ai}n i=1 form a Ruspini partition (see. for instance (1)). Step II (b): Fuzzy Partition on the output space P[c,d] = {Cj}k j=1. We construct k fuzzy sets in a similar way as above, such that Supp(Cj) = (yj 1, yj+1) for j = 2, . . . , k 1, while Supp(C1) = [y1, y2) and Supp(Ck) = (yk 1, yk], each Cj is normal at yj, i.e., Cj(yj) = 1, each Cj is a continuous convex fuzzy set, strictly increasing on [yj 1, yj] and strictly decreasing on [yj, yj+1]. 13 {Cj}k j=1 form a Ruspini partition. Here obviously, |yj yj 1| < 2, j = 1, 2, . . . k. Step III: Construction of the rule base We construct the rule base with n rules of the form: IF x is Ai THEN y is Cj , i = 1, 2, . . . n, (15) where the consequent Cj in the i-th rule is chosen such that yj = h(xi), where xi is the point at which Ai attains normality. We can rewrite the rule base (15) as follows to con rm to the notations as in (4): IF x is Ai THEN y is Bi , i = 1, 2, . . . n . (16) Firstly, note that not all Bi s may be distinct. Further, since h is continuous, by the above assignment of the rules, we have that rules whose antecedents are adjacent also have adjacent consequents, i.e., for any i = 1, 2, . . . n 1 we have Supp Bi Supp Bi+1 = . In fact, the constructed rule base is also smooth [35], [36], [38]. Step IV : Approximation capability of the output Let x [a, b] be the arbitrary given input. Clearly, x [xm, xm+1] for some m n 1. Once again, by our construction, x belongs to atmost two adjacent Ai s, and they are Am, Am+1. Thus, from (14), B (y) = T [Am(x ) OP Bm(y), Am+1(x ) OP Bm+1(y)] = T [sm OP Bm(y), sm+1 OP Bm+1(y)] where we introduce the notations sm = Am(x ) and sm+1 = Am+1(x ) for better readability in the proofs. Note that since Ai s form a Ruspini partition, we have that sm + sm+1 = 1. Further, note that by the construction of {Ai, Bi}, Bm, Bm+1 are adjacent fuzzy sets. Consider the kernel of B . We choose the defuzzi ed output y such that it belongs to Ker B . In fact, as we show below, by the construction of {Ai, Bi} we see that Ker B is a singleton and this becomes the defuzzi ed output. Since T is a t-norm, we know that T(p, q) = 1 if and only if p = 1 and q = 1. Further, note that p OP q = 1 if and only if p q and sm + sm+1 = 1 and hence we have Ker B = {y|B (y) = 1} = {y|sm OP Bm(y) = 1} \ {y|sm+1 OP Bm+1(y) = 1} = {y|sm Bm(y)} \ {y|sm+1 Bm+1(y)} . Let m = inf{ |sm OP = 1} and m+1 = inf{ |sm+1 OP = 1}. Since OP has (OP), clearly m = sm and m+1 = sm+1. By the continuity and convexity of Bm, Bm+1 there exist am, bm, am+1, bm+1 such that Bm(am) = Bm(bm) = sm and Bm+1(am+1) = Bm+1(bm+1) = sm+1. By the monotonicity of the implication in the second variable, for every y [am, bm] we have that sm Bm(y) = 1 and for every y [am+1, bm+1] we have that sm+1 Bm+1(y) = 1. Thus, {y|sm Bm(y)} = [am, bm] , {y|sm+1 Bm+1(y)} = [am+1, bm+1] , and Ker B = {y|B (y) = 1} = [am, bm] \ [am+1, bm+1]. 14 Claim: Ker B = {am+1} = {bm} = . Firstly, note that for any sm [0, 1] by the normality of Bm we have that Bm(ym) = 1 and hence ym {y | sm Bm(y)} = ym [am, bm] = . Similarly, ym+1 [am+1, bm+1] = . It su ces to show that am+1 bm from whence Ker B = [am+1, bm]. Note that since m < m + 1 and Bm, Bm+1 are adjacent fuzzy sets, either ym < ym+1 or ym > ym+1. Without loss of generality, let us assume ym < ym+1. Now, from am+1 Supp Bm+1 we have that ym am+1 ym+1. Similarly, ym bm ym+1. Hence, ym am+1, bm ym+1. Since, sm + sm+1 = 1 = Bm+1(am+1) + Bm(bm) = 1, = Bm+1(am+1) = 1 Bm(bm), = Bm+1(am+1) = Bm+1(bm), = bm [am+1, bm+1], i.e., am+1 bm . Now, to see that bm = am+1, note that since {Bi} form a Ruspini partition and Bm, Bm+1 are adjacent fuzzy sets, we have Bm+1(am+1) = 1 Bm(am+1) and hence Bm(am+1) = sm = Bm(bm). (17) Since bm, am+1 Supp Bm Supp Bm+1 on which both Bm, Bm+1 are strictly monotonic ( but of opposite types) we have that bm = am+1. Since d is the MOM defuzzi cation, we get that g(x ) = d(B ) = am+1 = bm [ym, ym+1]. Claim: g is continuous on [a, b]. Let us consider an x [a, b]. Clearly, x [xm, xm+1] for some 1 m < n and g(x ) = bm [ym, ym+1]. To show that g is continuous at x , we need to show that for any given > 0, we can nd a > 0 such that, for any x [a, b], whenever |x x | < then |g(x ) g(x )| < . (18) Since Bm is strictly decreasing and continuous on [ym, ym+1], we have that B 1 m : [0, 1] [ym, ym+1] exists. Thus from (17) we have bm = B 1 m (sm). Further, B 1 m is strictly decreasing and continuous on [0, 1]. Hence, for any 1 > 0 there exists some 1 > 0 such that for any s m [0, 1], |s m sm| < 1 = |B 1 m (s m) B 1 m (sm)| < 1. (19) Since Am : [xm, xm+1] [0, 1] is continuous, for any 2 > 0 there exists some 2 > 0 such that |x x | < 2 = |Am(x ) Am(x )| < 2. (20) Let s m = Am(x ). Then g(x ) = b m [ym, ym+1] and |s m sm| = |Am(x ) Am(x )| , and (21) |g(x ) g(x )| = |b m bm| = |B 1 m (s m) B 1 m (sm)| . (22) Now, let us set 1 = and 2 = 1. Then, for = 2, we have |x x | < = |Am(x ) Am(x )| < 2 , using (20) = |s m sm| < 2 = 1 , using (21) = |B 1 m (s m) B 1 m (sm)| < 1 = , using (19) = |b m bm| < , = |g(x ) g(x )| < . using (22) 15 Figure 3: An Illustrative Example for Step I in the proof of Theorem 7.1. The intersection of the thin-dotted and thick-dotted lines with the x-axis give the points wi and w(q) i,i+1, respectively. Thus for any > 0, there exists a > 0 such that, whenever |x x | < then |g(x ) g(x )| < , i.e., g is continuous on [a, b] . Clearly, now, |ym g(x )| < 2 or |ym+1 g(x )| < 2 . Without loss of generality, let |ym g(x )| < 2. Further, since x [xm, xm+1] we have |h(x ) ym| < 2. Putting them all together, we have |g(x ) h(x )| |g(x ) ym| + |ym h(x )| < 2 + 2 < . Since x is arbitrary we have, max x [a,b] |h(x) g(x)| < . 7.1. Some Illustrative Remarks on the proof of Theorem 7.1 In this section we illustrate some steps of the proof of the Theorem 7.1 through gures and examples for better understanding. Step I : Choosing the points of normality Step I (a): A Coarse Initial Partition In Fig. 3, the points w1, w2, . . . , w11 and the points z1, z2, . . . z8 (in paranthesis) are the points of normality in the input and the output spaces, respectively. Step I (b): Redundancy Removal and Reordering By rearranging the zi s in ascending order and re- naming them we obtain: u1 = z1 < u2 = z8 < u3 = z6 < u4 = z5 < u5 = z7 < u6 = z2 < u7 = z4 < u8 = z3. Step I (c): Re nement of the input space partition: In Fig. 3, h(w1) = u1 and h(w2) = u6. Thus for the consecutive points w1 and w2 the function values are u1 and u6, which are not consecutive. Re nement Procedure: 16 From Fig. 3, it can be seen that we have inserted points w(1) 1,2, w(2) 1,2, w(3) 1,2, w(4) 1,2 [w1, w2]. Proceeding similarly, the following sub-intervals, shown in Fig. 3, have been re ned: [w2, w3], [w4, w5], [w8, w9] and [w9, w10]. Step II (a): Fuzzy Partition on the input space P[a,b] = {Ai}n i=1. For instance, let each of the Ai s (i = 2, . . . , n 1) be a triangular fuzzy set, (i.e, each Ai is linear and strictly increasing on [xi 1, xi], each Ai is linear and strictly decreasing on [xi, xi+1]), let A1 be right- half-triangular, (i.e., A1 is linear and strictly decreasing on [x1, x2)) and let An be left-half-triangular, (i.e., An is linear and strictly increasing on (xn 1, xn]). Further, let all the Ai s attain normality at xi. Then, clearly, the fuzzy partition {Ai}n i=1 of the input space [a, b] is a Ruspini partition and each of the Ai s is continuous, convex, of nite support and Ai(xi) = 1. 8. FT D1 are Universal Approximators While in the previous section, we dealt with fuzzy implications satisfying (OP), this class of fuzzy implications is rather limited. In this section, we consider those positive implications whose natural negations are G odel negation. Let us denote by RT D1 the fuzzy relation where the fuzzy implication is from I + ND1 and the corre- sponding FRI by FT D1 =  PX, PY , RT D1 , d  where, PX = {Ai} and PY = {Bi}. Once again, recall that from (FRI-R-Singleton), with R = RT D1 for any y Y , we have B (y) = RT D1 (x0, y) = T n i=1(Ai(x0) D1 Bi(y)) = T  A1(x0) D1 B1(y), A2(x0) D1 B2(y), . . . , An(x0) D1 Bn(y)  . (23) We now show that the FRIs FT D1 =  PX, PY , RT D1, MOM  are universal approximators, i.e., they can approximate any continuous function over a compact set to arbitrary accuracy. Theorem 8.1. For any continuous function h: [a, b] [c, d] over a closed interval and an arbitrary given > 0, there is an FRI FT D1 =  P[a,b], P[c,d], RT D1 , MOM  with P[a,b] and P[c,d] being Ruspini partitions such that the system function g approximates h uniformly, i.e., max x [a,b] |h(x) g(x)| < . Proof. Once again the proof is given in four steps. Steps I III dealing with the construction of the input and output partitions and the rule base are done in exactly the same way as in Steps I III of the proof of Theorem 7.1. Step IV: Approximation capability of the output Once again, let x [a, b] be the arbitrary given input. Clearly, x [xm, xm+1] for some m l 1. Once again, by our construction, x belongs to Am, Am+1. Thus, from (23), B (y) = T [Am(x ) D1 Bm(y), Am+1(x ) D1 Bm+1(y)] = T [sm D1 Bm(y), sm+1 D1 Bm+1(y)] = T  B m(y), B m+1(y)  where sm = Am(x ) and sm+1 = Am+1(x ). Note that since Ai s form a Ruspini partition, we have that sm + sm+1 = 1. Now since D1 is positive and such that x D1 0 = 0 for any x (0, 1], we have from Remark 6.7 that the supports of both the modi ed fuzzy sets B m, B m+1 are the same as those of Bm, Bm+1, i.e., Supp B m=Supp Bm and Supp B m+1 = Supp Bm+1. Hence, Supp B = Supp B m Supp B m+1 = Supp Bm Supp Bm+1 = Supp (Bm Bm+1) = [ym, ym+1] . (24) 17 Now, since (24) holds, we have g(x ) = MOM(B ) Supp (Bm Bm+1) = [ym, ym+1] . Thus, |ym g(x )| < 2 and |ym+1 g(x )| < 2. Once again, since x [xm, xm+1] we have |h(x ) ym| < 2. Putting them all together, we have |g(x ) h(x )| |g(x ) ym| + |ym h(x )| < 2 + 2 < . Since x [a, b] is arbitrary, we have that max x [a,b] |h(x) g(x)| < . 9. Illustrative Examples In this section we illustrate our results through some examples. We consider 3 functions one each from the following three types or classes of functions, viz., those that are (i) purely monotonic, (ii) mixed monotonic and symmetric, and (iii) mixed monotonic and asymmetric. We then approximate these functions by the FRIs FT OP or FT D1 as proposed and constructed in Sections 7 and 8. We consider the Mean of Maxima defuzzi cation and the input and output space partitions are con- structed as detailed in Section 7. However, we consider di erent fuzzy implication operators I coming from both the classes, viz., IOP and I + ND1, in the examples. In the given gures, the original functions h(x) are shown in thick lines, the approximating system functions g(x) in thin lines and the bounds h(x) and h(x) + are plotted using dotted lines. Example 9.1. Let us consider the function h(x) = ln(x), x [2, 7] , which is strictly increasing on the interval [2, 7] and let = 0.1. According to the proposed construction we obtain 50 rules, since = = 0.1. We approximate h using the FRI FT OP, where the implication operator employed in the relation RT OP is the Rescher implication IRS IOP \ I + ND1 (see Table 1), which satis es (OP) and its natural negation NIRS = ND1, but IRS is not positive. The function h and its approximation g are shown in Fig. 4. Example 9.2. Let us consider the function h(x) = sin(x), x [ 2 , 2 ] , which is mixed monotonic and symmetric on the interval [ 2 , 2 ]. However, note that it is piecewise strictly increasing or decreasing. Let = 0.1. According to the proposed construction we obtain 130 rules. We approximate h using the FRI FT OP, where the implication operator employed in the relation RT OP is the Lukasiewicz implication ILK IOP \ I + ND1 (see Table 1) which satis es (OP) and is positive, but NILK = ND1. The function h and its approximation g are shown in Fig. 5. Example 9.3. Let us consider the function h(x) = x4 + 2x2 x, x [ 2, 2] , which is both mixed monotonic and asymetric on the interval [ 2, 2]. Let = 2. It is clear from the proof of Theorem 7.1 that the obtained for a given is extremely conservative. Thus, in this case we would get a = 0.0025. However, we have assumed = 0.25 and proceeded to verify the approximation capability. According to the proposed construction, with = 0.25, we obtain 20 rules by Step I(a) of Theorem 7.1, which are then re ned to 38 rules by Step I(b) and Step I(c) of Theorem 7.1. We approximate h using the FRI FT D1 , where the implication operator employed in the relation RT D1 is 18 Figure 4: The natural logarithm function h(x) = ln x approximated within = 0.1 bound over [2, 7] Figure 5: The function h(x) = sin(x) approximated within = 0.1 bound over [ 2 , 2 ]. the Yager implication IYG I + ND1 \ IOP (see Table 1) which does not satisfy (OP), but is both positive and NIYG = ND1. The approximated function is shown in Fig. 6. Fig. 6(a) gives the plot of the approximator g that was obtained from the original rule base with 20 rules that were obtained before the re nement of the input space, while Fig. 6(b) gives the plot of the system function g that was obtained by employing the re ned rule base with 38 rules. 19 (a) Using 20 rules obtained from the unre ned partition (b) Using 38 rules obtained from the re ned partition Figure 6: A 4th degree polynomial h(x) = x4 + 2x2 x approximated over [ 2, 2] within = 2 bound. 10. Concluding Remarks In this work, we provide a constructive proof of the universal approximation properties of FRIs when implicative rules are employed, i.e., where the operation between the antecedents and consequents is taken as a fuzzy implication. We show that FRIs of the form FT =  PX, PY , RT , d  are universal approximators. The proof is general enough for a large class of fuzzy implications I - without making any assumptions about the form or 20 representation of the considered fuzzy implications - and is valid for any continuous function, not necessarily monotonic and the partitions used are of the Ruspini type. From Step I(a) of the proof of Theorem 7.1, note that the number of rules generated from the proposed construction in Section 7 is dependent both on the function and the value given but not on the fuzzy implication employed in FT . It is also clear from the illustrated examples that even a coarser partition of the input space than what is proposed can still approximate the given function within the bounds, i.e., even with a bigger we can still get the same approximation. Of course, the itself can be adapted depending on the prior knowledge of the slope of the given function to be approximated. In the literature, it is typical to consider an R-implication obtained from a left-continuous t-norm in the fuzzy relation R (see (7)) to model a rule base. However, in this work, the R that is considered is much more general, i.e., the fuzzy implications considered come from a much larger set than just the R-implications obtained from a left-continuous t-norm, which satisfy (OP) and hence ensure the coherence of the implicative model of the rule base. Further, the concept of weak coherence proposed in this work played an important role in enlarging the class of fuzzy implications that can be considered for implicative models. Section 6.4 lists some families of fuzzy implications that are admissible under this context. Recently, in [25], it was shown that the Bandler-Kohout Subproduct inference (BKS-R) employing the Yager s families of fuzzy implications [42], namely, f- and g-implications, and the rule base modeled by the following relation, RT (x, y) = RY (x, y) = n ^ i=1 (Ai(x) Y Bi(y)), (25) where Y is once again either an f- or a g-implication, i.e., Y belongs to IF IG (see Section 6.4), have many desirable properties namely, interpolativity, continuity and robustness. Note that all f- and g-implications are positive and those that belong to IF, IG are such that their natural negations are the G odel negation. This work clearly demonstrates that such FRIs are also universal approximators. Thus, we believe that these results are very much applicable in most of the practical and desirable contexts as discussed in these works [17, 40, 39] and show that a much larger class of fuzzy implications other than what is typically considered in the literature can be employed meaningfully in FRIs based on implicative models.
