Keywords Solid transportation problem Blending Rough variable Trust measure Chance-constrained programming 1 Introduction In many industries like oil re ning, chemical, petroleum and process; shipping of nal products involves a common issue called product blending, i.e., blending raw materials with different attributes (purity, concentration levels, etc.) into desired homogeneous intermediate or end products. As an example, suppose a particular product of different quali- ties are transported to different demand points from various sources, provided that the products are blended at each des- tination must maintain the desired quality. In other words, the amount of products with different qualities will reach at a destination so that they can be blended together to meet the desired quality of product at that demand point. Such type of blending in the petroleum industry is very often observed (Rigby et al. 1995). The optimal scheduling of crude oil has been shown to lead to high bene ts (Kelly and Mann 2003). Aninterestinghistoryofblendinginthepetroleumindustryis mentioned in DeWitt et al. (1989), Romo et al. (2009), M n- dez et al. (2006) and Misener and Floudas (2009). Recently, Papageorgiou et al. (2012) studied a uncapacitated xed- charge transportation problem with product blending. 123 2298 P. Kundu et al. Theclassicaltransportationproblem(TP)dealswithtrans- portation of goods from some sources to certain destinations. Solid transportation problem (STP) is an extension of clas- sical TP. In STP, three kinds of constraints are taken into consideration instead of two (sources and destination con- straints) in a TP. This extra constraint may be due to modes of transportation (conveyances), types of goods, etc. Tradition- ally, STP (Haley 1962; Jim nez and Verdegay 1998, 1999; Liu 2006; Yang and Liu 2007; Nagarjan and Jeyaraman 2010; Ojha et al. 2009; Kundu et al. 2013a, 2014) is modeled con- sidering total supply capacity of all the conveyances and it is assumed that this total capacity is available for utilization from all sources to destinations routes. However, in many practical situations, this may not always be true. Practically, most of the time full vehicles, e.g., trucks, rail coaches, etc. are to be booked and the availability of each type of con- veyances at each source may not be the same. Ful llment of the capacity of a vehicle affects the optimal transportation policy, as generally the unit transportation costs are deter- mined on utilization of capacity of the vehicle. To deal with such practical situations, we formulate a useful solid trans- portation model. Future transportation planning always depends upon pre- vious experiences. But the available data in a transportation system, such as transportation costs, supplies, demands, con- veyance capacities are not always available precisely but are uncertain in nature, due to insuf cient information, uctuat- ing nancial market, lack of evidence, data collected from multiple sources, etc. Many researchers studied STP with different uncertain parameters such as fuzzy (e.g., Chanas and Kuchta 1996; Jim nez and Verdegay 1999; Yang and Liu 2007; Ojha et al. 2009; Kaur and Kumar 2012; Kundu et al. 2013a, 2014), stochastic (e.g., Yang and Feng 2007; Nagarjan and Jeyaraman 2010). Rough set theory is one of the most convenient and accepted tool to deal with uncer- tainty. Though transportation problems in various types of uncertain environments such as fuzzy, random are studied by many researchers, there are few research papers (Tao and Xu 2012; Kundu et al. 2013b) in rough uncertain environ- ment. Rough set theory was rst proposed by Pawlak (1982). Later it was developed by many researchers (Pawlak 1991; PawlakandSkowron2007; Polkowski 2002). Liu(2002) pro- posed the concept of rough variable which is a measurable function from rough space to the set of real numbers and developed trust theory to study the behavior of rough events. Liu (2002, 2004) studied some rough programming models with rough variables as parameters. Liu and Zhu (2007) intro- duced X-valued rough variable. Xu and Yao (2010) studied a two-personzero-summatrixgamewithpayoffsasroughvari- ables. Xu et al. (2009) proposed a rough DEA model to solve a supply chain performance evaluation problem with rough parameters. Mondal et al. (2013) considered a production repairing inventory model with fuzzy rough variables. In this paper, we formulate a solid transportation problem with product blending (STPwB). There are several sources of a certain petroleum or chemical product with different qual- ity levels, and the product has demand at several demand points with different quality levels. Each demand point (des- tination) has quality checking process and they receive the product only if its quality satis es a minimum desired qual- ity predetermined at the demand point. The problem is to transport different quality products from different sources to different destinations so that the products received at each destination can be blended together to meet the required quality as well as to satisfy the demanded amount at that destination. For blending purpose, it is assumed that each destination has blending headers or charging points. The objective of this problem is minimization of total logis- tics (transportation) costs. The parameters of this problem such as transportation costs, availabilities, demands are taken as rough variables to deal with increasing uncertain- ties in decision making problems. We formulate a rough chance-constrained programming model for the STPwB with parameters as rough variables and its crisp form is obtained to solve the problem. The constrained cost minimization problem is solved by gradient based non-linear optimization technique-Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG) method (using Lingo 13.0). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, some basic concepts and properties of rough set are reviewed. Section 3 proposes the single objective transportation model for STPwB. Section 4 describes the solution methodology of STPwB with parameters as rough variables. In Sect. 5, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the model. Finally, Sect. 6 provides conclusions and directions for fur- ther research. 2 Preliminaries Here, we present some basic concepts on rough variables. Rough set theory, introduced by Pawlak (1982), has been proved to be an ef cient mathematical tool dealing with vague/imprecise description of objects. The idea of rough set theory comes from approximation of a subset of a certain universe by means of lower and upper approximations using the information contained in an another known subset. The lower approximation is a de nable (exact) subset containing the objects surely belonging to the set, whereas the upper approximation is a superset containing the objects possibly belonging to the set. In other words a rough set is de ned by a pair of crisp sets, called lower and upper approxima- tions those are originally produced by an equivalent relation. To deal with vast complexities of the real-world problems, many researchers considered some generalizations of basic rough sets so that rough set theory has wide applications. In 123 A solid transportation model with product blending and parameters as rough variables 2299 this study, we mainly concentrate on the concepts of rough variable (Liu 2002, 2004) and trust theory which is a branch of mathematics that studies the behavior of rough events. 2.1 Rough variable The concept of rough variable was introduced by Liu (2002). The following de nitions are based on Liu (2002, 2004). De nition 2.1.1 (Rough space) Let  be a nonempty set, A be a -algebra of subsets of ,  be an element in A, and be a nonnegative, real-valued and additive set function on A. Then (, , A, ) is called a rough space. De nition 2.1.2 (Rough variable) A rough variable on the rough space (, , A, ) is a measurable function from  to the set of real numbers such that for every Borel set B of , we have {  | ( ) B} A. Then the lower and upper approximations of the rough variable , denoted by and , respectively, are de ned as follows: = { ( ) | } and = { ( ) | }. De nition 2.1.3 Let be a rough vector on the rough space (, , A, ), and f j : n be continuous functions, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. Then the upper and lower trusts of the rough event characterized by f j( ) 0; j = 1, 2, . . . , m are, respectively, de ned by T r{ f j( ) 0} = { | f j( ( )) 0} () , and Tr{ f j( ) 0}= { | f j( ( )) 0} () , j =1, 2, . . . , m. If () = 0, then the upper and lower trusts of the rough event are assumed to be equivalent, i.e., T r{ f j( ) 0} Tr{ f j( ) 0}, j = 1, 2, . . . , m. The trust of the rough event is de ned as the average value of the lower and upper trusts, i.e., Tr{ f j( ) 0} = 1 2(T r{ f j( ) 0} + Tr{ f j( ) 0}), j = 1, 2, . . . , m. De nition 2.1.4 Let be a rough variable on the rough space (, , A, ) and (0, 1], then sup( ) = sup{r|Tr{ r} } is called -optimistic value to and inf ( ) = inf{r|Tr{ r} } is called -pessimistic value to . De nition 2.1.5 Let be a rough variable on the rough space (, , A, ). The expected value of is de ned as follows E[ ] =  0 Tr{ r}dr  0 Tr{ r}dr. Example 2.1 Let = ([a, b], [c, d]) be a rough variable withc a < b d, where[a, b] and[c, d] are, respectively, the lower and upper approximations of . It implies that the elements in [a, b] are certainly members of the variable and the elements of [c, d] are possible members of the variable. Here,  = { |a b} and  = { |c d}, (x) = x for all x , A is the Borel algebra on  and is the Lebesgue measure. As a practical example, consider the possible transporta- tion cost of unit product to be transported from a source i to a destination j through a conveyance k for a certain time period. However, as transportation cost depends upon fuel price, labor charges, tax, road condition, etc., and each of which uctuates with time, it is not always possible to determine or predict exact value of transportation cost. Sup- pose four experts give the possible unit transportation cost for the route i j through conveyance k, determined in a certain time period, as intervals [3,5], [3.5,6], [4,5] and [4,6], respectively. Let ci jk denote the possible value of the unit transportation cost for the route i j through con- veyance kk . Then ci jk cannot have an exact value and can be approximated by means of lower and upper approxima- tions. It is clear that [4,5] is the lower approximation of ci jk as it is the longest de nable (exact) set that ci jk contains, i.e., every member of [4,5] is certainly a value of ci jk. Here, [3,6] is the upper approximation, as members of [3,6] may or may not be possible transportation cost according to all experts. So, ci jk can be represented as a rough variable ([4,5], [3,6]). For a given value r and = ([a, b], [c, d]), trust of rough events characterized by r and r (Liu, 2002, 2004) is, respectively, given by the following expressions Tr{ r} = 0, if r c; r c 2(d c), if c r a; 1 2( r a b a + r c d c), if a r b; 1 2( r c d c + 1), if b r d; 1, if r d. (1) 123 2300 P. Kundu et al. Fig. 1 The trust of the rough event de ned in (1) r and (2) r Tr{ r} = 0, if r d; d r 2(d c), if b r d; 1 2( d r d c + b r b a ), if a r b; 1 2( d r d c + 1), if c r a; 1, if r c. (2) Rough variable = ([4, 5], [2, 7]), Tr{ r} and Tr{ r} are depicted in Fig. 1. For = ([a, b], [c, d]), using De nition 2.1.4 and Eq. (2), -optimistic value to is obtained as sup( ) = (1 2 )d + 2 c, if ((d b)/2(d c)); 2(1 )d + (2 1)c, if ((2d a c)/2(d c)); d(b a)+b(d c) 2 (b a)(d c) (b a)+(d c) , otherwise. (3) and using Eq. (1), -pessimistic value to is inf ( ) = (1 2 )c + 2 d, if ((a c)/2(d c)); 2(1 )c + (2 1)d, if ((b + d 2c)/2(d c)); c(b a)+a(d c)+2 (b a)(d c) (b a)+(d c) , otherwise. (4) The expected value of , E( ) = 1 4(a + b + c + d). 2.2 Theorem 1 If = ([a, b], [c, d]) be a rough variable with c a < b d, then for a predetermined , 0 < 1, Tr{ r} is equivalent to (i) (1 2 )c + 2 d r, when a c 2(d c), (ii) 2(1 )c + (2 1)d r, when b+d 2c 2(d c) , (iii) c(b a)+a(d c)+2 (b a)(d c) (b a)+(d c) r, otherwise. Proof For a given valuer and = ([a, b], [c, d]), Tr{ r} is given by (1). Case I: For c r a and predetermined , from (1) we have Tr{ r} r c 2(d c) (1 2 )c + 2 d r. However, in this case, maximum possible value of Tr{ r} can be ((a c)/2(d c)) and minimum possible value is 0 so that the value of must be less or equal to ((a c)/2(d c)). Case II: For b r d and predetermined , Tr{ r} 1 2( r c d c +1) 2(1 )c+(2 1)d r In this case, maximum possible value of Tr{ r} can be 1 and minimum possible value is 1 2( b c d c + 1) so that the value of must be greater or equal to 1 2( b c d c + 1), which implies b+d 2c 2(d c) . Case III: For a r b and predetermined , Tr{ r} 1 2(r a b a + r c d c) c(b a)+a(d c)+2 (b a)(d c) (b a)+(d c) r. In this case (i.e., a r b), minimum possible value of Tr{ r} can be ((a c)/2(d c)) and maximum possible value is 1 2(1 + b c d c) = b+d 2c 2(d c) and hence the proof is complete. 123 A solid transportation model with product blending and parameters as rough variables 2301 2.3 Theorem 2 If = ([a, b], [c, d]) be a rough variable with c a < b d, then for a predetermined , 0 < 1, Tr{ r} is equivalent to (i) (1 2 )d + 2 c r, when d b 2(d c), (ii) 2(1 )d + (2 1)c r, when 2d a c 2(d c) , (iii) d(b a)+b(d c) 2 (b a)(d c) (b a)+(d c) r, otherwise. Proof Using expression of Tr{ r} as given in (2), the proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 1. 3 Description of the problem and model formulation In traditional STP, total transportation capacity of all types of conveyances is assumed to be utilized for all routes irrespec- tive of the allocation of products in the routes. However, in many real transportation systems, different types of vehicles (e.g., trucks for road transportation, coaches for rail trans- portation, etc.) are to be booked and number of vehicles are determined according to the amount of products to be trans- ported through a particular route. The dif culty, in this case, arises when the amount of allocated product is not suf cient to utilize the full capacity of the vehicle. As the unit trans- portation cost is generally determined on the total capacity of the vehicle, some extra cost is incurred if the vehicle is not lled up. To deal with these situations, we formulate a solid transportation model with vehicle capacity. Suppose, qk be the capacity of a single vehicle of kth type conveyance. Let zi jk be the frequency (number of vehicles required) of conveyance k for transporting goods from source i to destination j and xi jk (decision variable) be the corre- sponding amount of goods to be transported. Then zi jk is also a decision variable which takes only positive integer or zero and if the vehicle capacity is qk, then we have xi jk zi jk qk. For this type of vehicle transportation system, unit trans- portation cost depends upon the utilization of the capacity of the vehicle. Let us denote the route from source i to destina- tion j through the conveyance k as i j k. Then for the route i j k, if the unit transportation cost ci jk is determined on full utilization of the vehicle capacity qk, then an extra cost (penalty) will be added if the capacity qk is not fully utilized. Additional cost for de cit amount depends upon the corresponding transportation authority. Two cases may arise, either the authority does not compromise with variation of de cit amount and so a direct cost ci jk is considered as the additional cost for unit de cit amount, or the authority agrees to compromise and xes an additional cost for unit amount of de cit. In the rst case, transportation cost of fully loaded vehicle will be charged whatever be the actual amount of transportation. To determine the additional cost, we rst cal- culate the de cit amount of goods to the total capacity of the vehicles for each route. This can be done in two ways, either by calculating the de cit amount for i j k route directly as (zi jk qk xi jk), or by calculating the empty ratio of vehicle of kth type conveyance for transporting goods from source i to destination j as follows: di jk =  0, if xi jk qk = [ xi jk qk ]; 1 ( xi jk qk [ xi jk qk ]), otherwise. sothatthede citamountfori j k routeisgivenbyqk di jk. Now if ui jk represents additional cost for unit amount of de cit from source i to destination j via conveyance k, then additional cost i jk for this route is given by i jk = ui jk(zi jk qk xi jk) or i jk = ui jk qk di jk. The total additional (penalty) cost for the problem is C(x) = m  i=1 n  j=1 K  k=1 i jk and so the total transportation cost becomes Z = m  i=1 n  j=1 K  k=1 (ci jk xi jk + i jk). (5) In many operational and planning models within the chemical, petroleum, gasoline and process industries, a com- mon issue involves blending raw materials with varying attributes and concentration levels into homogeneous inter- mediate or end products. Blending raw materials affords an organization the opportunity to realize sizable cost savings while meeting demand for a set of nal products, and sat- isfying predetermined quality requirements for each type of product. The inherent exibility of the blending process can be exploited to optimize the allocation and transportation of raw materials to production facilities. So, STP with this blending incorporates an additional proportionality require- ment on the quality of the product. Speci cally, let pi denotes the nominal quality (or purity) of product available from sup- plier (source) i, and let pmin j denotes the minimum quality required at destination (consumer/demand point) j. Then, the additional constraint, which we refer to as a linear blending constraint, requires that the average quality of all products received by consumer j must be at least pmin j , where we assume that products received at a destination can be blended 123 2302 P. Kundu et al. together to meet the requirement. Now the average quality of all the products received at destination j is as follows: m i=1 K k=1 pi xi jk m i=1 K k=1 xi jk , j = 1, 2, . . . , n. As pmin j is the minimum quality of the product required at destination j, the constraint on the quality requirement of the product can be represented as given in (6). m i=1 K k=1 pi xi jk m i=1 K k=1 xi jk pmin j , j m  i=1 K  k=1 (pi pmin j )xi jk 0, j. (6) Let each source i have minimum and maximum amounts of supplies of the given product, denoted by al i and au i , respectively. Similarly, each consumer j has a minimum and maximum demand for the product, denoted bl j and bu j , respectively. Finally, the mathematical model of the solid transportation problem with product blending (STPwB) is given below in (7) (12). Min Z = m  i=1 n  j=1 K  k=1 (ci jk xi jk + i jk) (7) s.t. m  i=1 K  k=1 (pi pmin j )xi jk 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (8) al i n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk au i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (9) bl j m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk bu j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (10) xi jk zi jk qk, i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n; k = 1, 2, . . . , K (11) xi jk 0, zi jk N0 i, j, k, (12) where N0 denotes the set of nonnegative integers. 4 STPwB with parameters as rough variables Consider the unit transportation costs ci jk, unit additional costs ui jk, supplies al i, au i and demands bl j, bu j as rough vari- ables for the model (7) (12) and represented by ci jk = ([c2 i jk, c3 i jk], [c1 i jk, c4 i jk]), ui jk = ([u2 i jk, u3 i jk], [u1 i jk, u4 i jk]), al i = ([al2 i , al3 i ], [al1 i , al4 i ]), au i = ([au2 i , au3 i ], [au1 i , au4 i ]), bl j = ([bl2 j , bl3 j ], [bl1 j , bl4 j ]) and bu j = ([bu2 j , bu3 j ], [bu1 j , bu4 j ]), respectively, where c1 i jk c2 i jk < c3 i jk c4 i jk, u1 i jk u2 i jk < u3 i jk u4 i jk and so on. Since ci jk and ui jk are rough variables and xi jk 0 for all i, j, k, then the objective function of the model (7) (12), i.e., Z = m i=1 n j=1 K k=1 (ci jk xi jk + i jk), i jk = ui jk(zi jk qk xi jk) becomes a rough variable de ned as Z = ([Z2, Z3], [Z1, Z4]), where Zr = m  i=1 n  j=1 K  k=1 (cr i jk xi jk + r i jk), r = 1, 2, 3, 4, (13) r i jk = ur i jk(zi jk qk xi jk), r = 1, 2, 3, 4. Rough chance-constrained programming: In chance- constrained programming (CCP), the uncertain constraints are allowed to vary such that constraints must be satis ed at some chance (/con dence) level. Liu and Iwamura (1998) presented chance-constrained programming with fuzzy para- meters. Yang and Liu (2007), Kundu et al. (2014) applied chance-constrained programming to solve solid transporta- tion problem in fuzzy environment. Applying the idea of CCP technique, we formulate rough chance-constrained pro- gramming (CCP) using trust measure for the model (7) (12) with rough parameters. Since the problem is a minimization problem, we minimize the smallest possible objective Z sat- isfying Tr{Z Z} , where (0, 1] is a speci ed trust (con dence) level, i.e., we minimize the -pessimistic value Zinf( ) of Z. Now we formulate the rough CCP as follows: Min (Min Z) (14) s.t. Tr{Z Z} , (15) m  i=1 K  k=1 pi pmin j xi jk 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (16) Tr n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk au i u i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (17) Tr n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk al i l i, i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (18) Tr  m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk bl j  l j, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (19) Tr  m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk bu j  u j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (20) xi jk zi jk qk, i = 1, 2, . . . , m; j = 1, 2, . . . , n; k = 1, 2, . . . , K, (21) xi jk 0, zi jk N0 i, j, k, (22) 123 A solid transportation model with product blending and parameters as rough variables 2303 where u i , l i, l j and u j are the predetermined trust levels of the source and destination constraints. Here N0 denotes the set of nonnegative integers. 4.1 Crisp equivalence The objective function of the above CCP model, i.e., Min Z s.t. Tr{Z Z} is actually the -pessimistic value Zinf( ) of Z and so equal to Z (say) which is obtained using (4) as Z = Zinf ( ) = (1 2 )Z1 + 2 Z4, if Z2 Z1 2(Z4 Z1); 2(1 )Z1 + (2 1)Z4, if Z3+Z4 2Z1 2(Z4 Z1) ; Z1(Z3 Z2)+Z2(Z4 Z1)+2 (Z3 Z2)(Z4 Z1) (Z3 Z2)+(Z4 Z1) , otherwise. (23) In the constraint, given in (17), au i represents a rough variable. Using Theorem 2 (Sect. 2.3), crisp form of this constraint, i.e., Tr{au i n j=1 K k=1 xi jk} u i becomes n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fau i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (24) where Fau i = (1 2 u i )au4 i + 2 u i au1 i , if u i au4 i au3 i 2(au4 i au1 i ); 2(1 u i )au4 i + (2 u i 1)au1 i , if u i 2au4 i au2 i au1 i 2(au4 i au1 i ) ; au4 i (au3 i au2 i )+au3 i (au4 i au1 i ) 2 u i (au3 i au2 i )(au4 i au1 i ) (au3 i au2 i )+(au4 i au1 i ) , otherwise. (25) In the constraint given in (18), al i represents a rough variable. Using Theorem 1 (Sect. 2.2), crisp form of this constraint, i.e., Tr{al i n j=1 K k=1 xi jk} l i becomes n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fal i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (26) where Fal i = (1 2 l i)al1 i + 2 l ial4 i , if l i al2 i al1 i 2(al4 i al1 i ); 2(1 l i)al1 i + (2 l i 1)al4 i , if l i al3 i +al4 i 2al1 i 2(al4 i al1 i ) ; al1 i (al3 i al2 i )+al2 i (al4 i al1 i )+2 l i (al3 i al2 i )(al4 i al1 i ) (al3 i al2 i )+(al4 i al1 i ) , otherwise. (27) Similarly the crisp forms of the constraints (19) and (20), obtained using Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, are respectively as given below m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fbl j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (28) m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fbu j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (29) where Fbl j = (1 2 l j)bl1 j + 2 l jbl1 j , if l j bl2 j bl1 j 2(bl4 j bl1 j ); 2(1 l j)bl1 j + (2 l j 1)bl4 j , if l j bl3 j +bl4 j 2bl1 j 2(bl4 j bl1 j ) ; bl1 j (bl3 j bl2 j )+bl2 j (bl4 j bl1 j )+2 l j(bl3 j bl2 j )(bl4 j bl1 j ) (bl3 j bl2 j )+(bl4 j bl1 j ) , otherwise.

(31) So crisp form of the CCP model (14) (22) can be written as Min Z (32) s.t. m  i=1 K  k=1 (pi pmin j )xi jk 0, j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (33) n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fau i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (34) n  j=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fal i , i = 1, 2, . . . , m, (35) m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fbl j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (36) m  i=1 K  k=1 xi jk Fbu j , j = 1, 2, . . . , n, (37) xi jk zi jk qk, i = 1, . . . , m; j = 1, . . . , n; k = 1, . . . , K, (38) xi jk 0, zi jk N0 i, j, k. (39) 5 Numerical experiment Consider the STPwB model (7) (12) with three sources (i = 1, 2, 3), three destinations ( j = 1, 2, 3), and two types of conveyances (k = 1, 2). The unit transportation costs are rough variables and given in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, for two types of conveyances. The minimum and maximum availabilities at each source, and demand of each destination are represented by rough variables, which are given below. al 1 = ([20, 22], [19, 23]), au 1 = ([26, 27], [24, 28]), al 2 = ([14, 15], [12, 16]), au 2 = ([19, 20], [18, 21]), al 3 = ([24, 25], [23, 27]), au 3 = ([31, 34], [30, 36]), bl 1 = Table 1 Unit transportation costs ci j1 i\ j 1 2 3 1 ([7,9], [6,10]) ([10,11], [8,12]) ([11,13], [10,12]) 2 ([6,8], [5,9]) ([9,10], [7,11]) ([5,7], [4,8]) 3 ([8,10], [7,11]) ([13,15], [12,16]) ([8,10], [7,11]) ([11, 13], [10, 14]), bu 1 = ([16, 18], [15, 19]), bl 2 = ([24, 26], [23, 27]), bu 2 = ([27, 28], [25, 30]), bl 3 = ([19, 20], [18, 21]), bu 3 = ([23, 24], [22, 26]). Capacities of each type of conveyances are q1 = 2.45 and q2 = 3.78. For convenience, let additional cost for unit de cit amount be ui jk = 0.8 ci jk. The nominal quality (or purity) of product available from each supplier are given by p1 = 0.9 (i.e., 90% purity), p2 = 0.8, p3 = 0.9 and the minimum qualities required at each of the three destinations (consumer) are pmin 1 = 0.85, pmin 2 = 0.85 and pmin 3 = 0.9. Now to solve the proposed rough CCP problem, as formu- lated in (14) (22), with trust level = 0.9 for the objective function and l i = u i = l j = u j = 0.9, i, j = 1, 2, 3 for the respective constraints, we have corresponding determin- istic form using (32) (39), given below: Min Z (40) s.t. 3  i=1 2  k=1 (pi pmin j )xi jk 0, j = 1, 2, 3, (41) 3  j=1 2  k=1 xi jk Fau i , i = 1, 2, 3, (42) 3  j=1 2  k=1 xi jk Fal i , i = 1, 2, 3, (43) 3  i=1 2  k=1 xi jk Fbl j , j = 1, 2, 3, (44) 3  i=1 2  k=1 xi jk Fbu j , j = 1, 2, 3, (45) xi jk zi jk qk, i = 1, 2, 3; j = 1, 2, 3; k = 1, 2, (46) xi jk 0, zi jk N0 i, j, k, (47) Table 2 Unit transportation costs ci j2 i\ j 1 2 3 1 ([10,12], [9,13]) ([8,10], [7,11]) ([12,14], [11,15]) 2 ([11,12], [9,13]) ([6,8], [5,9]) ([9,10], [7,11]) 3 ([11,12], [10,13]) ([10,11], [9,12]) ([8,9], [7,11]) 123 A solid transportation model with product blending and parameters as rough variables 2305 Table 3 Optimum solution of the problem, de ned in (40) (47) x111 = 7.09, x211 = 3.86, x311 = 4.85, x331 = 2.45, x122 = 15.11, x222 = 11.34, x322 = 18.9, Min Z = 620.4556, z111 = 3, z211 = 2, z311 = 2, z331 = 1, z122 = 4, z222 = 3, z332 = 5 where Z is obtained using (23) as Z = 0.8Z1 + 1.8Z4, if 0.9 ((Z2 Z1)/2(Z4 Z1)); 0.2Z1 + 0.8Z4, if 0.9 ((Z3 + Z4 2Z1)/2(Z4 Z1)); Z1(Z3 Z2)+Z2(Z4 Z1)+1.8(Z3 Z2)(Z4 Z1) (Z3 Z2)+(Z4 Z1) , otherwise.

Solving this problem we get the solution as presented in Table 3. 6 Conclusion and future extension In this paper, we study a solid transportation problem with product blending. The presented model has importance in various ways, as it is applicable for transportation system where full vehicle capacities are to be used for transportation and also blending is a related issue in shipment of the prod- ucts. The rough chance-constrained programming (RCCP) is formulated to solve this problem, where the parameters are used as rough variables. There is a lack of appropriate method in the literature to deal with constraints involving rough vari- ables. The presented RCCP model can also be applied to solve many others decision making problems, like inventory control, supply chain, etc. In problem formulation, we consider a single product having single attribute. Practically, there could be multiple products each with multiple attributes (e.g., purity, concen- tration levels, etc.) making the demands for multiple products with multiple qualities. Thus, the presented problem can be extended to a multi-item shipment problem with products having multiple attributes.
