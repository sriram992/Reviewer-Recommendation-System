Extremely 19 intense rainfall event of A.D. 2013 (between 15 and 17 June) kicked off mammoth flash floods in 20 the Kedarnath area of Uttarakhand state, resulting in huge socioeconomic losses to the state and 21 country.

We also examined temporal variance in interrelationships among regional meteorological 30 data (temperature and precipitation) and key global climate variability indices using advance 31 statistical methods. Major findings are (i) significant increase in pre-monsoon air temperature 32 over Uttarakhand after 1997, (ii) increasing upward trend in June-July rainfall and its 33 relationship with regional May temperatures (iii) monsoonal rainfall (June, July, August, and 34 September; JJAS) showing covariance with interannual variability in Eurasian snow cover (ESC) 35 extent during the month of March, and (iv) enhancing tendency of anomalous high rainfall 36 events during negative phases of Arctic Oscillation. Obtained results indicate that under warming 37 scenario, JJ rainfall (over AS) may further increase with occasional extreme rainfall spells when 38 AO index (March) is negative. 39 40 Keywords: Himalayas; flash floods; Arctic Oscillation; extreme rainfall events 41 42 1. Introduction 43 The Indo-Himalayan region from northwest to northeast (Kashmir to Assam) acts as a 44 barrier for ascending moisture-laden clouds that are advecting northward with the seasonal 45 northward movement of Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) during boreal summer. This 46 3 brings summer monsoon precipitation over all mountainous, Himalayan foothills and plain 47 regions of India, Pakistan, Nepal, Bangladesh, and Myanmar. In Northwest Himalayan region 48 Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and Uttarakhand (UKS) are three major hilly regions that are 49 characterised by several mountain peaks, valleys, glaciers, rivers, and thick forest cover 50 supporting a large biodiversity. Among the three northwest Himalayan states, UKS has special 51 importance for having several sacred shrines and tourist spots that are visited by a number of 52 pilgrims / tourists every year during summer. The period of famous holy pilgrimage (the Char 53 dham yatra) overlaps with the early summer monsoon period as typically summer monsoon 54 rainfall may arrive over UKS from second to third week of June, gripping the entire state by mid 55 of July. The source of moisture during summer monsoon precipitation is mainly from the Bay of 56 Bengal but in certain cases moisture from the Arabian Sea can also contribute (Sengupta and 57 Sarkar, 2006). 58 The entire Indo-Himalayan region appears to be experiencing extreme rainfall events 59 more frequently, and several of them have led massive flash floods and landslides (Mishra and 60 Srinivasan, 2013; Chevuturi and Dimri, 2015; Dobhal et al., 2013; Dimri et al., 2016). Flood 61 events occurring in parts of Pakistan, Leh-Laddakh, Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and UKS 62 during 2010, 2013, 2014, and 2016 support the aforesaid developing scenario (Bharti et al., 63 2015). Among the three northwest Himalayan states (Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, and UKS), 64 UKS appears to receive relatively higher frequency of extreme rainfall events compared to 65 others. The extraordinary intense three day long rainfall event of 2013 (between 15 - 17 June) 66 was extensive on spatial and temporal scales covering a vast region compared to other cloudburst 67 events (e.g. over Leh in 2010). In terms of human casualities, the 2013 extreme rainfall of UKS 68 ranks fifth among all the natural calamities that have occurred between 1990 and 2016 69 4 (http:www.embat.be). In addition, Manali (Himachal Pradesh) and Rudrarayag (UKS) also 70 witnessed localized cloudburst events during July 2011 and September 2012 (Chevuturi and 71 Dimri, 2015). Socioeconomic impact of 2013 Kedarnath event is summarized in Ziegler et al. 72 (2014). This single event was responsible for excess rainfall ~137% for northwest India and 73 ~402% for the UKS region (source: IMD press release, 20 June 2013). 74 Chevuturi and Dimri (2015) reported the contribution of voluminous moisture from 75 Arabian Sea that travelled via Bay of Bengal and reached UKS during intense rainfall episode of 76 15-17 June 2013, using backward wind trajectories and satellite imagery of clouds. The 77 aforementioned scenario is in contrast with monsoonal studies conducted for India indicating a 78 plausible weakening of Indian summer monsoon rainfall in general ( Dash et al., 2009; Roxy et 79 al., 2015) amidst the concurrent global warming scenario. For the core monsoon region, 80 Goswami et al. (2006) reported an increase in extreme rain fall events in concurrent warming 81 scenario and De et al. (2005) presented a review of extreme weather events in India in the last 82 100 years. Dash et al. (2007) reported a decreasing tendency in the summer monsoon rainfall 83 over Indian landmass but also an increasing trend in rainfall during pre- and post-monsoon 84 periods. Hence, how summer monsoon in general (as well as at specific locales like UKS) would 85 behave in a changing climate scenario is an intensely debated research topic that emerged in 86 context of global change (Kitoh et al., 2013). Earlier for the northwest Himalaya region also, 87 Basistha et al. (2009) reported a declining trend in monsoonal rainfall from 1965 to 1980. 88 Nonetheless, the recurrence of anomalously high rainfall events over the entire northwest 89 Himalayas, specifically over UKS in recent years has attracted monsoon meteorologists/ climate 90 researchers to investigate causal mechanism(s) leading to development of such events through 91 numerical simulation and modelling (e.g. Dube et al., 2014; Chevuturi and Dimri, 2015; Joseph 92 5 et al., 2015; Dimri et al., 2016;; Cho et al., 2016). In the wake of the concurrent anthropogenic 93 climate change debate a deeper understanding of mechanistic links, causal mechanisms, and 94 alignment of different forcing factors are desired to gauge the vulnerability of mountainous 95 regions of northwestern Himalayas against global warming (Bharti et al., 2016). Apparently 96 UKS seems to be a very sensitive region where rising temperatures, changing monsoonal 97 conditions, glacier melting and regional geomorphology appear to be interacting at a rapid pace 98 (IPCC, 2012). Paleostudies (Srivastava et al., 2013) have reported formation and growth of 99 several glacial lakes, which may burst in an anomalously high rainfall event during the warmer 100 and wetter phase of monsoonal climate. Probability of any such future event in the UKS region 101 will depend on alignment of various forcing factors that eventually lead to higher surface runoff. 102 In addition to meteorological variables, rapidly changing surface features such as land use/ land 103 cover pattern, orography, forest cover, etc., make the region more vulnerable for natural disasters 104 (O Gorman, 2015; Cho et al., 2016; Dimri et al., 2016). India as a whole is experiencing 105 ascendance in warming trend since 1990s (Attri and Tyagi, 2010). How this warming will impact 106 regional precipitation patterns is a major question being debated among policy makers, stake 107 holders, and the scientific community to make the general public aware (Yaduvanshi and 108 Ranade, 2015). In addition, land use and land cover (LU/LC) changes, rapid urbanization, and 109 unplanned settlement specifically over river floodplains of famous holy rivers of UKS have been 110 recognized as important factors for making this hilly terrain much more vulnerable against 111 rainfall event of even mild intensity (Dobhal et al., 2013; Uniyal, 2013; Ziegler et al., 2014). 112 Hence, in the backdrop of aforementioned extreme rainfall events occurring quite 113 regularly over UKS, we revisit here monthly time series data for ambient temperature and 114 precipitation in tandem with some other key global climate indices. Our study probes monthly 115 6 series of rainfall and ambient temperature data covering the last century (1901-2013 for rainfall 116 and 1901 to 2010 for ambient temperatures). We also investigate interannual variability of 117 Eurasian snow cover (ESC) extent data and Arctic Oscillation (AO) index. Using advance 118 statistical methods we examine significant changes in the natural course of variability in 119 aforementioned indices, changes in interrelationships among various parameters for probable 120 reasons. Major findings of our study from the UKS region are (i) enhanced ambient temperatures 121 during pre-monsoon (MAM) from 1997 onward, indicating a significant change; (ii) increasing 122 June-July rainfall over that in August-September in recent years; (iii) ambient temperatures 123 during May showing correlating patterns with regional JJ rainfall; and (iv) interannual variability 124 in JJAS rainfall anomalies over UKS shows correlation with ESC extent (during March) and 125 negative AO index (during March). Results of this study could be exploited by climate/monsoon 126 meteorologists for forecasting and now-casting of anomalous rainfall events in the region, which 127 can greatly enhance the preparedness to minimize socioeconomic impacts of such abnormal 128 meteorological events. 129 130 2. Study area and climatology of the region 131 The UKS is characterised by heterogeneous topography and variable land use/ land 132 cover. The region is source of major north Indian rivers, viz. Alaknanda-Mandakini (the original 133 tributaries of the Ganges and the Yamuna) and other major tributaries. At the subregional spatial 134 scale, it is divided into two prominent regimes of Garhwal and Kumaun Himalayas. Rainfall over 135 the region is highly variable because of orographic forcings, interactions among various forcing 136 factors (viz. westerly winds, monsoonal winds originating from Bay of Bengal/ Arabian Sea; 137 Bhutiyani et al., 2010). In addition, remote forcing factors such as snow cover at higher reaches 138 7 of Himalayas/ Eurasia, El-Ni o Southern Oscillation (ENSO), position of intertropical 139 Convergence Zone (ITCZ) along the foothills of the Himalayas, etc., could also play a 140 determining role for the net monsoonal rainfall over UKS (Basishtha et al., 2009). Owing to 141 complex interactions of wind systems over UKS, any subtle change in one (or more) of the 142 forcing factor(s) can significantly change rainfall distribution/ pattern. Local demographic 143 changes owing to increasing development, tourist activities, and warming of the planet earth in 144 general, could potentially alter normal climatology (monsoonal meteorology) of this 145 mountainous region, and hence the region is being carefully monitored periodically using 146 satellite-derived data (e.g. Mishra and Choudhary, 2015; Bharti et al., 2016). 147 148 3. Data 149 Much of previous research has attempted to analyse time series of rainfall and ambient 150 temperatures to trace out variability in trends and underlying mechanism(s) responsible for 151 abrupt or extreme rainfall events, but rarely have they included northwest Himalaya. Major 152 reasons for this limitation are (i) paucity of spatially distributed rain gauge network-based long- 153 term meteorological rainfall (at least ~100 years long) and (ii) sparsely located rain gauges and 154 automatic weather stations. Long-term time series data are available for a few locations such as 155 Mukteshwar (29.47 N, 79.64 E). However, utility of location-specific data for obtaining a 156 synoptic picture of variability in trends representing perturbation in a regional climatic system is 157 questionable owing to highly variable orography and heterogeneity in the land use/land cover. 158 Advent of satellites (especially meteorological satellites) has provided a useful tool for remotely 159 sensed rainfall over a larger scale including high elevations of northwest Himalaya (Bharti et al., 160 2016). Gridded data sets can provide more representative time series data of northwest 161 8 Himalayan states such as UKS, if gridded time series data can be calibrated with a point location 162 from where similarly long enough rain gauge/weather station data are available. To evaluate 163 secular changes in air temperature and rainfall over UKS for the last century, we used here 164 gridded data of monthly rainfall for a 2.5 2.5 size grid (28.75 N, 31.25 N; 78.75 E, 81.25 E) 165 obtained from Global Precipitation Climatology Project (GPCP; Adler et al., 2003), covering 166 almost the entire UKS region (Fig. 1). Monthly air temperature data time series (at ~2 m height 167 above ground) was obtained for a grid size (28 -32 N and 78 -82 E) from the National Center 168 for Environmental Prediction 20th Century ReanalysisV2 (NCEP; Compo et al., 2011). As these 169 two data sets (temperature and precipitation) are at different resolutions, hence there is slight 170 difference in respective grid locations. Rainfall occurring during May, June, July, August, and 171 September (MJJAS) and ambient air temperatures for March, April and May (MAM) are 172 considered for this study. 173 The gridded reanalysis monthly data for rainfall and ambient temperatures were validated 174 with the corresponding in situ observations at Mukteshwar obtained from the KNMI Climate 175 Explorer (http://climexp.knmi.nl). We can be see that gridded reanalysis reliably represents 176 subregional scale variations (Fig. 2). Figure 2 reveals correlation between the two data sets is 177 0.75 (P < 0.001) for the period 1901-1996 and 0.68 (P < 0.001) for full data span i.e. 1901-2013; 178 hence similar patterns of variability in temporal scale validate the utility of gridded data for 179 investigating variability in trends. 180 The plausible role of Eurasian snow cover (ESC) extent (during winter/spring) impacting 181 the forthcoming Indian summer monsoonal rainfall is an old debate (Blanford, 1884). In contrast, 182 no significant correlation was found between the Himalayan snow cover and subsequent 183 monsoon rainfall. Blanford s hypothesis was questioned by several monsoon researchers later on 184 9 and it appeared that the snow pattern association with the Indian monsoon rainfall is not 185 homogeneously distributed on a spatial scale (Peings and Douville, 2009). Using the satellite 186 observations and estimated ESC extent data, several studies reinvestigated aforesaid 187 relationships, indicating a positive (negative) anomaly of snow cover over Eurasia or some parts 188 of Eurasia is followed by an anomalous weak (strong) monsoon in the summer. However, these 189 studies also indicated large heterogeneity in a spatiotemporal scale exists between snow-rainfall 190 relationships. We therefore attempted to probe interrelationship between regional rainfall and 191 temperature over UKS and ESC extent data using their time series datasets. Interannual ESC data 192 (during the month of March) between 1922 and 1997 were collated with data available between 193 1967 and 2013 (Brown and Robinson et al., 2011). From these, a composite time series of ESC 194 extent for the period 1922 2013 was constructed (Fig. 7A). 195 Joseph et al. (2014) recently examined the role of extratropical forcing factors triggering 196 mechanism behind the mid-June extreme rainfall event (2013) and noted role of another global 197 climate variability indicator Arctic Oscillation (AO). During the negative AO anomaly over the 198 Arctic Circle, cold air intrusion is known to trigger wet spells in a humid (moisture laden) 199 atmosphere (Li and Fu, 2006). According to them, cold air intrusion from the top may generate 200 an anticyclonic flow, which in turn may increase the buoyancy of lower troposphere and 201 destabilize its potential to hold the moisture laden clouds. As the negative AO anomaly (sluggish 202 air circulation over the Arctic region that spread cold air waves to mid-latitudes) shows 203 interannual variability, we examined rainfall time series data over UKS in the realm of the time 204 series AO index data (of March) to probe any systematic change in trend ? The monthly AO 205 index data (March) for the period 1950 2014 were obtained from the NOAA repository (Fig. 206 8A; source: 207 10 http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/precip/CWlink/daily_ao_index/monthly.ao.index.b50.cu 208 rrent.ascii.table). 209 210 4. Analyses and results 211 In order to check validity of rainfall time series for the selected grid (Fig. 1), we 212 compared monthly rainfall (MJJAS) and ambient temperature (MAM) time series data with those 213 available for the Mukteshwar town of Uttarakhand (Fig. 2). Statistical significances of observed 214 correlations are mentioned in respective panels. Despite having some discrepancies especially for 215 a higher altitude region (>3000 m) satellite-derived rainfall estimates appear to be more reliable 216 for studying synoptic and secular trends (compare to point-source-based rain gauge data; Bharti 217 et al., 2016). Especially for complete coverage over mountainous regions and sparsely populated 218 areas where rain gauge and automatic weather station maintenance possess logistical issues, 219 satellite-derived rainfall can provide crucial clues for identifying a developing hazard-prone 220 atmospheric pattern originating from mutually competing meteorological processes. We discuss 221 obtained results about recent changes in ambient temperatures during the pre-monsoon period 222 and monthly distribution of summer monsoon rainfall over the UKS in the last ~100-year period 223 in following subsections. 224 4.1 Ambient surface temperatures over UKS in the recent past 225 Figure 1 shows the location of the selected grid on the map of India. The selected grid 226 covers most parts of UKS including the Kedarnath area where an extreme rainfall event occurred 227 during mid-June 2013. The location of Mukteshwar town in UKS for which long-term rainfall 228 and temperature data are available for comparison. Frequency of extreme weather events over 229 the northwestern Himalaya have been reported to have increased in recent decades (International 230 11 Disaster Database, http://www.emdat.be), most likely owing to increase in intensification of 231 global monsoon in response to the last three decades of general global warming (Wang et al., 232 2012; Bharti et al., 2016). Extreme rainfall events leading to heavy flash floods (e.g., 2010 and 233 2013 in the Leh-Ladakh region and over the Kedarnath region, respectively) might have these 234 triggering forcings somewhere in the web of being mutually competing teleconnected climate- 235 forcing factors, but do elevated surface temperatures have a facilitating role in it ? That is the 236 fundamental question being debated. To address this important question we investigated ambient 237 air temperatures during the pre-monsoon period (MAM; Fig.1), which show a conspicuous 238 upward rising trend from the year 1997 onward. Notably, surface temperatures before 1997 239 (from 1950) show a declining trend during the same pre-monsoon season. The change in annual 240 MAM ambient temperature data was validated through the Sample T statistical test using SPSS 241 software. Data were divided into two groups: group 1 belonging to MAM data from 1997 to 242 2010, whereas group 2 represents the MAM data from 1901 to 1996. Group 1 and 2 were found 243 to be statistically different using the non-parametric Mann-Whitney test (null hypothesis was 244 rejected because P < 0.05). 245 This anomalous rise in the surface temperature over UKS can be seen in the all India 246 level general warming trend from 1990 onward (Attri and Tyagi, 2010). Notably after achieving 247 separate statehood in 2000, the UKS region has been experiencing faster growth at rural sites and 248 rapid urbanization, tourism, etc., leading to significant changes in land use/land cover with 249 unchecked and unplanned growth. Hence, part of the observed warming in UKS might have been 250 contributed from ongoing anthropogenic activities. Irrespective of the probable causes, this pre- 251 monsoon surface warming can potentially influence the regional rainfall pattern. 252 4.2 Monthly rainfall distribution and interannual variability 253 12 To contemplate rising ambient surface temperature s influence on regional rainfall, we 254 investigated monthly rainfall distribution (MJJAS; Fig. 3) for the selected UKS grid. The vertical 255 (red) line shows data before and after 1997. The June-July rainfall pattern shows an increasing 256 trend compared to rainfall during August September during a recent warming era of UKS (post- 257 1997). Data sets before and after 1997 were subjected to a non-parametric statistical test using 258 SPSS software. Using the Kendall coefficient of concordance for significance (P < 0.10), all 259 monthly time series data and JJ and AS rainfall anomaly data before and after 1997 show 260 significant differences (rejecting null hypothesis). As can be seen from Fig. 3F cumulative 261 monsoonal rainfall (JJAS) shows a significantly increasing trend in the post-1997 warming era. 262 Importantly, the regional rainfall was declining between 1950 to 1980 (Basistha et al., 2009). A 263 steady increase in the September rainfall and possibly its contribution in the cumulative JJAS 264 rainfall over UKS between 1907 and 1926 can be seen (shaded portions in Figs. 3E-F). This 265 observed increase in the early part of 20th century indicate variability in meteorological processes 266 in recent years may not exclusively be attributable to the regional warming trend (Fig. 1) and that 267 causative mechanism(s) governing rainfall distribution might lie in temporally varying 268 teleconnected operative forcing factors also. 269 However, the recent increasing trend of JJAS rainfall over UKS must be investigated in 270 tandem with possible anthropogenic factors. Several reports suggest that pre-monsoon aerosol 271 loading over the north India/Gangetic-Himalayan region could alter normal distribution of 272 rainfall over four months (JJAS). We anticipate that the emerging scenario JJ rainfall may 273 increase while AS months might get drier (Gautam et al., 2009). The observed increasing rainfall 274 trend in JJ months could also be owing to enhanced temperature contrast between Indian 275 landmass and northern Indian Ocean. Interestingly strengthening of sea surface winds over the 276 13 western Arabian Sea during the early summer monsoon phase and surface productivity in the 277 western Arabian Sea are reported to have enhanced since 1997 (Goes et al., 2005). Hence, the 278 apparent increase in subseasonality (rainfall distribution between JJ and AS) during 1997 is 279 noteworthy. At the all-India level, it is shown that during extreme rainfall years (above and 280 below normal monsoon) the difference between JJ and AS rainfall increases (Kothawale and 281 Kulkarni, 2015). Higher JJ rainfall over UKS indicates that enhanced SSTs in the northern Indian 282 Ocean could provide enhanced precipitable moisture toward the northwest Himalayas. Boschat et 283 al. (2012) has investigated SST-Indian summer monsoon teleconnections; however, more 284 intrusive ocean-atmospheric research involving satellite-derived lower atmospheric wind and 285 other meteorological parameters can provide more insights for developing scenario. 286 287 4.3 Monthly rain-rate distribution 288 As we focused on extreme rainfall events over UKS and their temporal variability in this 289 study, ideally daily rainfall time series should be analysed to capture these events, as cumulative 290 monthly rainfall time series data may mask effects of some of the abrupt and anomalous 291 (extreme) rainfall events. In the absence of reliable daily rainfall data for a long period (last 292 ~100 years) for the region, rain-rate data analyses could be a good substitute for examining 293 sharp variability. Therefore, in addition to monthly distribution of cumulative rainfall, we also 294 investigated satellite-derived monthly rain-rate (mm.day-1) data for the UKS grid available from 295 1986 to 2015 (Fig. 4). Data source is GPCC (Adler et al., 2003). Rain-rate is radar-based rain 296 probability between no rain and a log-normal distribution for a rain event (Adler et al., 2003). 297 Notably here also, we can see that monthly rain-rate data of June, July and August show 298 significant changes before and after 1997, indicating that concurrent warming over the hilly 299 14 terrain of UKS appears to be impacting monsoonal strength overall. Daily precipitation 300 rate data show that annual rainfall has actually marginally decreased from 1990 to 2015 (data not 301 shown), but frequency of anomalous rainfall events has increased. Local orographic and regional 302 climate variables, e.g., enhanced ambient surface temperatures, would certainly have their 303 influence; in addition, remote forcing factors (discussed later in detail) appear to collectively 304 contribute intensity of extreme rainfall events. Monthly rain-rate data before and after 1997 fall 305 into two statistically different groups; and it was validated using independent sample null 306 hypothesis testing via SPSS software. 307 308 4.4 May temperature and JJ rainfall relationship 309 We investigated relationships between monthly temperatures (March, April, and May) 310 with JJ rainfall time series. Figure 5 shows the May temperatures correlative pattern with JJ 311 rainfall over UKS. Two time series data sets show a temporally variable covariance, which 312 appears to be weakening in the last one and a half decade (post-1997; Fig. 5A). Overall spring 313 and pre-monsoon (MAM) temperatures of UKS also appear to show a temporally varying 314 relationship with regional JJ rainfall (Fig. 5B), but again with a noteworthy widening gap during 315 the post-1997 warming era. We surmise that enhanced regional warming may influence regional 316 rainfall with a possibility of uneven distribution of summer monsoon (JJAS) rainfall. Rather than 317 computing pre- and post- 1997 linear correlation coefficients, we examined here running 318 correlations and the trends of the correlation coefficients of JJ rainfall with May and MAM 319 temperature time series data. A moving 11-year sliding window was selected to see a statistically 320 significant correlation coefficient (only r 0.5 correlations are statistically significant). Figure 321 5C reveals temporally nonstationary inter-relationship between pre-monsoon temperatures and JJ 322 15 rainfall. Although statistical significance is weak, we note a deteriorating relationship between 323 ambient temperature and JJ rainfall in the recent one and a half decade period (post-2000) (Fig. 324 5C). To gain further insights into the temperature-rainfall relationship, we conducted Wavelet 325 coherence analysis (Grinsted et al., 2004) of the JJ rainfall with May temperature that shows 326 temporal changes in the coherency in frequency domain (Fig. 6). Figure 6 shows the two 327 timeseries are coherent at decadal timescales between mid-1930 s and 1970, while between 1980 328 and 2000 they were coherent at decadal and subdecadal time-scales. The linear correlation and 329 the coherencies have become insignificant in the twenty-first century. Taken together, these 330 observations indicate rising regional temperatures especially in the month of May influencing 331 regional JJ rainfall. Warmer air might be lifting up mineral dust aerosols from the valley region 332 to the tropospheric heights, and thus the possible role played by ambient aerosols just before the 333 onset of the summer monsoon over northwest Himalayas cannot be ruled out as one of the 334 plausible causes responsible for more frequent extreme rainfall events in the region. 335 336 4.5 Remote forcing factors and monsoonal rainfall over UKS 337 The weakening relationship between pre-monsoon surface temperatures and monthly 338 rainfall (JJAS) over UKS during recent warming era (post-1997) indicates the possibility that a 339 regional tropospheric wind circulation pattern has started to realign itself, and during this time 340 regional meteorology may become more vulnerable against global climate variables. Regional 341 summer monsoon rainfall especially during its early part (i.e. June-July rainfall) witnessing more 342 frequent extreme rainfall events hint such a plausible scenario. Because of variable altitudinal 343 heights and highly variable regional orography, subtle changes in any of atmospheric processes 344 responsible for monsoonal rainfall can get substantially magnified. To assess the emerging 345 16 meteorological scenario over UKS and other northern parts of the northwest Himalayas, a closer 346 watch on various wind and cloud parameters by ground-based monitoring systems as well as 347 using satellite observations is necessary to pre-empt extreme rainfall events. This effort can 348 greatly help to manage future rainfall-related natural hazards. 349 Though several remote factors may be held responsible for aforesaid increasing 350 vulnerability, we focused here on two remote forcing factors: (i) ESC extent and (ii) AO index 351 (Gong et al., 2003; Dash et al., 2004; Joesph et al., 2014). Figure 7A shows monsoonal rainfall 352 (JJAS) over UKS and its relationships with spring time snow cover (i.e. ESC extent over Eurasia 353 during March). Temperature contrast between Indian landmass and the northern Indian Ocean is 354 known to be modulated by ESC extent. Figure 7A shows the persisting relationship between 355 monsoonal rainfall (JJAS) over UKS and ESC extent during March. Temporal varying 356 correlation coefficients (Fig. 7B) indicate a plausible lead-lag relationship between the two time 357 series. Nonetheless, Figure 7A reveals ESC extent (March) could be treated as one of the key 358 forcing factors influencing UKS monsoonal rainfall and notably the relationship does not seem 359 to have been affected after the 1997 warming. Another important point to note here is that JJAS 360 rainfall anomalies over UKS appear to be positively correlated with ESC extent, i.e. positive 361 (negative) ESC extent year witnessing above (below) normal rainfall over UKS. This 362 observation is intriguing as rising global temperatures are supposed to decrease ESC extent and 363 thereby favour below-normal rainfall over UKS. However, apparently regional rainfall appears 364 to be rising, especially during early months. Snow cover extent during spring over a more 365 specific region of Eurasia might serve as a better antecedent for predicting rainfall over UKS. 366 Several recent studies investigated sequence of atmospheric (meteorological) processes 367 that led to the extreme rainfall event of 15 17 June 2013 (Joseph et al. 2014; Dimri et al., 2016). 368 17 Joseph et al. (2014) reported fast advancement of a monsoon front over UKS and interaction 369 between the monsoonal low pressure system and the mid-latitude atmospheric system plausibly 370 originated from the Arctic region (negative AO anomaly) that helped the early advancement of 371 monsoon and the generation of the heavy rainfall event aided by orographic uplift. We pose a 372 question here: do negative and positive AO anomalies over Arctic region have an influence on 373 extreme rainfall events over UKS ? . In order to check this, we investigated AO index time 374 series data available from 1950 (source: NOAA) in the realm of a JJAS rainfall anomaly over 375 UKS. Figure 8A shows a noticeable concurrence of negative AO anomalies with positive JJAS 376 rainfall anomalies over UKS. The strength of concurrence between the two could be adjudged by 377 computing likelihood of co-occurrence of a negative AO anomaly and above average rainfall 378 over UKS. Analyzing the two anomalies bin wise, apparently the negative AO anomaly over 379 Arctic region (can be checked in month of March probably) will be followed by an above-normal 380 summer monsoon rainfall over UKS, which appears to be increasing in recent years (Fig. 8B). 381 Notably probabilities are 0.3 (Figure 8b), which essentially means that only ~30% chances are 382 there when negative AO anomaly over Arctic may be followed by anomalous rainfall over UKS. 383 But, as the year 2013 witnessed a negative AO anomaly over the Arctic and an extreme rainfall 384 event in UKS (Joseph et al., 2014), negative AO anomalies must be carefully monitored for their 385 plausible impact over northern landmass (Europe and north America) as well as higher 386 Himalayas. A strong negative AO in 2009 was followed by anomalously higher rainfall over 387 UKS in 2010 and the Leh-Ladhakh cloud burst event. 388 389 5 Conclusions 390 18 We attempted to present a simple layout to assess changing patterns of regional summer 391 monsoon rainfall (its intensity and distribution) over orographically variable terrain of 392 Uttarakhand. Results obtained in this study could be utilized by climate/monsoon modellers and 393 policy makers for better assessment of rainfall related natural hazards over the hilly states of 394 India. To comprehend with the rapidly changing meteorological and hydrology of UKS, there is 395 a strong need for setting up ground-based instruments capable of monitoring various climate 396 parameters. These observations coupled with satellite observations can greatly help our 397 preparedness to meet future rainfall-related hazards by preempting them well in advance and 398 evacuating tourists and pilgrims by issuance of hazard warnings. We must note that rapidly 399 changing regional geomorphology (in response to anthropogenic activities such as urbanization, 400 tourism, etc.) may enhance impacts of rainfall- and snowfall- related extreme events in terms of 401 human lives and infrastructure loss. Hence, in addition to monitoring atmospheric processes, and 402 satellite-derived monitoring of surface topographical features such as slope, relief, aspect, and 403 geometry of major touristd spots also should be monitored in order to assess their vulnerability 404 against human and climatic stress. Use of multi-dimensional surface-atmospheric column data 405 could be exploited to build computer-based models to assess potential regions of vulnerability 406 with possibility of predicting an epicentre well in advance to minimize disaster. 407 Major outcomes of our study can be summarized as follows: 408 Abrupt increase in pre-monsoon air temperatures after 1997. 409 Statistically significant upward trends in June-July rainfall compared to rainfall in August 410 September. 411 Temporal varying relationship between ambient air temperatures (spring to pre-monsoon) 412 and JJ rainfall over UKS. 413 19 ESC extent (March) and AO index (March) appear to influence JJAS rainfall over UKS; 414 however, their quantitative impacts are yet to be estimated. 415 416 Acknowledgements 417 RA thanks Director BSIP, Lucknow and CSIR-NPL, New Delhi for facilities.
