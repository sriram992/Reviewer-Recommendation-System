Intertwining of Communities, Core and Periphery in Complex Networks Saisujay Masina, Sathvik Nimmaneni, Navaneeth Gatttagoni, Yayati Gupta, Sanatan Sukhija Mahindra University, Ecole Centrale School of Engineering Hyderabad, India Abstract Meso-scale structures, like communities and core- periphery, have been extensively studied in complex networks. However, their coexistence and collective dynamics are not well understood. Communities represent dense connections between a set of nodes. On the other hand, the core of a network encompasses the influential nodes (superspreaders). It is not well understood whether a community comprises equally influential nodes or nodes from a spectrum of influential powers. We propose various metrics to quantify the influence composition of communities in a network. Shell number (aka coreness: maximal core number of a node), calculated using K-shell decomposition algorithm, has been used as an indicator of influence. We also quantify the influential power of a community as a whole. Most of the communities, specifically influential communities, are ob- served to possess varying levels of influence. k-shell decomposition has also been applied to the induced subgraph of communities to unravel local cores. Thereafter, the overlap between local and global cores is studied. One of the significant findings is the dense presence of core nodes in only a few communities. Further, it is seen that globally influential nodes are mostly locally influential as well. However, the reverse may or may not be true.

INTRODUCTION Graph theory provides a powerful way to study complex systems of interacting objects. The properties and organizing principles of such networks have received considerable atten- tion for a long time. One of the major organising principles in such networks is homophily. Illustrated by the quotes like Like attracts like and Birds of a feather flock together , homophily implies that similar people (entities) are often seen as friends (connected with an edge) in a network. As illustrated in Figure 1a, homophily leads to the formation of dense communities [3] in a loosely connected network. Such dense communities allow easy information diffusion within them. However, difficulty in inter-community information diffusion leads to trapping of information within communities. It hap- pens [2] because of a minimal number of inter-community links (weak ties). Another popular organising principle is preferential attach- ment. Quoted as rich gets richer [4], it means that persons having many friends tend to attract more friends. Further, such popular persons tend to be densely connected with each other. But unlike communities, they are also strongly connected to the remaining network. This leads to the formation of core- periphery structure [5] in a network (refer Figure 1b). It has been shown that the persons located in the core of a network tend to be the super-spreaders [6] of information. There have been independent studies depicting communities trapping the information and core superspreading it. However, in the real world, these forces coexist during information diffusion. To understand the unified impact of these meso- scale structures in information diffusion, it is essential to understand their structural co-existence. In this paper, we define a number of metrics to understand the intertwining between these mesoscale structures in a network. The major contributions of our work are 1) Quantifying the influence of nodes in a network in terms of spreading power and spreading time 2) Proposing a number of metrics to quantify the influential power of communities in a network 3) Understanding the composition of communities in terms of the influence of participating nodes The rest of the paper is organised as following. Section II highlights the literature. Section III briefly introduces the necessary background. Section IV to VII proposes a number of metrics to quantify the coexistence of two mesoscales structure in networks. Each of these sections consist of its own methodology, experiments and results. The paper is concluded in section VIII. II. LITERATURE REVIEW The presence of mesoscale structures is observed in most of the real world networks, including social networks. Two of these most prominent structures are the community and core periphery structures. It has also been shown that the scale free networks tend to have a core periphery structure [5], [6]. These structures affect the pattern of information propagation over these social networks. Communities have been widely observed in real world networks. A number of approaches have been proposed to identify the commu- nities in the network. The seminal work in the direction of a meme virality by Weng et al. [2] emphasizes that the existence of a meme in multiple communities is a signal of a meme getting viral. Another important work by Kitsak et al. [6] proved that there is a dense core at the center of every social network. Once a meme infects a core node, it spreads through the whole of the network. Understanding the spreading of information in different social, biological and economic networks is a problem of high significance. It has been seen that the influence of nodes in a network varies 2022 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI) 978-1-6654-7941-7/22/$31.00 2022 IEEE 89 2022 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI) | 978-1-6654-7941-7/22/$31.00 2022 IEEE | DOI: 10.1109/ICETCI55171.2022.9921384 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

Hence, the identification of such influential nodes remains a major research problem which can help in superspreading/controlling the diffusion of information/diseases in various social, biological and technical networks. One widely accepted algorithm for determining such influential nodes is k-shell decomposition. It has been used in diverse applications like finding central proteins in PPI (Protein-Protein Interaction) networks, identifying drug targets, understanding mutation rates [7], text visualisation and summarization [8], real-time keyword extraction from conversations [9], corporate networks, banking networks etc. The algorithm is computationally efficient, having a run time complexity of O(|V |+|E|) where |V | is the number of nodes and |E| is the number of edges in the network, respectively. The objective of our work is to study the unified impact of both the above mentioned meso-scale structures on network dynamics. Xiang et al. [10] proposed a single algorithm to predict both the structures. Various theoretical models for the co-existence of these structures have also been proposed. However, our work aims more at uncovering the relation between these structures in real world networks. III. PRELIMINARIES A. Core-periphery structure The core-periphery structure (refer figure 2a) is a mesoscale network structure, where the network has two types of nodes. The first is a cohesive group of densely connected nodes called core nodes, and the second is nodes that are sparsely connected among themselves, called periphery nodes. We use the k-shell decomposition algorithm to find the core shell in the network. In this algorithm, we recursively remove all the nodes with degree k in the network till no k degree nodes in the network are left and bucket them into the kth shell. We repeat this process for all the values of k (i.e., k = Figure 2: Adjacency matrices of idealized block models. (a) community structure, (b) Core Periphery structure, (c) multiple communities in a core periphery structure (d) multiple core periphery structures in a community. 1, 2, . . . n) or till the graph becomes empty. At the last iteration of this process, we will get our core shell. B. Community structure It is a type of mesoscale structure network in which a set of nodes are densely connected among themselves. Many algorithms have been proposed to detect such communities (refer figure 2b) automatically. There are many algorithms to detect a community structure in a network. In a network with adjacency matrix A and m number of nodes, modularity computed as s X i=1 X i Cl,j Cl Ai,j KiKj 2m , is used to find the relevance of the community structure. Ki represents the degree of the node i. In our work, We used the multilevel community detection algorithm because of its high modularity. Multilevel community detection algorithm modularity values of the networks can be seen in Table 1. 2022 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI) 90 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

IV. INFORMATION DIFFUSION DYNAMICS A. Cascade Size and Time Information diffusion in a network is dependent on a plethora of factors. One of the most important and highly researched factor is the set of seed nodes. The choice of the seed set highly impacts the size of the resultant cascade as well as the time taken in the diffusion process. Let G(v, E) represent a network where V (G) and E(G) represent the set of nodes and edges respectively. The cascade size and the time resulting from a seed set, S V (G), are denoted by (S) and (S) respectively. Let u represent the shell number of a node u V (G). Also, let Gc be the induced subgraph (Vc, Ec) G(V, E) for a given shell number c, where, Vc = {u : u V (G), u = c} and Ec = {(u, v) : (u, v) E(G), u Vc, v Ec} . We define the average influential power of a shell Gc as (Gc) = 1 |Vc| X u Vc ({u}) . Similarly, we define the average influence time of Gc as (Gc) = 1 |Vc| X u Vc ({u}) (Gc) and (Gc) for various shells in an induced subgraph of Facebook network are shown in Figure 3. As expected, the nodes in innermost shell have the highest cascading power1. Such nodes comprise the core of the network. Definition 1. Core (GR): It is the induced subgraph on set of nodes comprising the innermost shell of the network. GR(V R, ER) G(V, E) : R = max({ v : v V (G)}) Figure 3a shows that the cascading power increases ex- ponentially with an increase in shell number. However, it achieves a near maximum value much before reaching R (116 for the Facebook dataset). A similar observation holds true for the cascade time as well (Refer fig ). Based on this observation, we define another induced subgraph, Definition 2. Pseudo Core (GD(V D, ED)): It is the induced subgraph on set of nodes closer to core nodes in terms of influential power. GD = ({Gx(V x, Ex) : 1 x R, (GR) (Gx) < }), where is a very small value. Definition 3. Periphery (GP ): The remaining network, GP = G GR GD, is termed as periphery. The graph subtraction operation (associative) is defined as follows G1(V 1, E1) G2(V 2, E2) = G3(V 3, E3) : V 3 = V 1 V 2, E3 = {(u, v) : u V 3, v V 3} 1The terms influential power , cascading power , influence , and cas- cade size have been used interchangeably in the paper. 2022 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI) 91 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

Top left: S V R, Top Right: S V D, Bottom left: S H5, Bottom Right: S V P . |S| = 5 in all the cases. B. Cascade Growth We further investigate the change in cascade size over time. For detailed observations, we categorize the nodes of the network, G, in several ways as mentioned below. 1) Core nodes: V R(GR) 2) Pseudo core nodes: V D(GD) 3) Periphery nodes: V P (GP ) 4) Hubs (Hk) : Hk represents the set of k highest degree nodes in the network. Considering A to represent the adjacency matrix of the graph G, the degree of a node degu = |{v : v V (G), Auv E(G)}|. Next, we consider the seed set S with |S| = 5. We simulate 4 experiments with S picking random nodes from the above mentioned sets of nodes. We plot the cumulative number of infected nodes in the sets V R, V D, V P and Hk. Figures 4a and 4c show that the cascade grows exponentially from the beginning of the simulation if initiated from core or hubs. On the other hand, if the seed nodes are pseudocores or periphery (refer figures 4b and 4d), the cascade grows exponentially after a brief initial period. Further, in the case of seed nodes being peripheries, the cascade is not complete, i.e., there are nodes in the network which have not adopted the meme. C. Significance of Communities The reason why diffusion initiating from periphery nodes leads to a big cascade in our experiments is the random selection of nodes. Given a large number of periphery nodes in the network, it is highly likely for the seed nodes to be picked from structurally diverse regions (different communities) of 2022 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI) 92 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

Weng et al. have shown that cascades initiating from multiple communities are bigger than those initiating from the nodes in the same community. Hence, to understand the information diffusion process in more depth, it is important to collectively study the two meso-scale structures, i.e., core- periphery structure and community structure. V. QUANTIFYING INFLUENTIAL COMMUNITIES To study the intertwining of the community structure and the core periphery struture, we address the following two questions. Coreness: What fraction of nodes in a given community are core nodes? Core Distribution: What fraction of core nodes are present in a given community? As discussed before in section III, communities are the dense induced subgraphs in a network. If u represents the community index, m, of a node u, then the corresponding community subgraph Gm = (V m, Em), where, V m {v : v V (G), v = m, }, and Em = {(u, v), u V m, v V m}. A. Coreness of a Community For each community, Gm(vm, Em), we determine f(Gm) = |{u : u = m, u R}| |V m| Figure 5: Venn diagram representing the set of nodes V m in a given community Gm and the set of core nodes V R. V G represents the universal set of nodes Based on the venn diagram representation shown in figure 5, f(Gm) can also be expressed as |V R V m| |V m| . Contrary to our expectations, around 60-70% of the core nodes (in the Facebook dataset) belong to a single community. This shows that the core nodes are densely packed in the same community. However, it is important to verify that this observation is not due to the power law distribution of community sizes in real world networks. We observed that there are a number of large communities comprising mainly of the periphery nodes. On the other hand, there are a few large communities which contain most of the core nodes. The experimental results for the three real world networks are reported in figure 6.

For each network, we compare two communities, the largest community in the network G (V , E ) where |V | = max(|V m|, m { u : u V (G)}) and, the community having the largest number of core nodes.

For comparison purposes; if G = G , then we modify G to be the community having the second largest number of core nodes. Figure 6 represents three different behaviours shown by dif- ferent datasets. In the Karate network, the largest community is the most influential one. However, in the Facebook network, it can be clearly seen that the largest community is spread over the initial few shells comprising mostly of the periphery nodes with a few pseudo-core nodes. On the other hand, the most influential community (smaller in size) comprises mostly of the core nodes. f(Gm) = 70% and g(Gm) = 99% for the most influential community in the Facebook network. It is seen that influential communities are often large, but large communities need not be influential. In the Deezer network, both the largest and the most influential communities are dispersed over multiple shells. However, the largest and most influential communities are different. B. Core Distribution in Communities For each community, Gm, we determine the fraction of core nodes present in it as g(Gm) = |{u : u = m, u R}| |V R| Based on the venn diagram representation shown in figure 5, g(Gm) can also be expressed as |V R V m| |V R| . Figure 7 represents the number of nodes in various shells for the largest and most influential communities of various datasets. The largest and the most influential community of the Karate network consist of all peripheral nodes in shell 1 and 60% of nodes from the core. In the Facebook network, the community having the highest coreness also has the highest distribution of core nodes. On the other hand, the largest community contains most of the pseudocore nodes in the network. In the Deezer network, the most influential and the largest communities contains 40% and 30% of the core nodes respectively. In the above experiments, we mainly focused on the core nodes in the largest and most influential communities. Below, we present more generalised results. VI. GENERALISING COMMUNITY CORENESS In most of the literature, community and core-periphery structures are studied separately as two different meso-scale structures. Both the communities as well the core are dense subgraphs in a network. However, the core is more structurally central in a network. In this section, we consider each Gm where m represents the community index. Then, we inde- pendently analyze the influence composition (distribution of various shell numbers) of all communities in the network. For each community Gm, we obtain a vector Xm of shell numbers. Xm = ( u : u V m(Gm)) Next, we compute entropy of a community Gm as H( Xm) = n X i=1 P(xi)logP(xi) where n = |V m| and xi represents ith element of Xm. A high entropy represents a community having nodes of diverse influential powers. On the other hand, a low entropy signifies 2022 International Conference on Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ICETCI) 94 Authorized licensed use limited to: Mahindra University - Hyderabad.

The size of the dot represents the coreness of the community equally influential nodes in a community. Figure 8 shows the entropy values of communities in the Facebook network. It is seen that the most influential communities have high en- tropy. The Facebook community has a high diversity (entropy) in terms of influence of its participating nodes. However, most other influential communities have low entropy values signifying that they are composed mostly of the core nodes. Even though the most influential community has high entropy, the entropy of the largest community in the network is greater. Hence, like to the size, entropy is also not a predictor of the influence of a community. Since most communities comprise a number of nodes other than the core nodes, we generalise the notion of influence as follows. Given a community Gm, its mean influence distribu- tion is defined as ( Xm) as shown below 1 | Xm| X xi Xm xi Figure 9 shows the correlation between the entropy and mean influence of communities in various networks. In general, a positive correlation can be observed. This means that despite having only a few core nodes, communities with higher entropy are more influential. VII. GLOBAL INFLUENCE VS. COMMUNITY INFLUENCE In the previous experiments, our definition of influence for each node was based on the application of k-shell decom- position to the entire network. However, the algorithm can be applied to the induced subgraph Gm representing the mth community in the network. Hence, from now on, we use the term global shell index for u and define another term called local shell index for each node. The local shell index quantifies the influential power of a node within its own community. Local shell number u for a node is computed by applying k-shell decomposition to the community containing the node u. Similar to global core GR, we define local core for a com- munity Gm as Gm Q(V m Q , Em Q ) where Q = max( v : v Gm) and V m Q = {u : u Gm, u = Q} Em Q = {(u, v) : u V m Q , v V m Q } For each community Gm, following metrics can be com- puted. 1) Jaccard coefficient : J(V R, V m Q ) = |V R V m Q | |V R V m Q | 2) Local core fraction: |V m Q | |V m| 3) Global core fraction: |V R V m| |V m| 4) Fraction of the global core in the local core: |V R V m Q | |V m Q | 5) Fraction of the local core in the global core : |V R V m Q | |V R| The results of the above metrics for the Karate network are shown in II. From the data, we were able to draw the following conclusions: VIII. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK Several metrics have been proposed to quantify the compo- sition and influence of communities. It has been shown that the community composition and influence are positively cor- related. The more diverse the influential power of participant nodes, the more influential the community is.
