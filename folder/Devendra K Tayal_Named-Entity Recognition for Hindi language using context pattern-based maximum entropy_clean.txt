Tayal NAMED-ENTITY RECOGNITION FOR HINDI LANGUAGE USING CONTEXT PATTERN-BASED MAXIMUM ENTROPY Abstract This paper describes a named-entity-recognition (NER) system for the Hindi language that uses two methodologies: an existing baseline maximum entropy-based named-entity (BL-MENE) model, and the proposed context pattern-based MENE (CP-MENE) framework. BL-MENE utilizes several base- line features for the NER task but suffers from inaccurate named-entity (NE) boundary detection, misclassification errors, and the partial recognition of NEs due to certain missing essentials. However, the CP-MENE-based NER task incorporates extensive features and patterns that are set to overcome these problems. In fact, CP-MENE s features include right-boundary, left-boundary, part-of-speech, synonym, gazetteer and relative pronoun features. CP-MENE formulates a kind of recursive relationship for extracting highly ranked NE pat- terns that are generated through regular expressions via Python@ code. Since the web content of the Hindi language is arising nowadays (especially in health care applications), this work is conducted on the Hindi health data (HHD) corpus (which is readily available from the Kaggle dataset). Our experiments were conducted on four NE categories; namely, Person (PER), Disease (DIS), Consumable (CNS), and Symptom (SMP).

Tayal 1. Introduction Natural language processing (NLP) [59] serves as an important field in the com- puter science area for analyzing a variety of texts. NLP escalates different fields; for example, information retrieval [6], information extraction (IE) [58], machine transla- tion [89], question answering [90], social media [62,63,66], and so on. Among these, IE is defined as a task for extracting structured information from unstructured or semi- structured text that provides valuable information for users. One of the vital sub-tasks of IE is to identify names or named entities (NEs) within a text and classify them into pre-defined categories like person, location, organization, date, time, etc. The pro- cess of identifying and classifying named entities is generally known as named-entity recognition (NER) [10, 17, 82]. So far, several NER systems have been successfully deployed for varied languages, such as the English [80, 139], French [50, 94], Span- ish [79,130], Greek [2,127], Arabic [3,120], Chinese [16,40], German [57,95], and In- dian languages [1,133]. In addition, NER systems are built for various domains (such as newswire [19, 92], financial [39, 140], clinical [136, 141], biomedical [72, 135], etc.) with the use of various techniques. NER techniques are classified as machine-learning, rule-based, and hybrid techniques. Machine learning-based NER needs a large train- ing corpus and considers models such as maximum entropy [111, 116], expectation maximization [104], perceptron [13], na ve Bayes [132], voted co-training [75], decision tree [131], bootstrapping [103], hidden Markov [88], latent semantic analysis [46], sup- port vector machine [25], conditional random field [60], graph [51], clustering [53], deep learning [81, 138], and many more. The rule-based approach for NER [18, 38, 67, 71] looks into a set of rules that are defined by experts for extracting NEs. Such an ap- proach generates pattern sets that have grammatical, syntactical, and orthographical features along with supported dictionaries. However, the manual computation of the rules is quite labor-intensive and extremely costly, and it requires substantial language and domain expertise. The hybrid approach for NER [60,68,73,86,100] accompanies the combination of two or more NER strategies for a significant improvement in an NER s performance. Research on NER enlightens several well-developed systems for resource-rich lan- guages like English for domain-independent and domain-specific tasks [15,74,85,128] with high scores regarding the evaluation metrics. However, the construction of an NER system for resource-poor Indian languages (such as Hindi) is quite challeng- ing [5,34,61,123,125]. The Hindi language uses the Devanagari script [47], and it is an o icial language of the Indian government (along with English). Hindi is charac- terized by its inflectional and morphological richness and is a su ix-based language. In the present scenario, the emerging demand of smart health applications that are based on the Hindi language trigger health domain-based named entities for Hindi. Some NEs such as disease and symptom do not have well-defined NE nomen- clatures. However, health-related NEs are comprised of long compound words, short abbreviations, wide variations in spelling, and the cascading of one NE into another. In addition, numerous new health NEs continue to evolve, while there is no complete Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 83 dictionary to incorporate health NEs in Hindi. Thus, the NERs in Hindi for the health domain are quite perplexing, which makes it necessary to somehow be solved. In this paper, the Hindi Health Data (HHD) corpus is considered from Kag- gle datasets. An HHD corpus looks for four NE categories; namely, Person (PER), Disease (DIS), Consumable (CNS), and Symptom (SMP) NEs. In order to per- form an NER task on the HHD corpus, a context pattern-based maximum entropy named-entity (CP-MENE) framework is proposed that is an extension of an existing baseline MENE (BL-MEME) [11]. BL-MENE serves as a flexible statistical model that has diversified features without looking into hand-coded patterns for the NER task. Still, some NEs are left out from the corpus due to being partially recognized or mistakenly classified by BL-MENE. This happens because the words in isolation within BL-MENE may contribute to the multi-faceted potential for the meaning of an utterance. To solve this, it is necessary to assign the respective word-sense to the use of contextual patterns and differentiate one sense from another. In order to resolve the NE based misclassification errors, CP-MENE discovers new patterns set and attaches an appropriate meaning to Hindi words using abstract behavior of words. CP-MENE also contains an extension of features such as right-boundary, left- boundary, part-of-speech, synonym, gazetteer, and relative pronoun features for re- solving the NE s boundary-detection errors. Thus, CP-MENE incorporates a baseline MENE, pattern set, and extensive features for handling the NE boundary-detection and its misclassification errors. The performance of BL-MENE is, thus, reclassified by using the CP-MENE, and a significant improvement in the Hindi NER is achieved by using the CP-MENE over other NER approaches (like an ontology-based NER) [64]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the literature that is related to the maximum entropy and NER for the Hindi language. Section 3 describes a BL-MENE for an NER in Hindi, which includes a baseline MENE model, its significance, and its related features. Section 4 details a CP-MENE system that is comprised of the context pattern-based MENE model, its significance, and its exten- sive features. Section 5 illustrates the Hindi NER s experimental results as compared to CP-MENE and other NER approaches. Section 6 concludes the paper. 2. Related literature This section briefly discusses the literature that is related to the maximum entropy (ME) model and named-entity recognition in the Hindi language. In order to under- stand the jargon that is used here, researchers are directed to go through Appendix B. 2.1. Maximum entropy The maximum entropy framework supports widespread applications with a wider timeline (1998 present day), as is detailed in the literature below. Borthwick et al. [11] applied ME for the NER task at the MUC-7 conference; it was there where the term MENE was coined. They discussed the fact that MENEs 84 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K. Tayal can work better when combined with rule-based approaches. Osborne [96] stated that ME exploited categorical features to a greater extent as compared to na ve Bayes and showed the better performance of sentence extraction for document summariza- tion and for question-answering systems. Bender et al. [8] detailed MENEs by using a Gaussian prior for effective smoothing over a larger feature set. Han et al. [52] de- scribed ME performance for estimating the probability of English articles (a/an, the, or zero article) for noun phrases that use local-context features; these have proven to be beneficial for speakers of Chinese, Russian, Korean, Japanese, and other languages that do not contain articles. Benajiba et al. [7] built an NER system for the Arabic language (named ANERsys) while using the ME model. Ekbal et al. [32] proposed an ME-based part-of-speech (POS) tagger that outperforms HMM-based taggers for the Bengali language. Saha et al. [111] provided a study on word clustering- and word selection-based feature reduction for NER using the ME classifier. Ekbal et al. [33] proposed an ME-based NER under a multi-objective optimization framework for the resource-constrained Bengali language and achieved an F measure of 77.11%. In addition, there are several other NLP applications that use the ME model, such as prepositional phrase attachment [105], parsing [14], word morphology [134], relational extraction [69], phrase reordering [137], word-sense disambiguation [12], phonotactic learning [56], text classification [37], and many more. ME is characterized by the fact that it maintains a reasonable performance even when there is little available data for the training purpose. Also, ME is highly portable for other languages and domains for su icient and appropriate training corpora; e.g., ME has achieved good results with the Hindi, Gujarati, and Bangla languages for the FIRE-2013 shared task [43]. In the biomedical domain, Raychaudhuri et al. [106] applied ME to gene ontology tags, where it routinely outperforms the na ve Bayes and k-nearest neighbor methods. Pakhomov [97] discussed ME usage for acronym and ab- breviation normalization within medical texts. Mora et al. [87] showed that the ME model is useful for antibody diversity. Asti et al. [4] mentioned that the ME model is beneficial for predicting antigen-antibody a inity. 2.2. NER in Hindi NERs in the Hindi language represent works that are primarily in the news, health, and web-source domains that are discussed here. Table 1 summarizes the Hindi NER literature according to a chronological order of the years of publication, benchmark datasets, Hindi NER methodologies, NEs, and F-measure values. Along with the com- monly stated literature, there are some more related studies such as Saha et al. [114], who have worked on the sports corpus, and Patel et al. [98], who have observed inductive logic programming (ILP) through the WARMR and TILDE-C4.5 method- ologies. Several researchers have performed detailed surveys on Hindi NERs; e.g., [65,70,99,101,119], and [121].

RC3: propose novel CP-MEME method for dealing with boundary detection, mis- classification errors, and partial recognition of NEs. RC4: compare CP-MENE with respect to other existing Hindi NER approaches. 3. Baseline MENE To perform the NER task, the baseline maximum entropy-based named-entity method [11] is applied. BL-MENE serves as a statistical framework that is flex- ible enough for incorporating diversified knowledge resources without looking into hand-coded patterns at all. BL-MENE includes lexical features that are binary- valued (either 0 or 1) in nature; it neither acquires human intrusion nor references to external knowledge sources and serves as an important contributor to the bulk of MENE s power. Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 89 3.1. BL-MENE model The BL-MENE model undergoes a training phase where an HHD training data set is tokenized and each token is labeled with an NE outcome that is based on the following criteria. The set of N(= 4) tags are based on the four considered NE categories (Person, Disease, Consumable, and Symptom), and a particular tag (XXX) from the N tags is in one of four states (Begin [B-XXX], Continue [I-XXX], End [E-XXX], and Unique [U-XXX]) with an additional tag (Other [O]) to indicate an unnamed entity. In other words, an NER problem can be reduced to a problem of assigning one of the possible tags in an overall outcome space (F) that is comprised of a tag-set that has a maximum limit of 4N + 1(= 17) tags. Given input sentence (Sin) from the HHD corpus, for example, its NE outcome (Sne) is stated as below: Input (Sin): (mix apple cider vinegar into one cup water) Output (Sne): B-CNS I-CNS E-CNS O O O U-CNS O O In other words, NE annotation on Sin is represented as /B-CNS /I-CNS /E-CNS /O /O / /U-CNS /O /O Here, Fs = Sne = B-CNS, I-CNS, E-CNS, O, O, O, U-CNS, O, O, and Fs F F= {B-PER, I-PER, E-PER, B-DIS, I-DIS, E-DIS, B-CNS, I-CNS, E-CNS, B-SMP, I-SMP, E-SMP, U-PER, U-DIS, U-CNS, U-SMP, O} To generate an outcome space Fs for the test phase, BL-MENE is linked with the feature set (Section 3.3 BL-MENE Features) and labeled as a training corpus. BL-MENE computes the conditional probability as can be seen in Equation (1). P(t|h) = i fi(h,t) i z (h) = i fi(h,t) i t i fi(h,t) i (1) where: t NE tag (t F), F overall outcome space, h history (condition data to make decision among F from H, H space of possible histories, P(t/h) probability for any tag t, for every history h, fi ith feature, i real-valued weight parameter of fi, Z (h) normalization factor, i fi(h,t) i product of weightings for all features active on history for tag t. 90 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K. Tayal Here, the weight parameter ( i) is optimized by using the conjugate gradient descent (CGD)-based optimization technique [84]. CGD converges faster and is nu- merically more stable than other optimization techniques such as generalized iterative scaling (GIS) and improved iterative scaling (ITS) [44,96]. 3.2. BL-MENE significance BL-MENE concentrates on finding the features that characterizes an NER problem and leaves an assignment of the feature weights behind for an estimation routine. It is observed that the BL-MENE estimation routine guarantees that, for each feature, the expected value of fi (Equation (2)) must equal an empirical expectation of fi (Equation (3)). f expected i = (h,t) (H,F ) P(h, t).fi(h, t) (2) f empiricalexpected i = (h,t) observed(H,F ) fi(h, t) (3) Baseline MENE assigns a new piece of text with the appropriate NE tags after training with the proper weight assignment for each feature. BL-MENE aims to mark correct tags for NEs and does not allow any invalid tag sequences to occur. For instance, tag sequence [B-PER, I-DIS] is invalid since it does not contain an ending token; moreover, these two tokens are not of the same NE-tag category. 3.3. BL-MENE features For the success of any machine-learning approach, an appropriate feature selection is quite critical. In this research, a BL-MENE-based classifier is considered, as it is capable enough to utilize various features while computing conditional probabilities for NE types. This section details the baseline MENE features for the Hindi NER as follows: Head Noun: A head noun is usually defined as a major noun or noun phrase of an NE that describes its function or property. Word Window: A word window feature represents the previous words and the next words of a current HHD corpus word as a feature. A word window with a size of five is considered; i.e., wi+2 i 2=wi 2, wi 1, w0, wi+1, wi+2. Here, w0 is the current word, wi 2, wi 1 are the two previous words, and wi+1, wi+2 are the two following words. Root Word: A root word feature represents the root forms of HHD corpus words by using a Hindi morphological analyzer (http://sampark.iiit.ac.in/hindimorph/ web/restapi.php/indic/morphclient). This checks the root words, as Hindi is morphologically rich and its corpus words are highly inflected in different forms based on number, case, tense, and gender. Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 91 Word Su ix: A word su ix feature represents the su ix of current words and those that surround the HHD corpus that is considered as a feature. Two- to four-character su ixes are used. Table 2 represents sample su ixes and their corresponding examples from the HHD corpus. Table 2 Word su ixes Su ix Examples - , , , - , , , , , - , , , , - , , , - , , - , Word Length: This represents the word length of HHD corpus words as a fea- ture. The length of HHD corpus words occurs within a range of 3 25 letters that belong to a certain NE class. Table 3 represents the HHD corpus word, word length, and corresponding NE type. Table 3 Word-length feature HHD Word Word Length NE Type (Mother) 3 PER _ (Gastrointestinal Cancer) 25 DIS NE Information: The NE information feature represents the NE tags of the previous words as a dynamic feature. Frequent Words: A list of the most frequently occurring words in the HHD corpus is prepared, and those words that occur more than 15 times are considered to be frequent words. Shallow Parsing: The shallow parsing feature represents chunk information (https://www.nlpworld.co.uk/nlp-glossary/c/chunking/) that is useful for know- ing constituents such as the noun group, verb, verb group, etc. of the HHD corpus by using a Hindi shallow parser (http://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/analyzer/hindi/). N-Gram: The n-gram feature currently extracts uni-grams, bi-grams, and tri- grams from the HHD corpus due to limitations in the corpus size. Stop Words: The reemoval of stop words from the HHD corpus and the gener- ation of word pairs from the rest of the HHD corpus formulates these word pairs as an extremely crude syntax approximation. This may be useful for removing those word pairs that consist solely of stop words. However, incorporating the stop words within the word pairs of the HHD corpus improves the BL-MENE system (which results in better NER performance). 92 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K. Tayal 4. Context pattern-based MENE Baseline MENE can find NEs, but some are partially recognized NEs and are mis- takenly classified as NEs. To resolve such a crucial issue, a context pattern-based MENE is needed for NER. The CP-MENE methodology is garnered with an effort to boost the baseline MENE performance while additionally incorporating a pattern set and an extensive feature set. These features include right-boundary, left-boundary, part-of-speech, synonym, gazetteer (single- or multi-word-entity dictionaries), and relative pronoun features. CP-MENE is well-suited for NE tagging decisions, as it significantly improves NER s performance over BL-MENE. 4.1. CP-MENE model The context pattern-based MENE model has a sequence of token representations that possess a strong meaning as a unit and are independent of the individual words that are treated separately. CP-MENE characterizes the indices of patterns in which the words are included; otherwise, it treats them as zero whenever no pattern match is found. CP-MENE formulates a kind of recursive relationship to extract highly ranked NE patterns that are generated based on the regular expressions via Python@ code; these are exemplified in Equations (4) through (10). < pattern_list >:=< pattern > [ | < pattern_list >] (4) < pattern >:=< token_list > [ , < pattern >]| ( < token_list > ) [ , < pattern >] (5) < token_list >:=< token_expression > [ | < token_list >] | ( < token_expression > ) [ | < token_list >] (6) < token_expression >:=< token_name > [< postposition_marker >] [< name_constraint >] (7) < token_name >:=< gaz_list > [ name( < gaz_list > ) ] | name( < gaz_list > ) [< token_name >] (8) < gaz_list >:=< element_name > [ , < gaz_list >] | ( < element_name > ) [ , < gaz_list >] (9) < name_constraint >:=< Bv_sG > [ , < name_constraint >] | ( < Bv_sG > ) [ , < name_constraint >] (10) The CP-MENE model observes that <pattern_list> represents a list of patterns that are generated from the HHD corpus using <pattern>; <pattern> represents a list Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 93 of tokens that are built up using <token_list>; <token_list> represents a series of to- ken expressions that are constructed using <token_expression>; <token_expression> represents the token name(s) from the HHD corpus using <token_name>, the op- tional <postposition_marker>, and <name_constraint>; <token_name> represents tokens from gazetteers that are incorporated from gazetteer lists; <gaz_list> repre- sents a gazetteer list for names using <element_name>; <element_name> represents single or multiple words within the gazetteers NEs dictionaries that are extended by using the Hindi WordNet synset <HWN_synset>; and Hindi WordNet (HWN) is a lexical database for the Hindi language that was developed at IIIT Hyderabad, In- dia. HWN is useful for grouping various Hindi words into sets of synonyms; this is also known as a synset (http://www.cfilt.iitb.ac.in/wordnet/webhwn/). In addition, Hindi grammar contains a postposition tag that represents short words that are placed after nouns and are very similar to prepositions in English. This tag is known as (postposition) in Hindi, which is transliterated as <saM- baMXa_boXaka> and acronym as <sM_bX> [47]; within the CP-MENE model, this is represented as <postposition_marker>. On the same lines, the Abstract Noun tag is a noun type that is defined in terms of aspect, concept, experience, feeling, idea, state of being, trait, quality, or another entity that is not experienced with the five human senses (sight, touch, hearing, taste, and smell). This tag is known as - (abstract noun) in Hindi, which is transliterated as <BAv_vAcaka_saMGYA> and acronymized as <Bv_sG> [47]; within the CP-MENE model, this is represented as <name_constraint>. Consider example <pattern_list> (the advice of a doctor) as input into the CP-MENE model (as can be seen in Figure 1). Figure 1. CP-MENE Model 94 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K. Tayal <pattern_list> undergoes recursive <pattern>, <token_list>, and <token_ex- pression> phases; <token_expression> is broken down into <token_name>, <post- position_marker>, and <name_constraint>; and <token_name> provides <gaz_- list> (such as a PER gazetteer) that carries a recursive <element_name>. The PER s <element_name> generates words such as (doctor), (specialist), and (doctor) using the Hindi WordNet synset <HWN_synset>; <postposi- tion_marker> extracts <sM_bX> such as (of), (to), and (from); <name_constraint> extracts textit<Bv_sG> such as (advice), (opinion), and (suggestion), which are extended using <HWN_sysnset>. Thus, context patterns are generated in a recursive manner from the HHD corpus using the CP-MENE model. 4.2. CP-MENE significance CP-MENE is capable of resolving the boundary-detection problem by extending the boundary of the partially recognized NEs and considering the maximal NE classifica- tion. Once the boundary error correction is performed, the NER results of BL-MENE are reclassified. CP-MENE allows for flexible feature selection; i.e., new features are added to MENE so that there is no need to reformulate the model, and its estima- tion routine automatically calculates new weight assignments. CP-MENE considers features in a categorical manner; it yields significant results when accompanied with extremely informative features but does not make unnecessary feature independence assumptions. CP-MENE exploits beneficial features, ignores irrelevant features, inte- grates knowledge sources (such as Hindi WordNet), and is supported with optimized priors that are potentially useful for the NER task. 4.3. CP-MENE features The CP-MENE features for the NER in Hindi includes right-boundary, left-boundary, synonym, part-of-speech, gazetteer list, and relative pronoun features; each of these is detailed as follows: Right-Boundary (FRH): the right-boundary feature is computed when an NE is followed by another NE or a head noun of the same type. Table 4 depicts the right-boundary feature in detail. Left-Boundary (FLB): The left-boundary feature is computed when a Not- Named Entity (NNE) is followed by head noun based Named Entity (NE)-type then it results in the formulation of an extended Named Entity. Table 5 depicts the left-boundary feature in detail. Gazetteer Lists (FGL): Gazetteers lists (or simply gazetteers GAZ) are entity dictionaries that are important for effectively performing NER [118]. These are dependent on neither previously discovered tokens nor on annotations; they only expect raw text as input and then find matches in the HHD corpus based on its contents. The dictionary feature contains single- or multi-word dictionaries and are an important component of the CP-MENE system. Table 6 describes the Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 95 gazetteers for each NE type and the total count of NEs in each gazetteer, and it provides illustrative examples. For example, the gazetteer list for a person NE contains 3726 named entities and other details. Synonym (FSS): The synonym feature extends synonyms of the HHD corpus words using the Hindi WordNet synset (as can be seen in Table 7). Relative Pronoun (FRP ): The relative pronoun (pronoun type) feature is used to introduce a relative or dependent clause in a sentence or as a stan- dalone subject or object of the sentence. This is represented in Hindi grammar as - , which is transliterated as <saMbaMXa_boXaka_srvnAma> and acronymized as <sM_sr> [47]. The relative pronoun feature in Hindi represents special words such as (who), (whom), (which), (whom), (whose), (whose), and (whomever). In addition, their answers are those previously seen nouns in the HHD corpus that belong to the NE types. Part-of-Speech (FP S): The part-of-speech feature represents the part-of- speech markers or linguistic category of the HHD corpus words (which are also known as the lexical or grammatical categories) while using two taggers. These two taggers are the POS tagger from IIIT Hyderabad and the TENGRAM method (both are detailed here). Table 8 shows an example of an HHD cor- pus sentence that is tagged using the two taggers. POS TAGGER (IIIT HYDERABAD): The POS tagger for Hindi, which was developed at IIIT Hyderabad (https://bitbucket.org/sivareddyg/ hindi-part-of-speech-tagger/), India, is comprised of a variety of POS tags that are based on English grammar. Such tags include noun tags (NN sin- gular nouns; NNS plural nouns; NST nouns based on time and space; NNP proper nouns), verb tags (VM main verbs; VAUX auxiliary verbs), adjective tags (JJ), adverb tags (RB), postposition tags (PSP), con- junction tags (CC), and punctuation tags (PUNC). POS TAGGER (TENGRAM): The POS tagger using the TENGRAM [47] method is comprised of a variety of POS tags that are based on Hindi grammar. Such tags (Appendix A) include sG: (noun), vN: (adjective), ky: (verb) (mu_ky: (main verb) and amu_ky: (auxiliary verb)), sM_bX: (postposition), and vr_cn: (punctuation). The (noun) tag is further classified as vv_sG: (proper noun), jv_sG: (common noun), sv_- sG: (collective noun), xv_sG: (material noun), and Bv_sG: (abstract noun). Among these diverse (noun) tags are (proper noun), (common noun), and (collective noun); these are beneficial for PER s NE recogni- tion. (material noun) is advantageous for CNS NE recognition, and (abstract noun) is helpful in CP-MENE-based NE pattern recognition. 96 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K.

Evaluation setup and results Section 5.1 discusses HHD dataset statistics. Section 5.2 determines CP-MENE- based context patterns for Hindi NER. Section 5.3 evaluates performance-evaluation measures (precision, recall, and F-measure) for BL-MENE and CP-MENE. Section 5.4 compares CP-MENE with respect to BL-MENE and other NER approaches [64]. 5.1. Dataset statistics For experimental purposes, the HHD corpus is crawled from four well-known Hindi health domain-based Indian websites: The Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (http://www.tkdl.res.in/), the Ministry of Ayush (http://ayush.gov.in/), the Univer- sity of Patanjali (https://www.patanjaliayurved.net/), and the Linguistic Data Con- sortium for Indian Languages (http://www.ldcil.org/). The HHD corpus is uploaded from the Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/aijain/hindi-health-dataset/) and is comprised of the following dataset statistics: the corpus contains a total num- ber of 193 MS Word pages that contain 5236 paragraphs, 9483 lines, 105,058 words, 98 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K. Tayal 411,462 characters (with no spaces), and 517,847 characters (with spaces). The cor- pus provides in-depth information of more than 100 diseases and their descriptions along with detailed symptoms, causes, treatments, and home remedies. The corpus is formed from unstructured data, from which four named-entity types are identified and classified: Person, Disease, Consumable, and Symptom. For training purposes, 80% of the corpus was considered; the unseen remaining 20% of the corpus was chosen as the test corpus. 5.2. CP-MENE patterns for Hindi NER CP-MENE promises the longest NE annotation over BL-MENE-based individual word NE annotations. The longest NE annotations are formulated through context patterns that are beneficial for recognizing the specified NE types. Table 9 identifies the CP- -MENE-based context patterns for each NE type (including the pattern count and exemplified patterns). Table 9 CP-MENE identified context patterns NE Type Count of Context Patterns Example Context Patterns Elaborative Examples PER 125 <PER > (Advice from <PER>) DIS 101 <DIS > (Diagnosis of <DIS>) CNS 375 <CNS > (Intake of <CNS>) SMP 242 <SMP > (Feeling of <SMP>) 5.3. Evaluation measures for CP-MENE In order to evaluate the NER models, precision, recall, and F-measure are considered. Table 10 determines the results that were obtained by the two classifiers (BL-MENE and CP-MENE), both of which being further broken down by the respective en- tity types. Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 99 Table 10 Comparison of BL-MENE- and CP-MENE-based NER NE TYPE BL-MENE CP-MENE Precision [%] Recall [%] F-Measure [%] Precision [%] Recall [%] F-Measure [%] PER 78.34 75.49 76.89 79.89 79.47 79.68 DIS 66.32 64.39 65.34 72.25 72.75 72.50 CNS 55.35 56.64 55.99 70.25 67.37 68.78 SMP 52.88 53.65 53.26 70.29 64.43 67.23 Among all four NE types, PER and NE were the best performers, followed by DIS NE, CNS NE, and SMP NE. CP-MENE performed quite significantly as compared to BL-MENE. There was a slight increase in the F-measure result for the PER NE type (2.79% from BL-MENE to CP-MENE), while the greatest increase in the F-measure result for SMP NE was 53.26% (for BL-MENE) to 67.23% (for CP-MENE). For DIS NE, however, there was an increase of 7.16% in the F-measure result from BL-MENE to CP-MENE. And for CNS NE, the F-measure result was 55.99% for BL-MENE and 68.78% for CP-MENE. These results indicate an overall increase in F-measure results for the NE types in CP-MENE due to better context patterns, gazetteers, and extensive features as compared to BL-MENE. 5.4. Comparison of CP-MENE with other Hindi NER approaches CP-MENE is compared to other Hindi NER approaches with respect to the F-measure evaluation metric (as is detailed below). Figure 2 compares the CP-MENE approach with respect to BL-MENE and an ontology-based Hindi NER approach [64]. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of CP-MENE over the other NER approaches. It can be observed that, for all of the four chosen NE types (PER, DIS, CNS, and SMP), CP-MENE s performance was slightly better when compared to OntoHindi NER and much better when compared to BL-MENE. The OntoHindi NER [64] methodology maps ontology for health data in order to recognize NEs while maintaining the hierarchical information of ontological cat- egories using Hindi WordNet (HWN). This methodology is comprised of five stages when building gazetteer lists: data pre-processing, feature engineering, string match- ing, concept hierarchy-based mapping (CHM), and concept selection and aggregation (COSA). For building gazetteer lists, initial seed lists are chosen that are further extended by using HWN. For data pre-processing, tokenization, phonetic transforma- tion, and stop-word removal are considered. For feature engineering, frequency and part-of-speech tag filters are applied. For string matching, the Levenshtein distance and the linguistic-based improved Lin s matcher are applied. CHM extracts the onto- logical concepts of the corpus words and provides hierarchical and ontological chain structures for dendogram generation with respect to each NE category. Furthermore, 100 Arti Jain, Divakar Yadav, Anuja Arora, Devendra K. Tayal COSA helps improve the CHM-generated clustering results by allowing optimized selection and k-means aggregation, which results in fine-grained NE clusters. Figure 2. HHD-based comparison of different Hindi NER approaches OntoHindi NER achieved the following F-measure results: PER (78.77%), DIS (71.57%), CNS (64.59%), and SMP (62.37%); however, CP-MENE-based NER achieved the following F-measure results: PER (79.68%), DIS (72.50%), CNS (68.78%), and SMP (67.23%). This shows that CP-MENE outperformed OntoHindi NER because of the fact that OntoHindi NER works with a single-word ontology while CP-MEME considers the longest NE annotations. 6. Conclusion Named entities (NEs) make up one of the most important indexing elements in a given text for information extraction and other mining tasks. The construction of a named- -entity-recognition system (NER) becomes quite challenging if proper resources for a language (such as Hindi) are not available. To solve this issue, the Hindi health domain (HHD) corpus was chosen from the Kaggle dataset, and four NE categories (Person [PER], Disease [DIS], Consumable [CNS], and Symptom [SMP] NEs) were considered. In order to perform NER on the HHD corpus, two methodologies were ap- plied: baseline maximum entropy-based named-entity (BL-MENE), and context pat- tern-based MENE (CP-MENE) for NER. BL-MENE is an existing method that serves Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 101 as a flexible statistical framework and uses diversified features without looking into hand-coded patterns. The proposed CP-MENE method incorporates baseline MENE, pattern set, and extensive features. For each NE type, CP-MENE identifies var- ied context patterns and incorporates distinguished features. These features include right-boundary, left-boundary, part-of-speech, synonym, gazetteer list, and relative pronoun features. The part-of-speech feature is applied by using two taggers: the IIIT Hyderabad tagger (which uses English grammar), and the TENGRAM method (which uses Hindi grammar). POS tags that use Hindi grammar give more-detailed NE types as compared to English grammar. Even though BL-MENE performs the NER task, some NEs that are partially recognized or mistakenly classified by the base- line MENE are still left out in the HHD corpus. CP-MENE handles these boundary- detection and NE misclassification errors while exploiting beneficial features, ignoring irrelevant features, and integrating knowledge sources such as Hindi WordNet. In ad- dition, CP-MENE is supported with an optimized prior that is potentially useful for the NER task. Thus, CP-MENE is observed to be more significant as compared to other Hindi NER approaches (OntoHindi NER [64], and BL-MENE). The findings of this research may serve as a beneficial tool especially for those health care profes- sionals who work in the northern rural areas of India (where the patients and their relatives do not understand English but are familiar with the Hindi language). These professionals investigate patient reports, diagnose diseases and their symptoms, coun- sel the eating habits of their patients, and comfort their patient s friends and family all while needing to be understandable in Hindi. These professionals can also facili- tate people through text summarizations and question-answering systems (i.e., giving verbal summaries of investigated reports, answering questions that are related to diseases, etc.) while applying the proposed Hindi NER system. Limitations: The proposed NER system does not involve a deep-learning task. The NER system is applied only for the Hindi language and was tested over four NE categories. In the future, a CP-MENE-based NER system can be mapped with a deep- learning strategy to further upgrade the results. Also, the proposed NER system can be applied to other Indian languages. In addition, some other NE types (such as treat- ment, quantity, and food) can be considered with more training corpora and enhanced sophisticated features that can further improve the NER system s performance.

Appendix A It is important to note the following information regarding the applied POS tags in Hindi grammar [47]. Noun Tag: N A noun tag is a part of speech that defines the name of a person, place, thing, idea, quality, etc. In Hindi grammar, a noun is considered to be , which is transliterated as <saMGYA> and acronymized as <sG>. Proper Noun: A proper noun is defined as a unique entity that refers to the name of a specific person, place, or object and is represented in Hindi grammar as , which is transliterated as <v\yak\wi_vAcaka_- saMGYA> and acronymized as <vv_sG>. Common Noun: A common noun is defined as the class of an entity that refers to the name of any individual person, place, or object and is represented in Hindi grammar as , which is transliterated as <jAwi_vAcaka_saMGYA> and acronymized as as <jv_sG>. Named-entity recognition for Hindi language 113 Collective Noun: A collective noun is defined as a group or collec- tion of people or things and is represented in Hindi grammar as - , which is transliterated as <samuxAya_vAcaka_saMGYA> and acronymized as <sv_sG>. Material Noun: A material noun is defined as the name of a substance that something is made of and is represented in Hindi grammar as , which is transliterated as <xrav\ya_vAcaka_saMGYA> and acronymized as <xv_sG>. Adjective Tag: An adjective tag is a part of speech that describes, identifies, or quantifies a noun or pronoun. In Hindi grammar, an adjective tag is considered to be , which is transliterated as <visheSNa> and acronymized as <vN>. Verb Tag: A verb tag is a part of speech that describes an action, state, or occurrence and forms the main part of the predicate of a sentence. In Hindi grammar, a verb tag is considered to be , which is transliterated as <kriyA> and acronymized as <ky>. Punctuation Tag: A punctuation tag is a part of speech that describes marks such as periods (full stops), commas, and brackets (which are used to sepa- rate sentences and their elements and to clarify meanings). In Hindi grammar, a punctuation tag is considered to be , which is transliterated as <vi- rAma_cinha> and acronymized as <vr_cn>.
