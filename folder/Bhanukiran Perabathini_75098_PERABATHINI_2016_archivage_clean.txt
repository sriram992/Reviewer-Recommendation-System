Sans sur- prise, le probl`eme de la r eduction de la con- sommation d energie doit etre abord e `a diverses couches de l architecture de r eseau et de di- verses directions. Cette th`ese traite de cer- tains aspects cruciaux de la couche physique de l architecture de r eseau sans l a n de trouver des solutions e caces d energie. Dans la premi`ere partie de cette th`ese, nous explorons l id ee de l e cacit e energ etique `a un niveau fondamental. `A commencer par r epon- dre aux questions telles que: - Qu est-ce que la forme physique d information ?, nous con- struisons un dispositif de communication simple a n d isoler certaines etapes cl es dans le proces- sus physique de la communication et nous dire comment elles a ectent l e cacit e energ etique d une communication syst`eme. Dans la deuxi`eme partie, nous utilisons des outils de la g eom etrie stochastique pour mod- eliser th eoriquement r eseaux cellulaires a n d analyser l e cacit e energ etique du syst`eme. L exploitation de la tra cabilit e d une telle mod- elisation math ematique, nous explorons les conditions dans lesquelles la consommation d energie peut etre r eduite. En outre, dans cette partie, nous introduisons le concept de la mise en cache des donn ees des utilisateurs `a la p eriph erie du r eseau (`a savoir le nal ac BS qui est en contact avec l utilisateur) et de montrer quantitativement comment la mise en cache peut aider `a am eliorer l e cacit e energ e- tique d un cellulaire r eseau. Nous tenons egalement `a ce traitement `a un ac Hetnet sc enario (`a savoir quand il ya plus d un type de glspl d eploy e BS) et etudions divers in- dicateurs de performance cl es. Nous explorons egalement les conditions o`u l e cacit e energ e- tique d un tel syst`eme peut etre am elior e. Les r esultats de th`ese fournissent quelques id ees cl es pour am eliorer l e cacit e energ etique dans un r eseau cellulaire sans l contribuant ainsi `a l avancement vers la prochaine g en eration (5 G) les r eseaux cellulaires. i Title: Fundamental limits of Energy E ciency in Wireless Networks Keywords: energy e ciency, communication systems, thermodynamics, stochastic geometry, cellular networks, 5G Abstract: The task of meeting an ever grow- ing demand for better quality of user experi- ence in wireless communications is challenged by the amount of energy consumed by the tech- nologies involved and the methods employed. Not surprisingly, the problem of reducing en- ergy consumption needs to be addressed at var- ious layers of the network architecture as well as from various perspectives. This thesis ad- dresses some important energy saving possibil- ities at the physical layer of wireless network architecture in order to nd energy e cient so- lutions. In the rst part of this thesis, we explore the idea of energy e ciency at a fundamental level. Starting with answering questions such as What is the physical form of information? , we build a simple communication device in or- der to isolate the key steps in the physical pro- cess of communication and we study how each of these steps nally in uences the energy e - ciency of the communication system. In the sec- ond part, we use tools from stochastic geometry to theoretically model a cellular network so as to analyze its energy consumption. Exploiting the tractability of such a mathematical model- ing, we explore the conditions under which the energy consumption can be either reduced or utilized more e ciently or both. Further, we introduce the concept of caching users data at the edge of the network (namely the nal Base Station (BS) that is in contact with the end user) and show quantitatively how incorporating caching in the network can help improve the energy e ciency. We also ex- tend this treatment to a Heterogeneous Net- work (HetNet) scenario (namely when there are more than one type of BSs deployed) and study various key performance metrics. We also ex- plore the conditions where energy e ciency of such a system can be improved. The results in thesis provide some key ideas re- garding improving energy e ciency in a wire- less cellular network thereby contributing to the advancement towards the next generation (5G) cellular networks. ii .. to all those curious minds who de antly refused to be humbled by the sheer magnitude of the unknown. iii Acknowledgments My sincere thanks to my PhD advisors Prof M erouane Debbah and Prof Marios Kountouris for their guidance throughout the period of my PhD.

Le moteur peut etre fabriqu e soit de telle sorte qu elle se d eplace sur une longue distance, mais `a une vitesse de compromis ou de telle sorte qu elle passe `a une vitesse impressionnante tandis que la distance qu il peut parcourir est plus courte. De toute evidence, il existe un compromis entre les deux cas et, au lieu d etre simple, d e nissant EE d epend de l utilit e sp eci que, nous cherchons d un syst`eme. Dans le contexte des t el ecommunications sans l, EE est souvent d e nie dans la litt erature comme etant le rapport entre le d ebit total et la puissance totale consomm ee dans l emetteur. Maximiser la EE ne garantit que l energie est utilement d epens e, mais il est toujours important de garder `a l esprit que la r ealisation de ce maximum ne doit pas d epasser nos limites budg etaires. Il y a eu des etudes portant sur ce sujet `a partir de directions di erentes. Dans [3], optimisation de EE d un Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) pointer-`a-point est etudi e dans les cas o`u imparfaite Channel State Information (CSI) est disponible uniquement `a l emetteur et est disponible uniquement `a la n r ecepteur. Dans [4], EE est optimis e par rapport au nombre d antennes syst`eme MIMO, o`u un mod`ele de consommation d energie r ealiste `a chaque BS a et e pris en compte. Dans [5], la densit e de points d acc`es (AP), le nombre d antennes et d utilisateurs par AP, et la puissance de transmission ont et e optimis es pour maximal EE. Travaux de Li Chang et al, (voir [6], par exemple) etude EE aspects de petits r eseaux cellulaires en termes de BS densit es et des co uts d energie au BSs. Le consortium GreenTouch r ecemment 1 a publi e un livre blanc [7] sur l etude vert recherche compteur qui pr etend qu il est possible gr ace `a une combinaison de changements dans les technologies, les architectures, des composants, des algorithmes et des protocoles `a r eduire la consommation d energie nette dans les r eseaux 118 Juin, 2015 1 1.2. Les aspects physiques de la transmission sans l des informations de bout en bout des communications jusqu `a 98 % en 2020 par rapport au sc enario de r ef erence 2010 d e ni par GreenTouch. Selon cette augmentation de 10.000 fois de l e cacit e energ etique dans les r eseaux d acc`es mobiles est possible en int egrant l evolution des technologies, des architectures, des composants, des algorithmes et des protocoles existants. En ce qui concerne les r eseaux d acc`es mobiles, parmi la liste propos ee des id ees sont: Au-del`a de Cellular Generation Green (BCG2): les donn ees de fractionnement et de signalisation entre deux couches superpos ees et incorporant a et e montr e `a la demande de connectivit e pour etre une solution e cace de l energie. Grande echelle Syst`emes d antennes (LSAS): Au lieu de servir des terminaux mobiles au moyen d antennes encombrants qui rayonnent de puissance dans les secteurs, cette technique essaie de diriger le pouvoir `a l utilisateur o`u il est n ecessaire. Ceci est r ealis e en utilisant un grand nombre de personnes physiquement petit, de faible puissance, des antennes `a commande individuelle pour cr eer une pluralit e de faisceaux s electifs par l utilisateur de donn ees. La puissance porteur de donn ees est donc dirig ee uniquement o`u elle est n ecessaire et evite les interf erences inutiles. Bien que ces r esultats semblent prometteurs, une analyse plus approfondie doit encore etre fait pour elargir le nombre de possibilit es d atteindre les technologies de r eseau sans l de la prochaine g en eration e cace de l energie. Comme il ne peut etre un rem`ede universellement valable et viable `a intensi er vers les technologies vertes, cette recherche est cruciale. La pr esente th`ese vient dans le cadre de l exploration diverses possibilit es d accro tre l e cacit e energ etique dans les r eseaux sans l. 1.2 Les aspects physiques de la transmission sans l des informations D un point de vue fondamental, il est connu depuis longtemps que le processus de communication a toujours un co ut en termes d energie [8 10]. En 1948, Shannon a publi e son r evolutionnaire papier [11] dans lequel les conditions dans lesquelles l information peut etre communiqu ee de mani`ere able sont math ematiquement quanti es. Il est d un grand int er et pour aborder ce point pr ecis `a nouveau, mais du point de vue de la d epense energ etique prenant cr eation et le traitement des informations en compte. Dans son sens courant, l information est un concept abstrait et est souvent consid er ee comme sub- jective. Cependant, dans ses informations de sens objectif signi e pr ecis ement un ensemble de r eseau convenable de syst`emes physiques pr epar es dans les etats souhait es. La nature physique de l information est trait ee dans [12]. Pour donner quelques exemples: Un message de texte ecrit sur un morceau de papier avec un crayon, mais est une parmi plusieurs agencements possibles d un ensemble de mol ecules de carbone dans le plan bidimensionnel d un document. Un chier audio inscrit sur un disque compact est essentiellement une collection de fosses et des bosses grav ees sur elle dans un ordre unique. Braille trac ee sur un papier, des signaux tels que des ronds de fum ee, tambours, sir`enes, etc. sont toutes les entit es physiques quanti ables et elles impliquent toutes l utilisation de l energie lors de leur cr eation, la destruction propagation de amd. Si un syst`eme physique choisi a deux etats distincts de l information repr esent ee par un tel syst`eme est appel e un bit. Il a et e d emontr e qu une grande quantit e d information peut etre repr esent ee en termes de nombre su sant de ces bits de [11]. Pr eparation d un syst`eme physique dans un etat, ou changement de son etat de l un `a l autre n ecessite de l energie. Bien qu il puisse y avoir d innombrables possibilit es 2 1.3. Analyse architecturale la d epense energ etique pour les syst`emes physiques qui peuvent etre utilis es dans la pr eparation, la modi cation et le stockage de l information donn ee, le choix du syst`eme ne d ecide combien d energie est n ecessaire pour e ectuer ces op erations. Le premi`ere question que nous posons dans cette partie de la th`ese porte sur ce point. Dans une tentative d explorer la r eponse `a la question: Quelle est l energie choix e cace la plupart des syst`emes physiques pour repr esenter et traiter l information?, nous commen cons par un syst`eme thermodynamique simples (section 3.2.1) pour repr esenter un bit d information. Dans le domaine de la physique classique est vraiment le meilleur moyen de stocker des bits du point de vue energ etique. Dans le chapitre 3, nous discutons en d etail comment l energie est d epens ee dans la pr eparation et de traitement (op erations sur) ces bits. Le processus dans lequel les syst`emes physiques sont pr epar es dans les etats souhait es sont transport es de la transmission pointer vers le r eception point dans l espace et le temps `a travers un milieu est appel e transfert d informations. Ceci est un processus physique et donc n ecessite de l energie. La corr elation entre le r eseau d etats envoy e et le tableau des etats re cu est ce qui d etermine la qualit e du transfert de l information. Cette corr elation peut etre d eform ee `a cause d interf erences du monde physique (bruit), et une telle distorsion est quanti ee comme erreur. Il existe un compromis entre la quantit e d energie d epens ee au point de transmission et l information mutuelle (entre les etats re cus et les etats transmis) qui peuvent etre atteints. Une autre question que nous posons dans la premi`ere partie de cette th`ese porte sur ce point. Dans une tentative d explorer la r eponse `a la question: Quelle est la limite de l e cacit e d un syst`eme de communication prenant la cr eation de l information en compte ?, nous concevons un syst`eme pour convertir les informations repr esengt ees par la thermodynamique mentionn e ci-dessus . bits en ondes electromagn etiques pour atteindre la r eception, et d evaluer l e cacit e energ etique du syst`eme Nous sommes particuli`erement int eress es `a evaluer l e cacit e energ etique dans la communication un bit d information comme un cas limite (section 3.4.4). Contrairement `a la notion intuitive que l e cacit e peut etre arbitrairement augment ee en augmentant l investissement energ etique, nos r esultats montrent que les d epenses exc`es d energie ne doit pas n ecessairement etre une solution e cace en communication point-`a-point. Cette approche est importante non seulement pour le sans l les fournisseurs de services, mais aussi du point de vue des utilisateurs d appareils sans l qui sont souvent compromises par l ennui de charge fr equemment les batteries des appareils mobiles. En fait, cette partie du travail vient en lignes d explorer les aspects fondamentaux du calcul ainsi que la communication. 1.3 Analyse architecturale la d epense energ etique Stochastique mod elisation bas ee sur la g eom etrie La demande croissante de connectivit e, d ebit de donn ees, et la qualit e de service (QoS) ne peut pas etre satisfaite par la simple augmentation ind e niment la puissance d emission des stations de base BSs. Ceci est principalement d u au fait qu une augmentation de la puissance d emission, en plus d augmenter la puissance du signal de la station de base souhait e, augmente egalement les interf erences re cues par les stations de base de non-desserte. Cela peut e ectivement diminuer le rapport signal-sur-interf erence-plus- bruit (SINR) subie par le terminal utilisateur, ayant ainsi un impact n egatif sur la Quality-of-Service (QoS). En outre, il est egalement essentiel du point de vue de l e cacit e energ etique pour r esoudre le probl`eme de minimiser les d epenses d energie tout en conservant certaines contraintes telles que la couverture de la cible et le d ebit de donn ees minimum. Il existe di erentes approches pour r esoudre les probl`emes de r eduction de la consommation d energie th eoriquement. Par exemple, si un nombre ni de BSs sont d eploy ees dans un hexagone r egulier (ou grille) mode cellulaire comme dans la gure 4.2 [13], on pourrait chercher `a minimiser la puissance totale consom- m ee par l obtention des param`etres de fonctionnement optimaux, tels que la taille de cellule hexagonale et l amplitude de la puissance d emission au niveau de chaque BS, tout en garantissant une certaine QoS. N eanmoins, cette approche implique une analyse lourde que l evaluation de la r epartition spatiale de la SINR dans un mod`ele bas e sur une grille devient prohibitif complexe que la taille du syst`eme augmente 3 1.3. Analyse architecturale la d epense energ etique et on peut avoir recours `a des simulations. Une simpli cation commune dans la mod elisation de r eseaux cellulaires qui nous permet traitons le probl`eme analytiquement est de supposer que les emplacements des stations de base sont dispers es de fa con al eatoire sur une surface `a deux dimensions en plan selon un homog`ene PPP [14]. Plusieurs travaux ont etudi e la validit e de PPP mod elisation des stations de base (par rapport `a des mod`eles cellulaires r eguliers,) et il est souvent illustr ees a n de fournir des indications utiles sur le comportement statistique des indicateurs de performance cl es [15]. Certains chercheurs, en particulier ceux avec un arri`ere-plan de l industrie, expriment souvent le scepticisme sur l utilisation de la g eom etrie stochastique pour l analyse des performances des r eseaux cellulaires sans l. Leur accusation principale est que, dans un traitement `a base de la mod elisation g eom etrique stochastique n eglige le d e- ploiement r eel de BSs et se concentre plut ot sur la th eorie BS con gurations. Il faut souligner `a ce stade que le but de l utilisation de la g eom etrie stochastique est pas de r esoudre toute con guration r eelle de la vie r eelle d eploy ee d une collection de BSs, mais d acqu erir qualitative ainsi que des aper cus quantitatifs sur certains param`etres du syst`eme cruciales avec l aide du formalisme math ematique traitable plut ot que selon les simulations sp eci ques du syst`eme. Cela a et e assez soulign e dans les travaux de Andrews et al. Des r esultats plus r ecents sur l analyse stochastique des r eseaux cellulaires sans l peuvent etre trouv es dans [16 20] et r ef erences qui y sont. Est caching une solution e cace de l energie? Les deux universit es et l industrie sont maintenant dans une envie de faire evoluer les r eseaux cellulaires traditionnels vers la prochaine g en eration de r eseaux mobiles `a large bande, les r eseaux forg es 5G, visant `a satisfaire le tsunami de donn ees mobiles tout en minimisant les d epenses et la consommation d energie. Parmi ces e orts intensifs, le contenu des utilisateurs de mise en cache localement sur le bord du r eseau est consid er e comme l un des paradigmes les plus perturbateurs dans les r eseaux 5G [21]. Il est int eressant mais pas surprenant, des r esultats r ecents ont montr e que distribu e le cache de contenu peut d echarger consid erablement di erentes parties du r eseau, comme dans Radio Access Net- works (RANs) et Core Network (CN), par intelligemment pr echargement et le stockage de contenu plus proche des utilisateurs naux [22]. En e et, les r eseaux cellulaires traditionnels, qui ont et e con cus pour les appareils mobiles avec des capacit es de traitement et de stockage limit ees, ont commenc e `a int egrer les capacit es sensibles au contexte et proactives, aliment ees par les r ecents progr`es dans la puissance et de stockage de traitement. En cons equence, la mise en cache a r ecemment pris la litt erature 5G par la temp ete. Caching dans les r eseaux cellulaires de niveau unique Comme mentionn e pr ec edemment, les aspects de la consommation d energie des r eseaux cellulaires sont habituellement etudi ees en pla cant BSs sur une topologie hexagonale ou grille r eguli`ere et la conduite intensive des simulations de niveau syst`eme [23]. L`a, le but est de trouver les valeurs optimales des param`etres tels que la plage de cellules et BS transmettent la puissance, tout en minimisant la puis- sance totale consomm ee dans certaines QoS contraintes. En d epit de son attrait, il est assez lourde, voire impossible, d evaluer analytiquement les indicateurs de performance cl es dans les r eseaux `a grande echelle. Une simpli cation commune dans la mod elisation de r eseaux cellulaires est de placer le BSs sur un plan `a deux dimensions selon un espace homog`ene PPP, ce qui permet de traiter le probl`eme analytiquement [24]. Plusieurs travaux ont etudi e la validit e de PPP mod elisation de BSs par rapport `a des mod`eles cellulaires r eguliers (par exemple [25]) et des id ees suppl ementaires peuvent etre obtenus en caract erisant analytiquement les indicateurs de performance, tels que la distribution spatiale des Signal- To-Interference-Plus-Noise Ratio (SINR), la probabilit e de couverture, et le taux moyen [18, 19]. Plus r ecemment, l optimisation de la EE a et e abord ee assez bien dans les uvres d Emil et al, comme [26]. Dans cette th`ese, nous analysons (voir chapitre 5) aspects de la consommation d energie des d e- ploiements sans l r eseau `a palier unique cache activ e au moyen d un mod`ele spatial bas e sur la g eom etrie 4 1.4. Conclusions stochastique. Nous consid erons le probl`eme de l optimisation APC et EE de cache-enabled BSs dans un sc enario o`u BSs et les utilisateurs mobiles sont r epartis selon ind ependante homog`ene PPPs. Nous four- nissons des conditions dans lesquelles la consommation d energie de la zone est de r eduire au minimum l objet d une certaine qualit e de service (QoS) en termes de probabilit e de couverture. Par ailleurs, nous apportons la puissance d emission BS optimale qui maximise le rendement energ etique, d e ni comme le rapport de la surface au-dessus de l e cacit e spectrale de la puissance totale consomm ee. Le principal r esultat de cette analyse est que la mise en cache distribu ee de contenu dans les r eseaux cellulaires sans l se r ev`ele etre une solution e cace de l energie. Caching dans des r eseaux h et erog`enes R eseaux cellulaires sans l de l avenir sont susceptibles d etre h et erog`enes, `a savoir avoir un ou plusieurs niveaux de petites cellules superpos ees sur le niveau macrocellulaire. Des uvres telles que [27] etude EE dans un HetNet sc enario avec des strat egies de couchage incorpor es dans. Motiv e pour progresser dans cette ligne de recherche, nous etendons l id ee de la mise en cache du contenu des utilisateurs dans un (ou plusieurs) des niveaux dans un HetNet et d etudier comment cela in ue sur les aspects li es `a la consommation d energie du syst`eme sans l. Nous d e nissons et r esoudre des probl`emes d optimisation APC et EE par rapport `a la densit e de stations de base et de leurs puissances d emission. Dans le chapitre 6, nous analysons la consommation d energie aspects du r eseau sans l `a deux vitesses, o`u les petites cellules sont cache-enabled. 1.4 Conclusions Cette th`ese a pr esent e des solutions au probl`eme de l am elioration de l e cacit e energ etique dans les r eseaux sans l. Il est clair que l eventail des approches possibles `a ce probl`eme est enorme et cette th`ese a port e principalement sur les principes fondamentaux de la physique dans la premi`ere partie et sur les questions de conception au niveau du syst`eme dans la deuxi`eme partie. 1.5 limites fondamentales Dans la premi`ere partie de cette th`ese, nous avons con cu une exp erience de pens ee comme syst`eme de communication et calcul e la limite sup erieure de son e cacit e energ etique en utilisant la thermody- namique et de la th eorie electromagn etique. Avec l aide du mod`ele propos e, nous avons vu que pour un montant total donn e de l energie qui est disponible pour pr eparer, transmettre, et de r e ecrire des bits d information, il existe une transmission de fr equence d antenne unique qui donne une e cacit e energ e- tique maximale. Nous avons egalement constat e la d ependance de l e cacit e energ etique de la bande passante et l amplitude du signal, et qu il a un optimum `a des valeurs convenables pour les deux. Nous avons fait une comparaison de ces d ependances dans les cas de mod`ele de d ecalage de cl e de phase bi- naire et le mod`ele de d ecalage de cl e de phase en quadrature. Nos r esultats montrent que, contrairement aux r esultats de [28], lorsque le syst`eme de communication fonctionne `a une temp erature non nulle, la puissance optimale consomm ee par le syst`eme a n d optimiser l e cacit e energ etique est non nul. 1.5.1 Orientations futures Le traitement peut etre etendu et appliqu e `a di erents choix de syst`emes physiques pour stocker et transporter l information. Notre choix de bo tes de Szilard thermodynamiques et des ondes electromag- n etiques est dans l int er et d explorer les limites dans le domaine de la physique classique. Cependant, 5 1.6. Stochastic mod elisation bas ee sur la g eom etrie lorsque l on consid`ere les syst`emes d energie tr`es faible, les e ets de la m ecanique quantique pourrait etre plus prononc e et cela n ecessite une etude plus approfondie. `A l avenir, il peut etre int eressant d explorer d autres syst`emes physiques fondamentaux pour repr esenter bits. Par exemple: etats de spin quantique de particules, quantiques syst`emes thermodynamiques d ecrits m ecaniquement [29]. En outre, il est tr`es important d etudier les limites de l e cacit e energ etique d un dispositif de calcul de cette ligne d approche. Des etudes telles que [30] o`u les limites sur les co uts d energie de calcul sont explor ees sont d une grande importance dans le contexte actuel o`u la batterie untethered entra n e l informatique mobile est omnipr esent. Ces demandes de renseignements sur EE limites de calcul doivent nous conduire acqu erir un aper cu des limites m eme `a la couche MAC d un syst`eme de communication. 1.6 Stochastic mod elisation bas ee sur la g eom etrie Dans le chapitre 4, nous avons abord e l optimisation des APC dans les r eseaux cellulaires sans l `a palier unique dans lequel les emplacements de BSs sont mod elis es ont et e distribu es selon un homog`ene PPP. Sous forte BS politique de l association, nous avons tir e des bornes sur la puissance d emission optimale a n de garantir un certain taux de couverture et les donn ees minimum. Sous le m eme QoS contraintes, nous avons d eriv e la forme d expression ferm ee pour optimale BS densit e qui minimise la APC. A partir de ces r esultats, on constate que l existence d un tel optimale BS densit e d epend de la valeur de l exposant d a aiblissement de propagation. 1.6.1 Orientations futures Dans [31], les auteurs ont explor e la convexit e de la fonction couverture de probabilit e pour le mod`ele g en eral de pathloss unbounded. Cette analyse pourrait etre report e vers l optimisation de la APC et de telles mesures. Mod elisation BS d eploiements selon un uniforme PPP est une g en eralisation peu id ealiste. Dans des sc enarios r eels, BSs peut etre vu d eploy e dens ement `a un seul endroit et relativement rarement dans d autres endroits. Prendre ce genre de regroupement des densit es vari ees `a des emplacements spatiaux vari es et la r ealisation des EE optimisations est un probl`eme int eressant. Backhaul (longueur de la bre optique etc) co uts peuvent egalement etre incorpor es dans le mod`ele du syst`eme et etudi e comment cela va a ecter les param`etres syst`eme optimaux tels que BS densit e, etc. 1.7 Caching dans les r eseaux cellulaires unique de niveau Dans le chapitre 5, nous avons etudi e comment int egrant des capacit es de mise en cache `a la BSs in ue sur la consommation d energie dans les r eseaux cellulaires sans l. L adoption d un d etail BS mod`ele de puissance et la mod elisation de la BS emplacements selon un PPP, nous avons calcul e les expressions pour le APC et EE, qui sont en outre simpli ee dans le r egime `a faible bruit. Une observation cl e de ce travail est que cache-enabled BSs peut diminuer de mani`ere signi cative le APC et d am eliorer la EE par rapport `a traditionnelle BSs. Nous avons egalement observ e que l existence d un point de consommation d energie optimale pour le APC d epend de l exposant de pathloss. 6 1.8. Caching dans les r eseaux cellulaires `a deux niveaux 1.7.1 Orientations futures Les aspects de l energie et les implications de la mise en cache dans les r eseaux cellulaires sans l, en particulier pour 5G systemes, sont d un int er et pratique et en temps opportun et clairement besoin d une enqu ete plus approfondie. Les travaux futurs peuvent inclure des sc enarios de r eseau h et erog`enes, y compris les petites cellules, les cellules macro et acc`es WiFi points de d eploiement. En outre, le stockage du contenu populaire exige une estimation pr ecise de la distribution de la popularit e du contenu, qui ne peut etre r ealis ee facilement dans la pratique et peut co uter l energie en termes de puissance de traitement. Par cons equent, plut ot que de compter sur cette approche, les politiques de mise en cache randomis ees dans un sc enario stochastique [32] peut etre consid er e comme un moyen de fournir des indications nettes sur les avantages de l e cacit e energ etique de la mise en cache dans les r eseaux sans l denses. En outre, la distribution de popularit e peut etre consid er ee comme une fonction de localisation spatiale comme il est raisonnable de supposer que ce qui est populaire `a un endroit peut ne pas etre populaire ailleurs. `A la lumi`ere de cela, il est logique de prendre l ensemble du processus de mise en cache `a un d etail a n de faire un commentaire rigoureuse si la mise en cache est une solution e cace de l energie ou non. [33], enqu ete sur le probl`eme de la mise en place de cache optimale au bord sans l pour r eduire au minimum le taux de transmission dans des r eseaux h et erog`enes. 1.8 Caching dans les r eseaux cellulaires `a deux niveaux Dans le chapitre 6 nous avons propos e un syst`eme `a deux niveaux h et erog`enes, un Macro Base Stations (MBSs) (sans mise en cache des capacit es) et un SBSs (avec des capacit es de mise en cache), nous avons d e ni plusieurs param`etres importants du syst`eme et provenant de leurs expressions. Nous choisissons APC et EE comme deux mesures raisonnables pour optimiser a n de minimiser la consommation d energie dans un r eseau. Prenant x et Px (SBS densit e et transmettre la puissance respectivement) soient les variables, nous avons eu quatre probl`emes d optimisation ind ependants `a e ectuer. Nous avons impos e les contraintes C1-5 et avons d ecouvert que APC est une fonction convexe dans x et Px. Etant donn e que les equations impliqu ees sont compliqu ees `a trouver les expressions analytiques exactes pour les valeurs optimales, nous d ecouvrons les intervalles au sein de laquelle les optima peut etre trouv ee. Pour une valeur de syst`eme donn e, cependant, un optimum peut etre trouv e `a l aide de m ethodes num eriques. Imposer les contraintes C1-5, nous avons d ecouvert que EE est une fonction concave par rapport `a x et une fonction monotone d ecroissante par rapport `a Px. Nous avons trouv e la limite sup erieure pour optimale x pour lesquels EE prend la valeur de cr ete. 1.8.1 Orientations futures Dans les travaux futurs, il peut etre int eressant de comparer les deux valeurs optimales de SBS densit e - celui qui minimise le APC et celui qui maximise la EE, et de v eri er lequel des deux m etriques est relativement plus b en e que sur le plan economique et en termes de consommation d energie. Le choix de travailler avec deux niveaux (macro et petite) a et e arbitraire et ce traitement peut etre g en eralis ee `a un syst`eme `a plusieurs niveaux (comme dans [34]) chacun avec un autre type de la capacit e de mise en cache. Prenant la consommation d energie `a chaque etape du processus de mise en cache du contenu des utilisateurs `a la SBSs en compte, nous donne une prise plus compl`ete sur les facteurs in uen cant l e cacit e energ etique et laissant ainsi nous optimisons judicieusement. 7 1.8. Caching dans les r eseaux cellulaires `a deux niveaux 8 Chapter 2 Introduction 2.1 Background and Motivation Fueled by the ubiquity of new wireless devices and smart phones, as well as the proliferation of bandwidth- intensive applications, past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the usage and demand for mobile con- nectivity. The seamless demand for wireless data by rich media applications and services often associated with video streaming and social networking on smartphones and other wirelessly connected computing devices is expected only to increase further and more rapidly [2] in coming years. One crucial challenge for next-generation networks is to be able to support the predicted increase in the tra c in a sustain- able and economically viable way. In addition to ensuring connectivity to the users, monitoring energy expenditure (thereby the resulting carbon footprint) is also of great importance from both enocomic and environmental points of view. Energy expenditure shall either be minimized or be utilized as e ciently as possible. Despite the resemblance, the two problems aren t the same. To explain this in general terms: Imagine that a car has a fuel tank of xed size. Its engine may be manufactured either such that it travels a long distance but at a compromised speed or such that it goes at an impressive speed while the distance it can travel is shorter. Clearly, there is a tradeo between the two cases and, instead of being straightforward, de ning EE depends on the speci c utility we seek out of a system. In the context of wireless telecommunications, EE is often de ned in the literature as the ratio between the total data rate and the total power consumed at the transmitter. Maximizing the EE does ensure that the energy is usefully spent, but it is still important to keep in mind that achieving this maximum should not surpass our budget limitations. There have been studies addressing this subject from di erent directions. In [3], optimization of EE of a MIMO point-to-point link is studied in cases when imperfect CSI is available only at the transmitter and is available only at the receiver end. In [4], EE is optimized with respect to the number of antennas in MIMO system, where a realistic power consumption model at each BS has been taken into account. In [5], the density of access points (APs), number of antennas and users per AP, and transmission power have been optimized for maximal EE. Works of Li Chang et al, (see [6], for example) study EE aspects of small cell networks in terms of BS densities and power cost at the BSs. The GreenTouch consortium recently1 released a white paper [7] on the Green Meter Research study that claims that it is possible through a combination of changes in technologies, architectures, components, algorithms and protocols to reduce the net energy consumption in end-to-end communications networks by up to 98% by 2020 compared to the 2010 reference scenario de ned by GreenTouch. According to this a 10,000-fold increase of energy e ciency in mobile access networks is possible by incorporating changes in the existing technologies, architectures, components, algorithms and protocols. Concerning mobile access networks, among the 1June 18, 2015 9 2.2. The physical aspects of wireless transfer of information proposed list of ideas are: Beyond Cellular Green Generation (BCG2): Splitting data and signaling between two overlapping layers and incorporating on-demand connectivity has been shown to be an energy e cient solution. Large Scale Antenna Systems (LSAS): Instead of serving mobile terminals by means of bulky antennas that radiate power in sectors, this technique tries to direct power to user where it is needed. This is achieved by utilizing a large number of physically small, low-power, individually controlled antennas to create a multiplicity of user-selective beams of data. The data-bearing power is therefore only directed where it is needed and avoids unnecessary interference. While these results seem promising, further analysis still needs to be done to broaden the number of possibilities of achieving energy e cient next generation wireless network technologies. Since there may not be a universally valid and viable remedy to step up towards green technologies, this search is crucial. The present thesis comes in the context of exploring various possibilities of increasing energy e ciency in wireless networks. 2.2 The physical aspects of wireless transfer of infor- mation From a fundamental point of view, it has long been known that the process of communication always has a cost in terms of energy [8 10]. In 1948, Shannon published his revolutionary paper [11] in which the conditions under which information can be communicated reliably are mathematically quanti ed. It is of great interest to address this speci c point again but from the perspective of energy expenditure taking information creation and processing into account. In its colloquial sense, information is an abstract concept and is often considered subjective. However, in its objective sense information precisely means an ensemble of suitable array of physical systems prepared in desired states. The physical nature of information is discussed in [12]. To give some examples: A text message written on a piece of paper with a pencil is but one among several possible arrangements of an ensemble of carbon molecules in the two dimensional plane of a paper. An audio le inscribed on a compact disk is essentially a collection of pits and bumps engraved on it in a unique order. Braille scribed on a paper, signals such as smoke rings, drums, sirens etc are all quanti able physical entities and they all involve utilization of energy during their creation, propagation amd destruction. If a chosen physical system has two distinct states the information represented by such a system is called a bit. It has been shown that a large amount of information may be represented in terms of enough number of such bits [11]. Preparing a physical system in a state, or to change its state from one to another requires energy. While there may be countless possibilities for physical systems that can be used in preparing, changing and storing the given information, the choice of the system does decide how much energy is needed to perform these operations. The rst question we pose in this part of thesis addresses this point. In an attempt to explore the answer to the question: What is the most energy e cient choice of physical systems to represent and process information? , we begin with a simple thermodynamic system (section 3.2.1) to represent an information bit. In the realm of classical physics this is indeed the cheapest way of storing bits from energy perspective. In Chapter 3, we discuss in detail how energy is spent in preparing and processing (operations on) such bits. The process in which physical systems are prepared in desired states are transported from the trans- mission point to the reception point in space and time through a medium is called information transfer. 10 2.3. Architectural analysis of energy expenditure in wireless communication This is a physical process and hence requires energy. The correlation between the array of states sent and the array of states received is what determines the quality of information transfer. This correlation may be distorted due to interference from the physical world (noise), and such a distortion is quanti ed as error. There exists a trade o between the amount of energy spent at the transmission point and the mutual information (between the received states and the transmitted states) that can be achieved. Another question we pose in the rst part of this thesis addresses this point. In an attempt to explore the answer to the question: What is the limit on the e ciency of a communication system taking information creation into account? , we design a system to convert the information represented by the above men- tioned thermodynamic bits into electromagnetic waves to reach the reception, and evaluate the energy e ciency of the system. We are particularly interested in evaluating energy e ciency in communicating one bit of information as a limiting case (section 3.4.4). Contrary to the intuitive notion that e ciency can be arbitrarily increased by increasing energy investment, our results show that excess expenditure of energy does not necessarily have to be an e cient solution in point-to-point communication. This approach is important not just for the wireless service providers but also from the point of view of the users of wireless devices who are often compromised by the annoyance of frequently charging batteries of the mobile devices. As a matter of fact this part of the work comes in lines of exploring fundamental aspects of computation as well as communication. 2.3 Architectural analysis of energy expenditure in wireless communication Stochastic geometry based modeling The increasing demand for connectivity, data rate, and quality of service (QoS) cannot be satis ed merely by increasing inde nitely the transmit power of the base stations BSs. This is mainly due to the fact that an increase in transmit power, besides increasing the signal strength from the desired BS, also increases the interference received by the non-serving BSs. This may e ectively decrease the signal-to- interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) experienced by the user terminal, thus having a negative impact on the QoS. Besides that, it is also essential from an energy e ciency perspective to address the problem of minimizing the energy expenditure while maintaining certain constraints such as target coverage and minimum data rate. There are various approaches to address the problems of reducing energy consumption theoretically. For instance, if a nite number of BSs are deployed in a regular hexagonal (or grid) cellular fashion as in Figure 4.2 [13], one might seek to minimize the total power consumed by obtaining the optimal operating parameters, such as the hexagonal cell size and the magnitude of transmit power at each BS, while guaranteeing a certain QoS. Nevertheless, this approach involves cumbersome analysis as evaluating the spatial distribution of the SINR in a grid-based model becomes prohibitively complex as the system size increases and one may have to resort to extensive simulations. A common simpli cation in modeling cellular networks which enables us handle the problem analytically is to assume that the locations of BSs are randomly scattered on a two dimensional plane surface according to a homogeneous PPP [14]. Several works studied the validity of PPP modeling of BSs (in comparison with regular cellular models,) and it is often shown to provide useful insights into the statistical behavior of key performance metrics [15]. Some researchers, particularly those with an industry background, often express scepticism about using stochastic geometry for performance analysis of wireless cellular networks. Their prime accusation is that in a treatment based of stochastic geometrical modeling one neglects the actual deployment of BSs and focuses instead on the theoretical BS con gurations. It needs to be stressed at this point that the purpose of using stochastic geometry is not to solve any actual real-life deployed con guration of a collection of BSs, but to acquire qualitative as well as quantitative insights on some crucial system parameters with the help of tractable mathematical formalism rather than depending on system speci c simulations. This 11 2.3. Architectural analysis of energy expenditure in wireless communication has been stressed enough in the works of Andrews et al. More recent results on stochastic analysis of wireless cellular networks can be found in [16 20] and references therein. Is caching an energy e cient solution? Both academia and industry are now in an urge of evolving traditional cellular networks towards the next-generation broadband mobile networks, coined as 5G networks, targeting to satisfy the mobile data tsunami while minimizing expenditures and energy consumption. Among these intensive e orts, caching users content locally at the edge of the network is considered as one of the most disruptive paradigms in 5G networks [21]. Interestingly yet not surprisingly, recent results have shown that distributed content caching can signi cantly o oad di erent parts of the network, such as in RANs and CN, by smartly prefetching and storing content closer to the end-users [22]. Indeed, traditional cellular networks, which have been designed for mobile devices with limited processing and storage capabilities, have started incorporating context-aware and proactive capabilities, fueled by recent advancements in processing power and storage. As a result, caching has recently taken the 5G literature by storm. Caching in Single tier cellular networks As mentioned earlier, energy consumption aspects of cellular networks are usually investigated by placing BSs on a regular hexagonal or grid topology and conducting intensive system-level simulations [23]. Therein, the aim is to nd the optimal values of parameters, such as cell range and BS transmit power, while minimizing the total power consumed under certain QoS constraints. Despite its attractiveness, it is rather cumbersome or even impossible to analytically evaluate key performance metrics in large-scale networks. A common simpli cation in modeling cellular networks is to place the BSs on a two dimensional plane according to a homogeneous spatial PPP, enabling to handle the problem analytically [24]. Several works studied the validity of PPP modeling of BSs compared to regular cellular models (e.g. [25]) and additional insights can be obtained by analytically characterizing performance metrics, such as the spatial distribution of SINR, coverage probability, and average rate [18,19]. More recently, optimization of EE has been addressed quite well in the works of Emil et al such as [26]. In this thesis we analyze (see Chapter 5) energy consumption aspects of cache-enabled wireless single- tier network deployments using a spatial model based on stochastic geometry. We consider the problem of optimizing APC and EE of cache-enabled BSs in a scenario where BSs and mobile users are distributed according to independent homogeneous PPPs. We provide conditions under which the area power con- sumption is minimized subject to a certain quality of service (QoS) in terms of coverage probability. Furthermore, we provide the optimal BS transmit power that maximizes the energy e ciency, de ned as the ratio of area spectral e ciency over the total power consumed. The main result of this analysis is that distributed content caching in wireless cellular networks turns out to be an energy e cient solution. Caching in heterogeneous networks Wireless cellular networks of the future are likely to be heterogeneous, i.e. have one or more tiers of small cells overlaid on the macrocellular tier. Works such as [27] study EE in a HetNet scenario with sleeping strategies incorporated within. Motivated to progress in this line of research, we extend the idea of caching users content in one (or more) of tiers in a HetNet and study how this in uences the energy consumption aspects of the wireless system. We de ne and solve problems of optimizing APC and EE with respect to base station densities and their transmit powers. In Chapter 6, we analyze energy consumption aspects of two-tier wireless network, where the small cells are cache-enabled. 12 2.4. Thesis Outline 2.4 Thesis Outline This thesis consists of two parts. The rst part, comprises Chapter 3, and the second part comprises of Chapters 4, 5, and 6. Chapter 3 focuses on fundamental aspects of energy consumption in wireless communication where we use tools from thermodynamics and electromagnetic theory to make interesting observations regarding the energy e ciency of a simple wireless telecommunication device. The chapter is organized as follows: In Section 3.2, we elaborate on the communication system that we intend to study. In Section 3.4, we discuss the energy e ciency of the proposed system that uses Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK). In Section 3.5, we extend our analysis to higher constellations by comparing the present case with that of Quadrature Phase-Shift Keying (QPSK). In Section 3.6, we make plots of energy e ciency of the proposed system and comment on its behavior for cases of BPSK and QPSK signaling. In the second part of this thesis, we study the architectural limitations on the energy e ciency. In Chapter 4 we use tools from stochastic geometry to model wireless network systems and carry out a performance analysis. The chapter is organized as follows: In Section 4.2, we present the network model and motivate the optimization problem. In Section 4.3, we provide bounds on the optimal transmit power to minimize the area power consumption under minimum coverage and rate constraints. In Section 4.4, we evaluate the optimal BS density that minimizes the area power consumption. validation of the theoretical results by comparing with those of a numerical simulation are given in Section 4.5. Section 4.6 presents the concluding remarks. In Chapter 5, we extend this analysis by studying how caching users content at the edge of the network can in uence the over all energy e ciency of the system. The chapter is organized as follows: In Section 5.2 we describe our system model and introduce a detailed power model capturing caching and QoS constraints. We then formulate the problem of minimizing the area power consumption in Section 5.3. Results on the optimal power that maximizes the EE are provided in Section 5.4. Section 5.5 presents the concluding remarks. In Chapter 6, we extend the study of energy consumption aspects of a system with BSs endowed with caching capabilities to a HetNet scenario. The chapter is organized as follows: In Section 6.2 we describe the model according to which the two kinds of BSs are deployed and we de ne the connection policy of the User Terminals (UTs). In Subsection 6.2.1 we explain the caching model which is slightly di erent from the one used in Chapter 5. In Section 6.3, we de ne and derive anaytical expressions of key system metrics that we use later in the chapter. Subsection 6.3.1 gives details of the power model describing various components of power consumed as part of signaling and operation of a BS. In Section 6.4 we present the main results of the work where we de ne the problems of optimizing APC and EE with respect to spatial density and transmit power of SBSs separately. In Section 6.5, we present the numerical results to validate the theoretical results. Section 6.6 presents the concluding remarks. 2.5 Publications Journal Articles B. Perabathini, E. Ba stu g, M.

Shannon s work laid the de nition of information for communication networks. Works such as [8 10] explored on the physical nature of information and that energy expenditure is inevitable in processing and communicating information. Shannon s channel capacity theorem gives us an upper bound of the rate at which information can be transmitted over a communication channel for a xed signal strength. The converse of this result should address the question of nding the upper bound of signal strength that enables us transmit a given amount of information. The question gets much more interesting if the energy invested in creation, transfer as well as processing of the information is taken into account while nding this upper bound. In this chapter, we explore these physical limits of successful information transfer in a point-to-point communication system. In interest of studying the upper bound on the energy usage imposed by physics on communication systems in general, we model a simple generic system that enables us to make some basic inquiries about the energy e ciency in information creation, transfer as well as processing. We use ideas from thermodynamics such as Szilard engine to represent information bits. We further use ideas from electromagnetic theory for transfer of information, and information theory to de ne the energy e ciency metric. We nd the upper limit of this e ciency and conditions at which it can be achieved. 3.2 Proposed point-to-point communication system Figure 3.1 is the schematic representation of a typical communication system, where it has been shown that information takes three (abstract, storable and communicable) forms during a typical process of communication. In order to model a communication system at its most basic physical form, we rst look at how information itself can be physically represented. Secondly, we look at how this information can be extracted from the physical system and converted to electromagnetic waves. Finally, this signal is received by a physical antenna and stored as thermodynamic information at the receiver. What we call information here is the source coded form of raw information. We do not take into account the in uence of source coding on the e ciency. 17 3.2. Proposed point-to-point communication system Figure 3.1: A schematic picture of a typical communication system. Abstract information, that is saved in a physical form, is converted to some other suitable physical form in order to perform the information transfer. Numbers 1,2 and 3 represent information in the three (abstract, storable and communicable) forms. 3.2.1 Thermodynamic representation of information Consider an isolated cylindrical container of gas molecules in equilibrium. Now consider that an insulating wall with a small door is introduced in the middle. Maxwell postulated that a small demon that can operate this door can cause a violation of second law of thermodynamics by allowing gas molecules with high speeds pass in one direction and slow ones in the other direction. This is due to the fact that transferring heat between systems that are mutually at thermal equilibrium without doing any work violates second law of thermodynamics [35, 36]. Szilard resolved this paradox by arguing based on the proposition that destruction of physical information creates entropy in the environment . For the demon to create such a temperature di erence, without disturbing the system, it should to have an in nite memory at hand. Because having nite memory restricts the amount of information that can be stored at a given time and therefore excess information obtained by observing positions and velocities of several molecules would have to be destroyed continuously. This destruction of information would have dissipated energy back into the environment (container). This dissipated energy would in turn have increased the net disorder in the system contradicting Maxwell s prediction that the demon would actually decrease it [37 39]. An engine that Szilard used to illustrate the above idea, consists of a single molecule of an ideal gas in a cylindrical vessel with an adiabatic friction less piston locked in the middle separating it into two halves. The single molecule has two distinct physical states (left/right of the box) and therefore can represent one bit of information. To destroy this information, this system is brought in contact with a thermal reservoir at the same temperature as the molecule and the piston is unlocked. As a result the molecule jitters back and forth and repeatedly kicks the wall until the wall reached the other end of the container. Finally the molecule s position is totally randomized and the information about its location is destroyed with the help of heat drawn from the reservoir. Since the internal energy of the molecule has 18 3.2. Proposed point-to-point communication system Figure 3.2: Point-to-Point communication scheme. not changed, the excess work is dissipated into the environment. Heat dissipated in destroying a bit (Qdissip.) which is the work done by the molecule (Wmol.) to push the volume from V/2 to V in an isothermal limit, using the ideal gas law PV = kT is given by [40] Qdissip. = Wmol. = V Z V/2 P dV = V Z V/2 kT dV V = kT ln 2, (3.1) where k = 1.381 10 23J/K is the Boltzmann constant. It has to be noted that the time taken to push the piston ( ) at a given temperature depends on the size of the container V . Note that cannot be in nitely small unless V is in nitely small in which case quantum e ects have to be taken into account [29]. We use a modi cation of Szilard engine as shown in Figure 3.3 in our model. There are two pos- sible states for such a system. The Bernoulli random variable corresponding to each state is Pright := 1{Probability[X > L ] = 0}, where X is the x coordinate of the position of the molecule, L is the horizontal dimension of the box, is any arbitrarily small positive number. Clearly Pright {0, 1}. 1. State 0: The piston is pushed to the extreme end and the information about the location of the molecule is totally randomized. There is no mechanical energy that can be derived out of this system (Pright = 0). 2. State 1: The molecule is con ned in the left half and the piston is pushed to the middle from the right. A mechanical energy of at least kT ln 2 can be derived out of it (Pright = 1). We say that these systems come in state 0 by default and we spend energy kT ln 2 in creating state 1. The two states together represent one bit of information which we here on wards refer to as the Thermal-bit.1 A certain amount of raw information that is sampled and converted into necessary number of bits (0 s and 1 s) can be physically represented using a tape (an array) of Thermal-bits as shown in Figure 3.4. 19 3.2. Proposed point-to-point communication system Figure 3.3: The Thermal Bit. Figure 3.4: Information as a tape of thermodynamic bits. Figure 3.5: Communication device. 20 3.2. Proposed point-to-point communication system 3.2.2 Transmission setup Figure 3.5 depicts the communication device that we intend to study in the subsequent sections. Part T of the system is the transmission setup and R is the reception setup. We intend to send n bits of information from T to R which a distance r apart in space. For a very large n it maybe assumed that the source generates as many bits in state 0 as in state 1. That implies that the probability of having either of them is 1/2. The Transmission Setup consists of an ideal AC power source (with no internal resistance) connected to a wire loop antenna of radius b. There is a switching mechanism S at the bottom and works as follows: 1. A tape of Thermal-bits is fed into the switching mechanism. Each time a bit enters in, it remains in S for seconds before the next bit enters. 2. If a bit enters the switch in state 1, mechanical energy is extracted out of it and is used to open the switch of the circuit and keeps it so for the time until the bit is replaced by the next one. The amount of mechanical energy extracted out of each Thermal-bit is given by eq. (3.1). Whereas, if it is a Thermal-bit in state 2 that enters in, the switch remains closed for seconds until the next bit enters. Each time the switch is closed, current from the AC source ows through the loop antenna and an electromagnetic eld is radiated (magnetic dipole radiation). Let us represent the kth bit to be sent by ak, a Bernoulli random variable of probability 1/2. Therefore, depending on ak, the switch remains either closed or open each for a period of time . The current signal through the loop can be written as I(t) = I0(t) cos( ct), where I0(t) = I0 P k akS(t k ) with I0 as the amplitude of the AC current, c is the carrier frequency and S represents a square wave of period . We assume that the switching time 2 / c. Information that has been stored in the form of Thermal-bits thus far is now converted into a series of electromagnetic pulses. These pulses travel at the speed of light and each pulse has a time length of . The phase di erence between the pulses is what represents the information making it a BPSK signal. 3.2.3 Reception setup Reception setup consists of a wire loop receiving antenna (radius b) attached in series to a resistor (Figure 3.5). The resistance of this resistor is adjusted/chosen such that the total impedance of the receiving antenna matches the free space impedance. By this, we can safely assume that all the power that reaches the antenna is absorbed in the form of induced electromotive force (EMF) which in turn is ampli ed and then completely converted into heat at the resistor. A switching mechanism S is located at the bottom. It works as follows: 1. A tape of thermal bits created in states 1 is sent in. 2. Each time the Thermal-bit is kept in contact with the resistor for a time allowing heat to transfer. 3. If the temperature of the resistor TR T, the piston of the Thermal-bit will be pushed out creating a bit in state 0. 1Similar Thermal-bits can be prepared with systems with any number of molecules and not necessarily just one. Nevertheless, we deliberately choose single molecule systems as a limiting case. 21 3.2. Proposed point-to-point communication system Figure 3.6: Magnetic dipole [1]. Figure 3.7: Information as a series of electromagnetic pulses. 22 3.3. Remarks on the limitations of using Szillard boxes 3.3 Remarks on the limitations of using Szillard boxes Following the transmission as well as the receiver setups described in the previous section, our model requires that the thermal-bit stays in contact with the thermal reservoir for exactly seconds and it has been assumed that this amount of time is enough for the particle to make repeated collisions with the piston and eventually push it signi cantly forward. There are two issues that need to be taken into account here: 1. The particle inside the thermodynamic box (Fig 3.3) hits the piston with a certain probability and therefore, there is a non-zero probability that it never hits the piston within the time period . This may actually lead to an error during the process of reading the bit. In our theoretical treatment, we assumed the probability of not hitting the piston to be negligible. But a more rigorous analysis would actually consider the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution of the particle inside the box and evaluate the probability that the particle hits the piston within the time and study the signi cance of its e ects on the energy e ciency limits calculated in the subsequent sections. 2. The particle loses some of its kinetic energy each time it hits the piston since (unlike in ideal cases) the piston also has a certain mass. The idea of keeping the thermal bit in contact with the reservoir is that the particle would redraw kinetic energy as it hits the bottom wall which is in contact with the reservoir (Fig 3.3). Here again, there is a nite chance that the particle fails to hit the bottom wall at least once within the time period . A more complete treatment would take this issue into account. We defer including these aspects to future work. 3.4 The energy e ciency limit In this section, we derive the equations for the energy consumed by the communication system and the achievable rate of the system proposed in 3.2. With the following theoretical treatment, we nally calculate the fundamental limits on energy e ciency of a physical system that communicates with elec- tromagnetic waves. 3.4.1 The signaling system We know that the magnitude of the Poynting vector generated by a magnetic dipole, as de ned in the previous section, at a distance r from the dipole and at an angle with vertical axis (Figure 3.6), making the assumptions b r, b c c and r c c , is given by | S| = 0 c m0(t) 2 c 4 c sin r cos( c(t r/c)) 2 (3.2) where c = 3 108ms 1 is velocity of light and m0(t) = b2I0(t) is the maximum dipole of the loop [1]. We nd the average of the power density over the time period of one complete wave cycle 0 = 2 c . 23 3.4. The energy e ciency limit S =  0b4 4 c sin2 16r2c3  I2 0 Eak, 0[( X k akS(t k ))2 cos2( c(t r/c))] =  0b4 4 c sin2 16r2c3  I2 0 E 0 h [ X k =l E[akal]S(t k )2 + X k E[a2 k]S(t k )2] cos2( c(t r/c)) i . Since ak {0, 1} with probability 1/2 each and that ak s are not correlated, we hence have that, E[ak]E[al] = 1/4 and E[a2 k] = 1/2, which gives S =  0b4 4 c sin2 16r2c3  I2 0 3 4E 0 h X k S(t k )2 cos2( c(t r/c)) i . By using the assumptions that 0 and that S(t k ) is either 0 or 1, we get S =  0b4 4 c sin2 16r2c3  I2 0 3 4.1 2 = 3 0b4 4 c sin2 128r2c3  I2 0. (3.3) The total radiating power emitted by the antenna is obtained by integrating Eq (3.3) over the surface area of any sphere surrounding the loop. Therefore the average energy per bit emitted by the transmission setup during one operation for time (that is for bit in state 0) is given by Erad T = 3 0b4 4 cI2 0 128c3  Z 0 (sin )2 sin d 2 Z 0 d = 3 0b4 4 cI2 0 128c3  8 3 = 4 cI2 0, (3.4) where =  0 b4 16c3  . 3.4.2 Energy considerations at Transmission Setup In the whole process of transmitting n bits of information, we like to evaluate the total amount of energy spent in the Transmission Setup. We have shown earlier that the energy required for an operation on state 1 to switch it to state 0 is kT ln 2 and an operation on state 0 costs zero energy. And by the assumption that the states are equally probable, we can say that an operation on a Thermal-bit on an average costs an energy of 1 2kT ln 2. Therefore, the average amount of energy required to read a total of n Thermal-bits would be Ebits T = n 2 kT ln 2 joules. 24 3.4. The energy e ciency limit To emit all the bits, the radiator must have been operated n/2 times and for time each time. Therefore the fundamental lower bound on the total energy spent is: Etot T (n) := n[ 4 cI2 0 + 1 2kT ln 2]. (3.5) 3.4.3 Energy considerations at Receiver Setup Equation (3.3) gives the magnitude of the Poynting vector at a distance r from the transmitting antenna. We assume that both transmitting and receiving loops are in the same plane ( = 0). Assuming that all the power absorbed into the loop is equal to the product of the magnitude of the Poynting vector and the area b2, the received signal energy on average per bit is given by E0 R := 3 0b4 4 cI2 0 128r2c3 b2 = 4 cI2 0, (3.6) where = 3 0 b6 128r2c3 . If we assume that the distance is large, i.e. for large enough r, the sum of received energy per bit and the channel noise can be much less than the energy needed to write a bit at the reception end, i.e. E0 R 1 2kT ln 2. In this case, in order to write a bit into the tape at the receiver, the received non-zero signal will be ampli ed by an ampli er that has to supply an average total energy (for all n bits) Etot R (n) := n 2 kT ln 2. (3.7) Finally, we de ne the total energy cost of preparing a Thermal-bit transmitting it electromagneti- cally constructing it back at the receiver as (from eq. (3.5) and eq. (3.7)) E0 tot = Etot T (n = 1) + Etot R (n = 1) =  4 cI2 0 + 1 2kT ln 2  + 1 2kT ln 2 = 4 cI2 0 + kT ln 2. (3.8) 3.4.4 Energy E ciency The energy per bit to noise energy ratio snrb 0 is given as snrb 0 = E0 R N0W = 4 c W 2 I2 0 N0 , (3.9) where, I2 0 which is proportional to the energy spent by the AC source at T per bit, N0 is the noise spectral density, and W := 1 is the bandwidth where is the time length of each pulse. We know that the mutual information of BPSK channel as a function of snr0 is given by [41] Ib(snrb 0) = 1 ln 2  snrb 0 1 2 Z e y2 2 log  cosh(snrb 0 y q snrb 0)  dy  . (3.10) 25 3.5. Energy e ciency for higher constellations Finally, we de ne energy e ciency as the ratio b = WIb(snrb 0) E0 tot bits/s/J. By substituting snrb 0 from Eq (3.9), b( c) can be expressed as a function of c as b(W, c, I0, kT) = W( 4 cI2 0 W 2N0 1 2 R e y2 2 log  cosh( 4 c W 2 I2 0 N0 y q 4c W 2 I2 0 N0 )  dy) (ln 2)( 4cI2 0 W + kT ln 2) . (3.11) 3.5 Energy e ciency for higher constellations So far, we only considered the case where only one bit is encoded by one symbol. However, by making appropriate modi cations to the proposed setup and the scheme of phasing, one should in principle be able to encode any number of bits per symbol. Instead of caring for the details of the engineering, we focus on the energy considerations for the case of QPSK. The main di erence in the case of QPSK is that we have four symbols {11, 01, 10, 00} and the probability that the source produces a typical symbol ak is now assumed to be 1/4. This will result in the following changes: 1. The average energy per symbol emitted is 1 4(2Erad T + Erad T + Erad T + 0) = Erad T /2. 2. Similarly, the received signal energy on average per symbol E0 R is changed by a factor 1/2. 3. A thermal operation in this case is on two bits at once. The average energy spent on the a symbol is kT ln 2. Including the cost of operation at T and R makes the average energy spent per operation per symbol 2kT ln 2, which is twice the case compared to BPSK. The total energy spent on a symbol in preparing, transmitting and writing (analogous to Eq (3.8)), will be E0 tot = 2 4 cI2 0 + 2kT ln 2 (3.12) The energy per bit to noise energy ratio snrq 0 is given as snrq 0 = E0 R 2N0W = 4 c 2W 2 I2 0 N0 . (3.13) We know that the mutual information of QPSK channel as a function of snrq 0 is given by [41] Iq(snrq 0) = 1 ln 2  2snrq 0 r 2 Z e y2 2 log  cosh(snrq 0 y q snrq 0)  dy  . (3.14) 26 3.6. Numerical results Energy e ciency in this case is given as q(W, c, I0, kT) = W( 4 cI2 0 2W 2N0 q 2 R e y2 2 log  cosh( 4 cI2 0 2W 2N0 y q 4cI2 0 2W 2N0 )  dy) (ln 2)( 4cI2 0 2W + 2kT ln 2) . (3.15) Energy e ciency for any M-ary constellation can be theoretically determined along similar lines. However, the engineering of the setup and the scheme of phasing would become much more complicated. 3.6 Numerical results Equations (3.11) and (3.15) provide expressions on energy e ciency in the case of BPSK and QPSK, re- spectively. In this section, we numerically verify and compare the behavior of the functions b(W, c, I0, kT) and q(W, c, I0, kT). We use the values 0 = 4 10 7N A 2, c = 3 108ms 1, r = 1m and b = 1m to get the values of = 9.25926 10 34 and = 3.42695 10 33. In Figure 3.8 we plot b and q versus carrier frequency c for W = 1Hz, N0 = 1, kT = 1 and I0 = 1A. It can be seen that at lower frequencies, BPSK is more e cient that QPSK, but at higher frequencies, QPSK, is more e cient than BPSK. We numerically determine the optimal carrier frequencies from the plots as b = 1.57013 108Hz and q = 2.00214 108Hz. Figure 3.9 shows b and q against bandwidth W for optimal frequencies b = 1.57013 108Hz, q = 2.00214 108Hz, N0 = 1, kT = 1 and I0 = 1A. The energy e ciency approaches 0 when the bandwidth is in nitely large. Figure 3.10 shows b and q against square of the amplitude square of current I0 for W = 1Hz, N0 = 1, b = q = 108Hz and kT = 1 For low values of current (amplitude), BPSK is seen to be more e cient than QPSK, but for higher amplitudes QPSK is much more e cient than BPSK. While the analytical solution of the optimal frequency c is not trivial to compute analytically from Eq (3.11), a plot of ( c) vs c in gure 3.8 suggests that there exists an optimal frequency for a set of numerical values of the parameters at which the energy e ciency has its maximum. Figure 3.11 plots the optimal frequency c against temperature (kT) of the Thermal-bits in both cases of BPSK and QPSK for W = 1, N0 = 1 and I0 = 1A. Since temperatures cannot be arbitrarily small in classical conditions, this suggests that the optimal frequency cannot be arbitrarily small either. 3.7 Concluding remarks We devised a hypothetical communication system and calculated the upper bound on energy e ciency using electromagnetic and thermodynamic theory. We have seen that, in the proposed model, for a given total amount of energy that is at disposal to prepare, transmit and rewrite information bits, there exists a unique transmit antenna frequency that yields maximum energy e ciency. We have also seen the dependence of energy e ciency on the bandwidth and the amplitude of the signal, and that there is an optimum at operating point for the two. We have made a comparison of these dependencies in the cases of BPSK and QPSK models. Our results show that, contrary to the results in [28], when the communication system is operating at a non-zero temperature, the optimal power consumed by the system in order to maximize energy e ciency is non-zero. 27 3.7.

Concluding remarks 30 Part II Architectural Limits 31 Chapter 4 Energy Aspects of a Single-Tier Poisson Cellular Network 4.1 Overview In this chapter, we investigate the problem of minimizing the area power consumption in wireless cellular networks. We focus on the downlink of a single-tier network, in which the locations of base stations (BSs) are distributed according to a homogeneous Poisson point process (PPP). Assuming that a mobile user is connected to its strongest candidate BS, we derive bounds on the optimal transmit power in order to guarantee a certain minimum coverage and data rate. Under the same QoS constraints, we nd the optimal network density that minimizes the APC. Our results show that the existence of an optimal BS density for minimizing the power consumption depends on the value of the pathloss exponent. We begin by considering a single-tier cellular network in which the BS locations are modeled according to a homogeneous spatial PPP. We assume that a mobile user is connected to the BS that provides the highest SINR and we impose two QoS constraints, namely a target coverage probability and a target minimum average rate experienced by the typical user. We aim at deriving the optimal BS density that maximizes the power e ciency, i.e. minimizes the power consumption per unit area. Evidently, a network is power e cient if the area power consumption decreases with increasing the BS density or reducing the cell size. Most prior works analyzed the performance of single-tier or heterogeneous Poisson cellular networks in terms of energy e ciency [27, 42, 43]. The most related works to our single-tier analysis is [44], in which the authors analyze the impact of transmit power reduction on the area power consumption of the network under closest BS association. In this thesis, under strongest BS association, we derive bounds on the optimal transmit power in order to guarantee a certain minimum coverage and data rate. Under the same QoS constraints, we nd the optimal network density that minimizes the area power consumption, whose existence depends on the pathloss exponent and the target QoS guarantees. 4.2 System Model 4.2.1 Network model We consider the downlink of a single-tier cellular network, in which the locations of BSs are distributed on a two-dimensional Euclidean plane R2 according to a homogeneous PPP = {ri}i N with density b, where we denote by ri R2 the location of the i-th BS. We assume that the users are also randomly 33 4.2.

System Model distributed according to an independent PPP of density u, such that u b. Without loss of generality, we focus on a mobile (typical) user at the origin for calculating the performance metrics of interest, i.e. coverage probability and average rate. The total bandwidth is denoted by B and the bandwidth per user is given by Bu = B b u . We assume that all BSs transmit with the same constant power P and an additional operational power Po (e.g. due to hardware and signaling) is consumed at each BS. In such a system, the power expenditure per unit area (in W/m2), coined as APC, is given as P = b(P + Po). (4.1) We model the system under consideration such that the transmitted signal from a given BS is subject to two propagation phenomena before it reaches the user: (i) a distance-dependent pathloss governed by the pathloss attenuation function g(r) = br , where b is the pathloss coe cient and is the pathloss exponent (ii) Rayleigh fading with mean 1. According to the above assumptions and notation, the signal strength from i-th BS as received by the reference user is given as pi(ri) = hiPbr i . (4.2) We further assume the presence of noise in the medium with power variance 2 = b, with = B 1 u F kT b , where F is the receiver noise gure, k is Boltzmann constant, and T is the ambient temperature. If the reference user is connected to the i-th BS, it receives a signal of power pi(ri) from it. The sum of the received powers from the remaining BSs contributes to interference to this signal. As a result, the received SINR at the reference user when served by the i-th BS is given by SINR = hig(ri)P 2 + Ii , (4.3) where, Ii = P rj \ri pj(rj). In a downlink scenario, although the reference user can practically be served from any BS, a connection with a particular BS has to be established according to an association policy to ensure high SINR, which may have an impact on the APC optimization. In this thesis, we assume that a mobile user connects to the strongest BS, i.e. the BS that provides the maximum received SINR. The reference user is said to be covered when there is at least one BS that o ers an SINR > . If no BS o ers an SINR greater than this threshold, we say that the reference user is on coverage outage. We assume the condition > 1, which is needed to ensure that there is only one BS that serves the required level of SINR at a given instant [34]. 4.2.2 Problem formulation Our objective is to obtain the optimal BS density b and transmit power P so that the area power con- sumption b(P +P0) is minimized subject to a minimum coverage probability constraint and a minimum data rate guarantee. As stated above, the coverage probability, Pcov, is de ned as the probability that the reference user is covered. Following the aforementioned de nition, the coverage probability is given as the probability that the SINR received by the reference user on an average is greater than . The user data rate, R is de ned as the expectation value B b u E [log2 (1 + SINR)]. 35 4.3. Optimal power for target coverage and rate 4.3 Optimal power for target coverage and rate In this section we address the following optimization problem: arg min P (0, ) P = b(P + Po) s.t. (i) Pcov P NN cov (ii) R RNN + Rmin (4.4) where P NN cov and RNN are the coverage probability and the per-user rate, respectively at the no noise regime, and , are both positive and 1. Note that when the transmit power is in nity (no noise case), the coverage probability is scale invariant, i.e. the coverage probability and also the spectral e ciency do not depend on the BS density [14]. Lemma 1. If P c is the minimum transmit power that satis es the constraint Pcov P NN cov , then P c A1 2 1 b , where A1 = (1+ 2 ) bC 2 ( )(1 ) and C( ) = 2 2 cosec 2 . Proof. The coverage probability under strongest BS association for a general pathloss function g(r) is given as [34,45] Pcov(P, b) = P[SINR ] = b Z 0 exp( q( , b, r)) dr (4.5) where q(P, b, r) = 2 Pg( r) + b Z 0 g( ri) g( r) + g( ri) dri. (4.6) We use the standard power-law pathloss model g(r) = br and incorporate it in (4.6) and (4.5) to get the expression for coverage probability as Pcov(P, b) = b Z 0 exp  b r 2 Pb bC( ) 2 r  dr, (4.7) where C( ) := 2 2 cosec 2 . In the case of low noise ( 2 0), the above expression can be simpli ed by using the approximation e x 1 x. Pcov(P, b) b Z 0  1 br 2 Pb  e bC( ) 2 r dr = P NN cov 1 (1 + 2 ) Pb 2 1 b C 2 ( ) ! (4.8) where P NN cov := 2 C( ) is the coverage probability observed by the reference user in the case of negligible noise. Fig. 4.4 gives a justi cation to the above approximation by comparing the numerical plots of coverage probability before and after the approximation. By substituting the expression for Pcov from (4.8) into the constraint equation Pcov P NN cov we get a condition on the range of optimal transmit power P c as P c A1 2 1 b , (4.9) where A1 = (1+ 2 ) bC 2 ( )(1 ). This equation establishes the approximate minimum transmit power as a function of b that satis es the coverage constraint. 36 4.3. Optimal power for target coverage and rate Lemma 2. If P r is the minimum transmit power to satisfy R Rmin + RNN, then P r A2( ) 2 b , where A2( b) = 2 (1+ 2 ) bC 2 ( )(1 B b u ). Proof. The per-user rate is analytically given as R = B b u E[log2(1 + SINR)] = Rmin + B b u Z ln 2 P[SINR et 1] dt, (4.10) where Rmin is the minimum rate [34]. As in eq (4.10), the rate per BS experienced by the reference user is given by R = Rmin + B b u E[log(1 + SINR)] = Rmin + B b u Z t>ln 2 P[SINR > et 1] dt = Rmin + B b u b Z 0 Z ln 2 exp  2r 2 Pb (et 1) bC( )r(et 1) 2  dr dt Rmin + B b u  C( ) Z ln 2 (et 1) 2 dt 2 b Pb Z ln 2 (et 1) 2 (1 + 2 ) C1+ 2 ( ) 2 b dt  = Rmin + B b u RNN 1 (1 + 2 ) Pb 2 1 b C 2 ( ) ! (4.11) where RNN := 2 2 2 2F 1( 2 , 2 , 2+ , 1 2) C( ) , is the rate per user when the noise is negligible. By substituting the expression for rate R in the constraint equation R RNN + Rmin to get a condition on the optimal transmit power P r as P r A2( b) 2 1 b , (4.12) where A2( b) = (1+ 2 ) bC 2 ( )(1 u B b ). This equation establishes the approximate minimum transmit power as a function of b that satis es the rate constraint. It follows naturally that the optimal transmit power that satis es both the conditions (4.9) and (4.12) will therefore be P = max{P c , P r }. 37 4.4. Optimal BS density with approx.

The curves almost coincide for low values of . 4.4 Optimal BS density Since the objective of our optimization problem is to minimize the APC (P), we seek to minimize the function P( b) = (P + Po) b = max{A1, A2( b)} 2 1 b + Po b, (4.13) with respect to b. Following Eq (4.13), there are two possible expressions for P depending on which is larger between A1 and A2( b), which in turn depends on the value of b. We study the two cases A1 > A2( b) and A1 < A2( b) and proceed with the optimization of P with respect to b in each case. Case 1 If A1 > A2( b) then b [ u B , ) and the optimal transmit power P = P c . Therefore, the APC at optimal power follows as P( b) = (1 + 2 ) bC 2 ( )(1 ) 1 2 2 b + Po b. (4.14) This is clearly a convex function in b for > 2. Therefore, we di erentiate P( b) with respect to b and solve it for the optimum b, i.e. 38 4.5. Simulation Results dP( b) d b = 0 b =  (1 + 2 ) bC ( )(1 ) ( 2 2) Po  1 2 1 . (4.15) It can be noticed that b = 0 for = 4, which means that when = 4 the optimal BS density has only the trivial solution. We comment further on the relation between the existence of optimum and the pathloss exponent in Section 4.5, where we analyze (4.15) numerically and compare it with simulation. Case 2 If A1 < A2( b) then b (0, u B ] and the optimal transmit power P = P r . Therefore, the APC at optimal power follows as P( b) = (1 + 2 ) bC 2 ( )(1 u B b ) 1 2 2 b + Po b. (4.16) We nd again the optimum by equating the derivative with respect to b to zero, i.e. dP( b) d b = 0 Po p 2 b  1 b 2 +  1 2  p 2 /2 b 1 b = 0, (4.17) where p = (1+ 2 ) bC 2 ( ) and = u B . Now, (4.17) can be simpli ed to the follow equation in b: 2Po /2 b ( b )2 p( 4) 3 b + p ( 6) 2 b) = 0, (4.18) which is a polynomial for > 4. The existence of a real solution for the polynomial depends on the value of and the coe cients. 4.5 Simulation Results In this section, we numerically plot the results obtained in Sections 4.3 and 4.4 and validate them with respect to simulations of our system model. A general remark is that the theoretical results match perfectly the simulated ones. We set up a square of dimension 200km 200km and the reference user is placed at the center of the square. The number of BSs to be deployed is drawn as a Poisson random variable with its mean as the product of area of the square and the BS density ( b). The location coordinates of the BSs are drawn uniformly from the region of the square. Each BS is assumed to transmit at constant power and we choose the standard pathloss function g(ri) = r i . The reference user is placed at the center of the square and the received signals and interference powers are governed by (4.2), which includes the exponential random variable hi which is the Rayleigh fading factor. In every realization, we calculate the received SINR at the reference user. We compute the coverage probability as the proportion of the number of instances (out of 2000 realizations) in which the received SINR is greater the threshold . Similarly the average rate per user is computed as the average value of B b u log2(1+SINR) as experienced by the reference user. In Figs. 4.5 and 4.6, we plot the analytical results for the coverage probability and the per-user rate (cf. 4.5) and compare it with simulations. The two plots demonstrate that both these performance metrics asymptotically saturate to a constant value rather than increasing with BS transmit power increasing. This asserts that increasing transmit power of BSs may not always be the best solution to increase the 39 4.5. Simulation Results QoS. This further motivates us to search for the minimum amount of transmit power, which ensures a minimum level of QoS. In Fig. 4.7, we compare - the theoretically derived expression for the approximate optimum power P c ( b) given in (4.9), - the exact optimum P c , numerically evaluated through exhaustive search for the least value of P that satis es the coverage constraint of (4.4), and - the optimum P c evaluated using simulations, as functions of b. It can be noticed that the curves corresponding to theoretical exact minimum and the simulation coincide, whereas expectedly, the approximate theoretical result has a small gap with respect to the simulated exact result. Fig. 4.8 depicts a similar treatment as described in Fig. 4.7, but for the rate constraint of (4.4). It can be noticed that the curves corresponding to theoretical exact minimum and the simulation fairly coincide while the approximate theoretical result is slightly di erent, as expected. This again validates the correctness of our theoretical analysis. In Fig. 4.9, we plot for di erent values of , the theoretical expression for APC (P) (4.14) versus BS density ( b). We compare this with the simulation result where P is plotted against b for values of transmit power (P) that satisfy the constraints in (4.13). Since the bandwidth is reasonably large (of the order of 106 Hz), the region b (0, u B ] is very narrow and it does not have much of importance. Therefore, we only consider the region b [ u B , ) in our plots. We verify that P( b) has no minima for = 4 and it is negligibly small for = 3. This is a key message of our work, which dictates a relation between the pathloss exponent and the existence of a minima for the APC P. Furthermore, we observe that in the cases of = 5 and 6 deploying too few BSs is not an energy e cient solution. 40 4.6.

Using a low-noise approximation, we derived bounds on the minimum transmit power for achieving certain QoS constraints in terms of coverage and user rate. Based on these optimal transmit power values, we derived the optimal BS density that minimizes the area power consumption subject to minimum coverage probability and per-user rate guarantees. A takeaway message of this chapter is that the existence of an optimal BS density for optimizing area power e ciency depends on the speci c value of the pathloss exponent. When the pathloss exponent < 4, APC has no minimum value with respect to b and when > 4 there s always an optimal b at which the APC assumes a minimum. 41 4.6.

In this chapter, we focus on the energy consumption aspects of cache-enabled wireless cellular networks, speci cally in terms of area power consumption (APC) and energy e ciency (EE). We assume that both base stations (BSs) and mobile users are distributed according to homogeneous Poisson point processes (PPPs) and we introduce a detailed power model that takes into account caching. We study the conditions under which the area power consumption is minimized with respect to BS transmit power, while ensuring a certain quality of service (QoS) in terms of coverage probability. Furthermore, we provide the optimal BS transmit power that maximizes the area spectral e ciency per unit total power spent. The main takeaway of this analysis is that caching seems to be an energy e cient solution. The idea of caching at the edge of the network, namely at the level of BSs and UTs, have been highlighted in various works, including edge caching [46], FemtoCaching [47], and proactive caching [48]. Spatially random distributed cache-enabled BSs are modeled in [49], and expressions for the outage prob- ability and average delivery rate are derived therein. Another stochastic framework but in the context of cache-enabled Device-To-Device (D2D) communications is presented in [50], studying performance metrics that quantify the local and global fraction of served content requests. Additionally, multi-armed bandit problem under unknown content popularity [51], an approximation framework based on the fa- cility location problem [52], a many-to-many matching game formulation [53] and information-theoretic local and global caching gains [54] are studied. The performance of simple caching, replication and re- generating codes for D2D scenario [55], a joint content-aware user clustering and content caching [56] and joint optimization of power and cache control for cooperative MIMO [57] are investigated. Although most prior works (see [58] for a recent survey) deals with di erent aspects of caching, i.e. performance characterization and approximate algorithms, the energy consumption behavior of cache-enabled BSs in densely deployed scenarios has not been investigated. This is precisely the focus of this analysis. 45 5.2. System Model 5.2 System Model We consider the downlink scenario of a single-tier cellular network in which the BSs are distributed on the two-dimensional Euclidean plane R2 according to a homogeneous spatial PPP with density b denoted by b = {ri}i N, where ri R2 is the location of the i-th BS. The mobile UTs (or users) are modeled to be distributed on the same plane according to an independent homogeneous PPP with density u > b, which is denoted by u = {sj}j N with sj R2 being the location of the j-th user. Without loss of generality, we focus on a typical UT placed at the origin of the coordinate system for calculating the key performance metrics of interest. In this system model, we assume that the signal transmitted from a given BS is subject to two propagation phenomena before reaching a user: (i) a distance dependent pathloss governed by the pathloss function g(r) = br , where b is the pathloss coe cient and is the pathloss exponent, and (ii) Rayleigh fading with mean 1. Therefore, the signal strength from the i-th BS as received by the typical user can be expressed as pi(ri) = hiPbr i , (5.1) where the random variable hi denotes the power of Rayleigh fading and P is the transmitted power. In addition, we assume that background noise is present in the system, with variance 2 = b, with = B 1 u F kT b , where B is the total available bandwidth, F is the receiver noise gure, k is Boltzmann constant, and T is the ambient temperature. As alluded earlier, the typical user connected to the i-th BS receives a signal of power pi(ri). This in turn means that the sum of the received powers from the rest of the BSs contributes to the interference to this signal. As a result, the received SINR at the typical user is given by SINR = hig(ri)P 2 + Ii , (5.2) where Ii = P rj b\ri pj(rj) is the cumulative interference experienced from all the BSs except the i-th BS. In a downlink scenario, although the typical user may technically be served from any BS, a connection with a particular BS has to be established according to a association policy that satis es a certain performance metric, e.g. ensuring QoS. In this analysis, we assume that a mobile user connects to the BS that provides the maximum SINR. This is formally expressed as max ri bSINR(i) > , where is the target SINR. Given the above de nition, the typical user is said to be covered when there is at least one BS that o ers an SINR > . If not, we say that the typical user is not covered. We assume that > 1, which is needed to ensure that there is at maximum one BS that provides the highest SINR for a user at a given instant [59]. 5.2.1 Coverage Among the main objectives of wireless networks is to guarantee a certain QoS for the users. The choice of a speci c QoS metric in uences both the complexity and the operation of the network. In this chapter, we consider the fact that coverage probability is one measure of QoS as it is related with user experience and satisfaction. We impose a constraint to assure its value to be above a threshold limit. The coverage probability for strongest BS association for a general pathloss function g(r) is given as [31,59] Pcov(P, b) = P[SINR ] = b Z 0 exp( q(P, b, r)) dr, (5.3) 46 5.2. System Model where q(P, b, r) = 2 Pg( r) + b Z 0 g( ri) g( r) + g( ri) dri. (5.4) Denoting by P NN cov the coverage probability in the case of no noise ( 2 0), the expression for the coverage probability in (5.3) may be approximated in a low noise regime as [60] Pcov(P, b) = P NN cov 1 A 2 1 b 1 P ! , (5.5) where A = (1+ 2 ) b[C( )] 2 and C( ) = 2 2 csc   2  . The speci c constraint we consider here is that the coverage probability experienced by a typical user has to be always greater than the coverage probability achieved in the absence of noise, i.e. Pcov P NN cov . (5.6) As a consequence, it can be shown (from (5.5) and (5.6)) that the optimal BS density b that guarantees the above QoS constraint is b A P 2 2 , (5.7) with A = A 2 2 . We use this expression in the optimization problem we formulate in Section 5.3. Once the typical user is covered with a certain SINR, the tra c requests of this typical user have to be satis ed from its BS, by bringing the content from its source on the Internet via the backhaul. In practice, even though the typical user is covered and bene ts from high SINR, it is obvious that any kind of bottleneck in the backhaul may result into long delays to the content, degrading the overall quality of experience (QoE). As part of dealing with this bottleneck, we assume that the BSs are able to store the users (popular) content in their caches, so that requests can be satis ed locally, without passing over the limited backhaul. This is detailed in the following section. 5.2.2 Cache-enabled Base Stations Several studies have shown that multiple users actually access the same content very frequently. Take for instance some popular TV shows, the case of viral videos with over a billion viewings, news blogs, online streaming, etc. In this context, the network will be inundated with requests for the same content that might largely increase the latency or, eventually, congest the network itself. Otherwise stated, certain types of content (or information) are relatively more popular than others and are requested/accessed more often by the users [61]. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that a user s choice distribution matches with the global content popularity distribution. As mentioned before, the logic behind having cache-enabled BSs is to exploit this likelihood and store locally at the BSs serving a typical user the content with highest demand (popular demand) so that both users and service providers get an incentive when a popular request is made. Let us assume that each BS is equipped with a storage unit (hard disk) which caches popular content. Since the storage capacity cannot be in nite, we assume that at each BS a set of content up to f0 (the catalog) is stored on the hard disk. Rather than caching uniformly at random, a smarter approach would be to store the most popular content according to the given global content popularity statistics. We model the content popularity distribution at a typical user to be a right continuous and monotonically decreasing Probability Distribution Function (PDF), denoted as [62] fpop (f, ) = ( ( 1) f , f 1, 0, f < 1, (5.8) 47 5.2. System Model where f is a point in the support of the corresponding content, and represents the steepness of the popularity distribution curve. We de ne the steepness factor to be the (average) number of users per BS, that is = u b . The justi cation for the above model is that the higher the number of users attached to a BS, the more accurately the trend is sampled, hence the more content is sorted towards the left of the distribution thereby making it steeper. Moreover, since u > b, we have that > 1. Now, given the fact that BSs cache the catalog according to the content popularity distribution in (5.8), the probability that a content demanded by a connected user falls within the range [0, f0] is given by Phit = Z f0 0 fpop(f, ) df = Z f0 0 ( 1)f df = 1 f 1 0 . (5.9) It can be veri ed that Phit converges to 1 when f0 , namely when the catalog stored in the BSs goes to in nity. Consequently, the probability that a request is missing from the catalog can be expressed as Pmiss = f 1 0 . An illustration of the system model is given in Fig. 5.1, including snapshots of PPPs and visualization of the content popularity distribution. In the following, we introduce a power model which takes into account the caching capabilities at BSs, and will be used for investigating the energy aspects of cache-enabled BS deployment. base station i) mobile user terminals storage unit mobile user terminal mobile user ii) base stations downlink backhaul link content popularity distribution 1.1 2.0 3.0 8.0 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0 0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 f fpop f, Figure 5.1: An illustration of the considered system model. The snapshots of PPPs for i) mobile users and ii) base stations on unit area are given on the left side.

In this analysis, we deliberately restrict ourselves to a basic power model as a rst attempt to relate energy e ciency to a cache enabled wireless network. We address a more complete model in an extension of this analysis presented in Chapter 6. We consider two di erent power models depending on whether BSs have caching capabilities or not. 48 5.3. Area Power Consumption With caching The components of the total power consumed at an operating BS is given as follows: i) A constant transmit power, P. ii) An operational charge at each BS, Po. iii) Power needed to retrieve data from the local hard disk when a content from the catalog is requested, Phd. iv) Power needed to retrieve data from the backhaul when a content outside the catalog is requested, Pbh. We assume that Pbh > Phd motivated by the realistic constraint that it is more power consuming to utilize the backhaul connection than to retrieve stored information from the local caching/storage entity. Therefore, the total power consumed at a given BS is sum of all the components such as P (c) tot = P + Po + Pbh Pmiss + Phd Phit = P + Po + Phd + (Pbh Phd)f 1 0 = P + Ps + Pdf 1 0 , (5.10) where Ps = Po + Phd and Pd = Pbh Phd. Without caching In the absence of caching, the BS has to retrieve the requested content from the backhaul every service timeslot. This is equivalent to the case where Phit = 0 (or Pmiss = 1). The total power consumed at a given BS is given as Ptot = P + Po + Pbh = P + Ps + Pd. (5.11) 5.3 Area Power Consumption The power expenditure per unit area, also termed as APC, is an important metric to characterize the deployment and operating costs of BSs, also indicating the compatibility of the system with the legal regulations. In our system model, the APC for cache-enabled BSs is de ned as P(c) = bP (c) tot. (5.12) In the same way, the APC of BSs with no caching capabilities is de ned as P = bPtot. In this section, we aim at minimizing separately the APC for both cases (caching and no caching), while satisfying a certain QoS. This can be formally written as minimize P [0, ) P(P) or P(c)(P) subject to Pcov(P, b) P NN cov . (5.13) Consider rst the case where BSs have caching capabilities. The following result can be obtained for the solution of the optimization problem in (5.13). 49 5.3. Area Power Consumption Proposition 1. Suppose that BSs have caching capabilities, thus P(c)(P) is the objective (utility) function in (5.13). Then, for = 4+ , > 0, the optimal power allocation P that solves (5.13) is lower bounded as P > 2Ps . (5.14) Proof. Using the expression for optimum b from (5.7) and incorporating it in (5.12), we get the expression for APC as P(c) = A P 2 2 (P + Ps + Pdf 1 u A P 2 2 0 ). (5.15) Let be a real number and write = 4 + . P(c) = A P 2 2+ (P + Ps + Pdf 1 u A P 2 2+ 0 ) = A(P 1 2 2+ + PsP 2 2+ + PdP 2 2+ f 1 u A P 2 2+ 0 ). (5.16) For 0, P(c) is a monotonically decreasing function and no minimum point exists. However, for > 0 (i.e. > 4), the rst term in (5.16) dominates as P , indicating that there exists a minimum where the derivative of the curve changes its sign from negative to positive. We set > 0 for what follows. Di erentiating P(c) with respect to P we get d P(c) d P = P +4 +2 f uP 2 +2 A 0 + 2 A(P 2Ps)f uP 2 +2 A 0 2 uf0Pd log(f0)P 2 +2 2Af0Pd. (5.17) Given the fact that P is always positive, the derivative in (5.17) remains negative as P increases from 0 until it is su ciently greater than 2Ps , after which the derivative can change its sign to positive. This indicates that there exists a minimum value for P(c) when P > 2Ps , (5.18) which concludes the proof. For the case where BSs have no caching capabilities, the following result is derived. Proposition 2. Suppose that the BSs have no caching capabilities, thus P(P) is the objective function in (5.13). Then, for = 4 + , > 0, the optimal power allocation P that solves (5.13) is given by P = 2(Ps + Pd) . (5.19) Proof. In the case without caching, by similar treatment as in the proof of Proposition 1, we write the expression for APC as P = A P 2 2+ (P + Ps + Pd). (5.20) It can be noticed that P is a monotonically decreasing function and has no minimum except when > 0 (or > 4). 50 5.3. Area Power Consumption Di erentiating P with respect to P we get d P d P = AP +4 +2 ( 2Pd 2Ps + P ) + 2 . (5.21) By equating the derivative to zero, the optimum power d P d P = 0 P = 2(Ps + Pd) . (5.22) It can easily be veri ed that the second derivative d2 P d P 2 > 0 for P = P . 5.3.1 Remarks For a given nite value of transmit power P, from (5.16) and (5.20), we observe that, in all sensible cases, P(c) < P. (5.23) This indicates that BSs with caching capabilities always outperform those without caching. Additionally, P(c) can be made smaller by increasing the catalog size f0 in BSs. This is indeed intuitively correct, as shown in Fig. 5.2 where some realistic power values from [63] are considered. 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4 4.2 4.4 4.6 f0 = 10 f0 = 100 f0 = 1000 Transmit Power [W] APC [Wm 2] with caching without caching Figure 5.2: APC vs. transmit power with and without caching for values: Ps = 25W, Pd = 10W, = 1, and = 4.75 in (5.15) and (5.20). Fig. 5.3 illustrates the variation of APC with respect to the transmit power in the cases with and without caching, for di erent values of pathloss exponent . It can be noticed that the APC has a 51 5.4. Energy E ciency minimum for a certain power value only when > 4. However, APC can be signi cantly reduced with caching in all cases, and the performance gap between caching and no caching cases is increased for increasing. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 = 4 = 5 = 6 Transmit Power [W] APC [Wm 2] with caching without caching Figure 5.3: APC vs. Transmit power with and without caching for values: Ps = 25W, Pd = 10W, f0 = 10, A = 2 in (5.15) and (5.20) 5.4 Energy E ciency Another key performance metric that should be studied is the energy e ciency, which indicates the amount of utility (throughput) that is extracted out of a unit power invested for network operation. The standard QoS factor chosen as the utility in literature is the Area Spectral E ciency (ASE). In (5.24), we de ne the EE as the ratio between ASE and the total power spent at the BS, i.e. E = b log(1 + )Pcov(P, b) Ptot . (5.24) In order to de ne more precisely the EE metric for both cases, we use the expression for coverage probability established in (5.5). With caching, the expression for EE in (5.24) therefore becomes E(c)(P, b) = b log(1 + )P NN cov (1 A 2 1 b 1 P ) P + Ps + Pdf 1 u b 0 . (5.25) 52 5.5. Concluding remarks In the case without caching, EE is given as E(P, b) = b log(1 + )P NN cov (1 A 2 1 b 1 P ) P + Ps + Pd . (5.26) The following results are given for the maximization of EE and the discussions are carried out afterwards. Proposition 3. Suppose that the BSs have caching capabilities and let P 1 denote the optimal power allocation that maximizes E(c)(P, b). Then P 1 = 1 + r 1 + Ps + Pdf 1 u b 0 . (5.27) Proof. We di erentiate the expression (5.25) with respect to P and solve for the optimum power P 1 d E(c) d P = 0 2P P 2 + Ps + Pdf 1 u b 0 = 0 P 1 = 1 + r 1 + Ps + Pdf 1 u b 0 . (5.28) It can be veri ed that the second derivative d2 E(c) d P 2 is negative for the positive solution of P 1 . Proposition 4. Suppose that the BSs have no caching capabilities and let P 2 denote the optimal power allocation that maximizes E(c)(P, b). Then P 2 = 1 + p 1 + Ps + Pd. (5.29) Proof. Similar to (5.28), we can show that the optimum power P 2 = 1+ 1 + Ps + Pd. It can be veri ed that the second derivative d2 E d P 2 is negative for the positive solution of P 2 . 5.4.1 Remarks Based on the above results, we can make the following observations: 1. For given positive values of b and P, E(c)(P, b) is always higher than E(P, b) making it apparent that implementing BSs with caching capabilities is an energy-e cient solution. 2. For a xed value of b, E(c) has a maximum at P 1 = 1 + q 1 + Ps + Pdf 1 u b 0 and E(P, b) has a maximum at P 2 = 1 + 1 + Ps + Pd. Noting that P 1 < P 2 , we observe that the optimal EE may be attained at a smaller value of transmit power in the case of cache-enabled BSs. In Fig. 5.4 we plot the variation of EE as a function of the transmit power P. It can be seen that EE can be signi cantly increased (in the case of caching) by increasing the size of the catalog in BSs, namely f0. 5.5 Concluding remarks In this chapter, we studied how incorporating caching capabilities at the BSs a ects the energy consump- tion in wireless cellular networks. Adopting a detailed BS power model and modeling the BS locations according to a PPP, we derived expressions for the APC and the EE, which are further simpli ed in the low noise regime. A key observation of this chapter is that cache-enabled BSs can signi cantly decrease the APC and improve the EE as compared to traditional BSs. We also observed that the existence of an optimum power consumption point for the APC depends on the pathloss exponent. 53 5.5.

Recently, there has been an increased focus on the study of energy saving aspects of caching users content at the edge of a heterogeneous cellular networks. For instance, [64] presents an energy e cient power control scheme for a network with energy harvesting SBSs equipped with wireless backhaul and local storage. In [65], a joint caching and base station activation policy for saving energy in a heterogeneous cellular networks has been proposed. In [66], the proposed network design is such that the most popular content is cached at SBSs and an optimized transmission policy at the MBS and the caching policy at the SBS has been proposed in order to minimize the energy consumption in the backhaul link. [67] shows that introducing cache can improve the EE if the le catalog size is not inde nitely large and placing the cached content at the pico BSs is more energy e cient. In this part of the thesis, we explore the energy saving aspects of caching from the point of view of BS densities and transmission powers. Both these are signi cant in terms of deployment as well as maintenance costs. Keeping in view the prospects of improving energy e ciency of a wireless network by incorporating caching end users data at the edge of the network, we propose a system with two tier cellular network - one with caching capabilities and the other without. We model the deployment of these two tiers (one with small base stations and one with macro base stations) according to two independent Poisson point processes. We derive expressions for quantities such as coverage probability of the users and activation probability of base stations, and take these into account while de ning key two system performance metrics, namely the Area Power Consumption (APC) and the Energy E ciency (EE). Imposing some sensible constraints we de ne and solve two problems of optimizing APC and EE with respect to base stations densities and their transmit powers separately. We study how caching a ects these optimization problems and show that it is indeed an energy e cient solution. 55 6.2. Network Model 6.2 Network Model In order to make a performance analysis of a heterogeneous cellular network, we consider the following system model: Topology: In our network model, we have two layers of BSs each randomly deployed according to an independent PPP. In particular, the rst tier is made of SBSs where they are deployed according to a PPP x = {x1, x2 . . .} of intensity x. The second tier is composed of MBSs and are also deployed according to an independent PPP y = {y1, y2 . . .} of intensity y. Additionally, users (mobile terminals) are modelled according to an independent PPP z = {z1, z2 . . .} of intensity z. Without loss of generality, we consider a typical mobile user at Cartesian origin (0, 0) for obtaining the performance metrics of this heterogeneous network. The results derived for typical node apply to any mobile user due to the Slivnyak-Mecke theorem and the stationary and isotropy properties of the PPP [16]. Signal Model: As a worst case scenario, we suppose that small and macro cells operates in the same frequency band, and thus interfere with each other. Each small and macro cell has constant signalling transmit power of Px and Py respectively. For the sake of simplicity, we suppose that a base station (macro or small cell) is represented by its position. The received power experienced at the typical mobile user due to the base station x (or y in case of macro cell) is given by Pxhxg(x), where hx is the fading power coe cient (or square of the fading amplitude) of the channel between the base station x and the typical user, and g(x) = x is the singular path-loss function with > 2 (see [68] for details of this path-loss function). Note that the fading power coe cients are Independent and Identically Distributed (i.i.d.) exponential random variables (namely Rayleigh fading) with mean . Hence, received SINR of the typical user from the signaling base station x is expressed by SINRx = Pxhxg(x) 2 + Ix + Iy (6.1) where Ix = P xi x/x Pxhxig(xi) and Iy = P yj y Pyhyjg(yj) are the cumulative interference experienced from non-signalling small and macro cells respectively, and 2 denotes the power of white additive Gaus- sian noise given as: 2 = W  x + y z  FKT (6.2) where W is the bandwidth, FKT is the noise gure. Finally, the target SINR, that is the minimum SINR that an SBS is expected to provide in order to establish a connection, is denoted by . We impose the constraint that > 1 as this facilitates the analysis by making it more tractable as it makes sure that only one SBS provides an SINR value above the desired threshold[59]. Connectivity Policy: In our network model, we de ne the connectivity policy by which the typical user initiates contact with the network. The user is either connected to a SBS (call event 1) or a MBS (call event 2). In particular, the typical user connects to 1) an SBS that provides the strongest received SINR if it is greater than the threshold , or 2) to the closest MBS if it is within a distance R0 from the given mobile terminal irrespective of how much SINR it provides. Therefore, total coverage probability may be approximately given as the sum of probability of these two events, that is Pcov( x, y, Px, Py) Px + (1 Px)Py = Px(1 Py) + Py (6.3) where Px is the probability of the occurrence of the rst event (namely SBS connection) and Py is the probability of the occurrence of second event (namely MBS connection). It has to be noted at this point that the above two events are not necessarily mutually exclusive and we only adopt an approximate treatment in this work. A more rigorous approach would take into consideration the correlation between these two events. 56 6.2. Network Model 6.2.1 Caching Model Many studies have pointed out that people tend to access the same content very frequently. Take for example some popular TV shows, viral videos with millions of views, news blogs and online streaming. In such conditions, the underlying network has to deliver the same content multiple times which in turn cause high latency and congestion. In cellular networks, we also know that speci c types of content (or information) are highly popular than the others [61], thus it is reasonable to assume a global content popularity distribution which highly matches with users choice distribution. In this context, as alluded to earlier, cache-enabled BSs can exploit this information by storing the popular contents locally, thus yielding higher satisfactions of mobile users and o oading the communication infrastructure of the service provides. Suppose that each BS is assembled with a storage unit (i.e., solid-state-drive or hard disk) in order to cache popular content. Since these storage capacities are bounded in practice, we let each BS to store a set of content up to f0 x (the catalog). Here f0 is a constant representing the total catalog size of SBS deployment, and x is the density of SBS. Instead of caching content uniformly at random, as mentioned before, we focus on storing the most popular content according to the given global popularity statistics. To show this, we assume that the content popularity distribution at a typical user is a right continuous and monotonically decreasing PDF, de ned as [62] fpop (f, ) = ( ( 1) f , f 1, 0, f < 1, (6.4) where f indicates a point in the support of the corresponding content, and characterize the steepness of the content popularity distribution. Lower values of results in almost uniform behaviour, whereas higher values means that more content is sorted toward the left of the distribution, thereby yielding a steeper behaviour. Now, as we know that BSs store the catalog according to the content popularity distribution in (6.4), the cache hit probability becomes paramount of interest and needs be calculated. In our case, the probability that a content demanded by a connected user to be in the cache of BS (within the range [0, f0]), namely cache hit probability, is given by Phit = Z f0 x 0 fpop(f, ) df = Z f0 x 0 ( 1)f df = 1  f0 x 1 . (6.5) It can be shown that Phit converges to 1 as f0 x , namely when the catalog stored in the BSs grows to in nity. As a consequence, the probability that a demanded content is missing from the catalog is written as Pmiss =  f0 x 1 . The sketch of the system model is shown in Fig. 6.1, including realizations of PPPs for small/macro cells and users. In what follows, we present our main results on performance metrics introduce a detailed area power consumption model and an energy e ciency metric with both of them taking into consideration the caching capabilities at BSs as well as other load dependent and independent components of the network. This extensive model will be used to quantify the bene ts of cache-enabled BS deployments from point of energy aspects. 57 6.3.

We start by focusing on coverage probabilities as follows. Lemma 3. In a low noise regime, probability that a typical user is covered by a SBS is given by Px = x  1 P x + Q y R(P x + Q y) ( +2 2 ) ( + 2 2 )  (6.6) where P = 2 2 2F1(1, 2 ;2 2 ; ) ( 2) , Q = 2 2( Px Py ) 2 csc[ 2 ] , R = b 2 Px , and > 2 is a su ciently small number less than 1. Therein, F1(., .; .; .) and (.) are the hyper-geometric and gamma functions respec- tively [69]. On the other hand, in case of no noise regime (R 0), it holds that PNN x = x P x + Q y . (6.7) Proof. See Appendix 6.8. Lemma 4. Probability that a typical user is covered by a macro cell base station is given by Py = 1 e y R2 0. (6.8) Proof. The proof can be easily shown from void probability of PPP [16]. Using Lemmas 3 and 4, the coverage probability under no noise regime can be straightforwardly expressed as follows. Corollary 1. Probability that a typical user is either covered by a small cell or macro cell is approximately given by Pcov( x, y, Px, Py) 1 + xe y R2 0 P x + Q y e y R2 0 (6.9) where P, Q and Q are de ned as in Lemma 3. 58 6.3. Performance Metrics and Quality of Service Now, we are ready to state and prove two results in order to establish the analytical expressions of the activation probabilities of a given SBS and an MBS. Note that the activation probabilities together with coverage probabilities shall be extensively used in our area power consumption and energy e ciency metrics given in the following sections. First, in the following lemma, we de ne the activation probability of an SBS as the probability that it o ers an SINR above the threshold to at least one user and we derive its analytical expression. Lemma 5. The probability that a given SBS is active is given as Pact x 1 + z  1 P x + Q y R(P x + Q y) ( +2 2 ) ( + 2 2 )  (6.10) where P = 2 ( 1 ) 2 csc[ 2 ] , Q and R are de ned as in Lemma 3. On the other hand, in case of no noise regime (R 0), it holds that Pact NN x = z P x + Q y . (6.11) Proof. See Appendix 6.10. In the following lemma, we de ne the activation probability of an MBS as the probability that a typical user is not covered by an SBS and an MBS is at a distance R0 from the considered user. Lemma 6. The probability that a given MBS is providing an SINR above the threshold to at least one user at given instance is approximately given by Pact y (1 x  1 P x + Q y R(P x + Q y) ( +2 2 ) ( + 2 2 )  ) (1 exp( z R2 0)), (6.12) where P, Q and R are de ned as in Lemma 3. Proof. See Appendix 6.11. Having these analytical expressions above, we now focus on the de nition of our main performance metrics that are related to green aspects of caching in cellular networks. 6.3.1 Area Power Consumption The power expenditure per unit area, also coined as APC, is an crucial metric to quantize the deployment and operating costs of BSs, also required for the compatibility of the network with the legal regulations. The total APC is the sum of the power consumed by di erent analog components and digital signal processing units of the BS in a given area. That is to say P = xP x x + yP x y | {z } (i) + xPact x P act x + yPact y P act y | {z } (ii) (6.13) where component (i) captures load-independent area power consumption per unit area, i.e the power consumed per unit area irrespective of weather a BS is serving a user or not. It consists of: 59 6.3. Performance Metrics and Quality of Service P x x : The xed power consumed at each SBS regardless of being active or non-active. We de ne P x x = P o x + Px, where P o x is the maintenance cost of a SBS and Px is the load independent wireless transmission cost. This term in overall accounts for load-independent power consumption required for site-cooling, control signalling, baseband processors and backhaul usage [63]. Power consumption of load-independent caching operation is also incorporated into the term P x x (i.e., regular/periodic estimation of content popularity). P x y : The xed power consumed at each MBS regardless of being active and non-active. We again de ne P x y = P o y + Py, where P o y is the maintenance cost and Py is the load independent wireless transmission cost. The elements that contributes to P x y are similar to the elements mentioned for P x x , except some hardware and software di erences between MBSs and SBSs (i.e., no caching capabilities at the MBSs). Component (ii) in (6.13) accounts for load-dependent area power consumption with Pact x : Probability that a randomly chosen SBS serves at least on user. This quanti es the activity of an SBS, thus representing the amount of load on a given SBS in general. The expressions for Pact x are provided in Lemma 5. P act x : Total power consumed when an SBS is active. This term accounts for the load-dependent power consumed by the circuit components in transceiver chains of each SBS (i.e., ampli ers, converters, mixers and lters). Moreover, the consumed power due to channel estimation via stan- dard linear algebra operations [70], coding and decoding with some suboptimal xed-complexity algorithms [71], operations for linear processing (i.e., Cholesky factorization for Zero Forcing (ZF) processing [70]), backhaul usage in case of cache misses [72] and access to the cache are considered in this term. When caching is incorporated into the network architecture, P act x accounts for the av- erage power consumed at an SBS considering the cases that the desired content is and is not cached in the local hard disk. Therefore, from (6.5), it follow that P act x = Pbh( f0 x )1 + Phd(1 ( f0 x )1 ), where Pbh includes the power needed to retrieve data from the backhaul when a content outside the catalog is requested, and Phd includes the power needed to retrieve data from the local hard disk when a content from the catalog is requested. In the absence of caching, P act x = Pbh. Pact y : Probability that an MBS is active and captures the load of a MBS. The expressions for Pact y are given in Lemma 6. P act y : Total power consumed when an MBS is active. Similar power components as in Pact x are included in P act y with slight di erences in the setup (i.e., no caching capability at the MBS). 6.3.2 Energy E ciency Yet another key performance metric that should be investigated is the energy e ciency, which quantize the amount of utility that is gathered out of a unit power invested for network operation. Some standard QoS factors chosen as the utility in literature are the ASE, throughput and coverage probability [73]. In our case, we de ne EE of the system as the ratio between the average coverage probability o ered by a BS and the power consumed at an average active BS. The expression of EE is given as E = xPx + y(1 Px)Py power consumed at an average active BS = xPx + y(1 Px)Py Pact x P act x + Pact y P act y . (6.14) De nitions of the terms involved hold same as in Section 6.3.1. 60 6.4. Suitable System Optimizations towards Cache-empowered Green Networks 6.4 Suitable System Optimizations towards Cache- empowered Green Networks In order to reduce energy consumption in the considered network model, it is important to optimize right metrics. In this section, we explore the conditions under which APC can be minimized and EE can be maximized when the density x and transmit power Px of SBSs are varied separately. This results in four di erent optimization problems and are elaborated in the subsequent sections. In fact, another important factor while performing optimizations on energy consumption related metrics is to have a right set of justi able constraints which can reduce the overall cost of network deployment. These constraints are given as follows. C1: The constraint Px Py kp; 0 < kp < 1 xes the the ratio between the transmit powers of SBSs and MBSs to be always less than kp. C2: The constraint y x kyx; 0 < kyx < 1 xes the ratio between the number of MBSs and SBSs to be always less than kyx in a given patch of area. kyx here indicates the constraint on the infra structural costs. C3: The constraint z x kzx; kzx > 1 xes the ratio between the number of users and number of SBSs to be always greater than kzx in a given patch of area. Typically we keep this as one SBS per every 10 15 users. C4: The constraint Px PNN x makes sure that the coverage probability an SBS is always positive and is always greater that the coverage probability o ered during a no noise regime by a factor such that 0 < < 1. C5: The constraint Pact x Pact NN x makes sure that the activation probability of an SBS is always positive and is always greater that the activation probability during a no noise regime by a factor such that 0 < < 1. The following result holds for optimal minimum SBS transmit power. Proposition 5. Minimum SBS transmit power (P min x ) for the constraint Px PNN x to be satis ed is given as P min x = max{A1,A2} 2 x , where, A1 = 2 ( +2 2 ) (1 )(P +Qkyx) 2 and A2 = 2 ( +2 2 ) (1 )(P +Qkyx) 2 . Proof. See Appendix 6.9. Conversely, it follows from the above proposition that the minimum SBS density at which the con- straint on coverage probability is satis ed is given as min x = max{A 2 1 , A 2 2 } P 2 x . (6.15) Now, we focus on aforementioned four optimization problems which we have bounds and observations for optimal values of x and Px. 6.4.1 Optimization of APC with respect to x In this section, we formulate the problem of optimizing APC (P) with respect to the SBS density x 61 6.5.

Proof. See Appendix 6.14. 6.4.4 Optimizing energy e ciency with repect to Px Proposition 6. The expression for EE as a function of Px is monotonically decreasing. Proof. See Appendix 6.15. 6.5 Numerical Results and Validation In this section, we present numerical results to con rm our theoretical expressions. We also discuss the behavior of various quantities of interest and compare them with our theoretical conclusions. Fig 6.2 illustrates the variation of the SBS coverage probability Px with respect to the SBS density x. It can be noticed the coverage probability asymptotically attains a constant value as x just as expected from Eq (6.28). 62 6.5.

The dotted curves represent theoretical values and the continuous lines represent values form numerical simulations. Fig 6.3 illustrates the variation of the SBS coverage probability Px with respect to the SBS transmit power Px. It can be noticed the coverage probability asymptotically attains a constant value as Px just as expected from Eq (6.28). Fig 6.4 illustrates the variation of the SBS activation probability Pact x with respect to the SBS density x. It can be noticed the activation probability asymptotically attains a constant value as x just as expected from Eq (6.28). Fig 6.5 illustrates the variation of the SBS activation probability Pact x with respect to the SBS transmit power Px. When there are very few SBSs, the optimal power that satis es the constraints is seen to be high. Fig 6.6 illustrates the variation of the optimal SBS transmit power P min x that satis es the constraints C1-5. When the SBS transmit power is very low, the optimal SBS density that satis es the constraints is seen to be high. Fig 6.7 illustrates the variation of the optimal SBS density min x that satis es the constraints C1-5. When the SBS density is very low, the optimal SBS transmit power that satis es the constraints is seen to be high. Fig 6.8 illustrates the variation of APC with respect to the SBS density x. It can be noticed that APC is a convex function and assumes its lowest value at optimum x. Fig 6.9 illustrates the variation of APC with respect to the SBS transmit power Px.

Fig 6.10 illustrates the variation of EE with respect to the SBS density x. It can be noticed that EE is a concave function and assumes its highest value at optimum x. Fig 6.11 illustrates the variation of EE with respect to the SBS density Px. It can be noticed that EE is a decreasing function of P x. Therefore, as far as transmit power is considered we can conclude that the lower the better. 6.6 Conclusions 1. Choosing to work with a two tier heterogeneous system, one MBSs (without caching abilities) and one SBSs (with caching abilities), we de ned several important system parameters and derived their expressions. 2. APC and EE are two sensible metrics to optimize in order to minimize energy consumption in a network. Taking x and Px (SBS density and transmit power respectively) to be the variables, we had four independent optimization problems to perform. 3. Imposing the constraints C1-5, we found out that APC is a convex function in both x and Px. Although the equations involved are complicated to nd out the exact analytical expressions for 64 6.7.

For a given system values, though, an optimum can be found out using numerical methods. 4. Imposing the constraints C1-5, we found out that EE is a concave function with respect to x and a monotonically decreasing function with respect to Px. We found out the upper limit for optimal x for which EE takes the peak value. 5. In future work, it may be of interest to compare the two optimum values of x - one that minimizes the APC and one that maximizes the EE, and verify which of the two metrics is more bene cial economically and in terms of energy consumption. 6. The choice of working with two tiers (macro and small) is arbitrary and this treatment can be generalized to a system with multiple tiers each with a di erent kind of caching capability. 6.7 Appendices 6.8 Proof of Lemma 3 We de ne Px as the probability that the best received SINR from the small BSs is greater than a threshold .

Proof of Proposition 6 6.15 Proof of Proposition 6 We write the expression for energy e ciency, de ned in Eq (6.14), in terms of Px. The numerator in the expression for E(Px) becomes xPx + y(1 Px)Py = x P + Qkyx + kyx x  1 P + Qkyx  (1 e kyx x R2 0) = r x + s x(1 e g x), = ( A Px ) 2 (r + s(1 e g( A Px ) 2 )), (6.59) where r = P +Qkyx , s = kyx  1 P +Qkyx  and g = kyx R2 0. Using Eq (6.54), denominator in the expression for E(Px) in Eq (6.14) Pact x P act x + Pact y P act y = " kzx 1 P + Qkyx (1 ) (P + Qkyx) 2 (P + Qkyx) +2 2 !# (Phd + Pdf 1 0 A 2( 1) P 2(1 ) x ) +  (1 e kzx( A Px ) 2 R2 0)  1 P + Qkyx  Pbh (6.60) Substituting the numerator and denominator from Eq (6.59) and Eq (6.60) in Eq (6.14), it can be observed that the function E(Px) is monotonically decreasing with Px. By which we deduce that there is no optimum value for EE with respect to SBS transmit power Px. In this case, one can choose the least Px possible and x the value of x to x in Eq (6.58). 78 Part III Conclusions 79 Chapter 7 Conclusions and future directions This thesis presented solutions to the problem of bettering energy e ciency in wireless networks. Clearly the range of possible approaches to this problem is huge and this thesis focused mainly on the fundamentals of physics in the rst part and on the system level design issues in the second part. 7.1 Fundamental limits In the rst part of this thesis, we devised a thought-experiment like communication system and calculated the upper bound on its energy e ciency using thermodynamics and electromagnetic theory. With the help of the proposed model, we have seen that for a given total amount of energy that is available to prepare, transmit, and rewrite information bits, there exists a unique transmitting antenna frequency that yields maximum energy e ciency. We have also seen the dependence of energy e ciency on the bandwidth and the amplitude of the signal, and that it has an optimum at suitable values for the two. We have made a comparison of these dependencies in the cases of binary phase key shifting model and quadrature phase key shifting model. Our results show that, contrary to the results from [28], when the communication system is working at a non-zero temperature, the optimal power consumed by the system in order to maximize energy e ciency is non-zero. 7.1.1 Future directions The treatment can be extended and applied on various choices of physical systems to store and transport information. Our choice of thermodynamic Szilard boxes and electromagnetic waves is in the interest of exploring the limits in the realm of classical physics. However, when we consider very low energy systems, the quantum mechanical e ects could be more pronounced and this requires further study. In future work it may be interesting to explore further fundamental physical systems to represent bits. For example: quantum spin states of particles, quantum mechanically described thermodynamic systems [29]. Also it is very important to study the limits on energy e ciency of a computation device from this line of approach. Studies such as [30] where limits on the energy costs of computation are explored are of great importance in the current era where untethered battery driven mobile computing is ubiquitous. Such enquiries on EE limits of computation shall lead us acquire insights into the limits even at the MAC layer of a communication system. 81 7.2. Stochastic geometry based modeling 7.2 Stochastic geometry based modeling In chapter 4, we addressed optimization of APC in single-tier wireless cellular networks in which the locations of BSs are modeled to have been distributed according to a homogeneous PPP. Under strongest BS association policy, we derived bounds on the optimal transmit power in order to guarantee a certain minimum coverage and data rate. Under the same QoS constraints, we derived the closed form expression for optimal BS density that minimizes the APC. From these results it is seen that the existence of such optimal BS density depends on the value of the pathloss exponent. 7.2.1 Future directions In [31], the authors explored the convexity of the coverage probability function for general unbounded pathloss model. This analysis could be carried forward towards optimization of APC and such metrics. Modeling BS deployments according a uniform PPP is a slightly idealistic generalization. In real scenarios, BSs may be seen deployed densely at one place and relatively rarely in other places. Taking this sort of clustering of varied densities at varied spatial locations and carrying out the EE optimizations is an interesting problem. Backhaul (length of the optical ber etc) costs may also be incorporated into the system model and studied how this is going to a ect the optimal system parameters such as BS density etc. 7.3 Caching in single tier cellular networks In Chapter 5, we studied how incorporating caching capabilities at the BSs in uences the energy consump- tion in wireless cellular networks. Adopting a detailed BS power model and modeling the BS locations according to a PPP, we derived expressions for the APC and the EE, which are further simpli ed in the low noise regime. A key observation of this work is that cache-enabled BSs can signi cantly decrease the APC and improve the EE as compared to traditional BSs. We also observed that the existence of an optimum power consumption point for the APC depends on the pathloss exponent. 7.3.1 Future directions The energy aspects and implications of caching in wireless cellular networks, especially for 5G systems, are of practical and timely interest and clearly require further investigation. Future work may include heterogeneous network scenarios, including small cells, macro cells and WiFi access points deployment. Furthermore, storing the popular content requires accurate estimation of content popularity distribution, which cannot be easily performed in practice and may cost energy in terms of processing power. Therefore, rather than relying on this approach, randomized caching policies in a stochastic scenario [32] can be considered as a means to provide crisp insights on the energy e ciency bene ts of caching in dense wireless networks. Also, popularity distribution may be considered a function of spatial location as it is sensible to assume that what is popular at one place may not be popular elsewhere. In light of this, it makes sense to take the whole process of caching at a great detail in order to make a rigorous comment on whether caching is an energy e cient solution or not. [33], investigates the problem of optimal cache placement at the wireless edge to minimize the backhaul rate in heterogeneous networks. 82 7.4. Caching in two-tier cellular networks 7.4 Caching in two-tier cellular networks In Chapter 6 we proposed a two tier heterogeneous system, one MBSs (without caching abilities) and one SBSs (with caching abilities), we de ned several important system parameters and derived their expressions. We choose APC and EE as two sensible metrics to optimize in order to minimize energy consumption in a network. Taking x and Px (SBS density and transmit power respectively) to be the variables, we had four independent optimization problems to perform. We imposed the constraints C1-5 and found out that APC is a convex function in both x and Px. Since the equations involved are complicated to nd out the exact analytical expressions for the optimal values, we nd out the intervals within which the optima can be found. For a given system values, though, an optimum can be found out using numerical methods. Imposing the constraints C1-5, we found out that EE is a concave function with respect to x and a monotonically decreasing function with respect to Px. We found out the upper limit for optimal x for which EE takes the peak value. 7.4.1 Future directions In future works, it may be of interest to compare the two optimum values of SBS density - the one that minimizes the APC and the one that maximizes the EE, and verify which of the two metrics is relatively more bene cial economically and in terms of energy consumption. The choice of working with two tiers (macro and small) has been arbitrary and this treatment can be generalized to a system with multiple tiers (as in [34]) each with a di erent kind of caching capability. Taking energy consumption at each step of the process of caching users content at the SBSs into account, gives us a more comprehensive hold on factors in uencing energy e ciency and thereby letting us optimize it sensibly. 83 7.4.
