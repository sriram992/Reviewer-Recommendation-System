Digital Education Challenges and Opportunities Abstract : Online education is existing since 2014 but it becomes the only mode of instruction in 2020 due to the Covid pandemic. The whole world faces a lot of challenges, especially in developing countries. It is because in developing countries technology is confined to metropolitan cities only. A major portion of these countries are still rural and cannot provide the necessary infrastructure for digital education. Even after these challenges, it brings manifold opportunities too. This paper will study the opportunities and challenges faced while providing education in Online Mode from the perspective of s t u d e n t s , t e a c h e r s , a n d e d u c a t i o n Institutes/Universities.

Introduction Online Education is internet-based education that relies on the internet and other electronic instruments (Computer, Mobile, Tab, Radio, TV, etc.) for interaction and communication between the teacher and students. It can also be termed e-learning, computer-based education, web-based learning, distance education, etc. Online education was initially conceptualized in asynchronous mode from Boston in 1728 through weekly letters. In 1922 the courses are broadcasted on radio as World War one opened opportunities for broadcasting. In 1953, television was used as the medium of education at the University of Houston. The origination of the internet and the World Wide Web opens up new prospects for universities and educational institutes for online education. In 1996 duke University started its first executive MBA program globally. In 2008 first MOOC (Massive Online Open Course) [1]was created and in 2012 Coursera, Udacity, and edX were also launched. The government of India has also taken many initiatives under the digital-India campaign to promote digital education. These are SWAYAM (Study Webs of Active Learning for Young Aspiring Minds), DIKSHA, e-PG Pathshaala, Swayam Prabha, National Digital Library of India (NDLI), E-Shod Sindhu, National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL), Virtual Labs, etc. Journal of Engineering Education Transformations , Volume 35 , No. 4 , April 2022 , ISSN 2349-2473, eISSN 2394-1707 Geeta Rani , Puninder Kaur , Taruna Sharma 1 2 3 1geeta@chitkara.edu.in puninder.k@chitkara.edu.in 2 taruna.sharma@chitkara.edu.in 3 Geeta Rani geeta@chitkara.edu.in Technology is growing exponentially in the 21st century which influenced almost every sector. As per the Economic Times report, the number of internet users will increase by 40% and Smartphone users will be doubled by 2023. Universities are offering one of the courses through the digital domain only. They provide interactive learning models to attract learners. Institutes are gradually introducing digital practices. They have updated their curriculum to introduce new technologies so that they can deal with modern businesses [2]. Universities and Educational Institutes are shifting from traditional teaching to new age methodologies which are using the current technologies like IOT, Clouds, robotics, nanotechnology, etc. Moreover, many start-ups are coming forward to this sector which further changed the emplacement dynamics too.

This is required for better personal and professional development. This opportunity is not there in online classes. In nursing/medical education [4] where it is required to have good communication between the staff and patients, Social interaction becomes a mandatory requirement. 5. Self-management of Students: In online education there is no direct control of teachers on students so they need to be self-motivated and self-disciplined [6,8]. Parents also pay an essential role to make them self disciplined. Moreover proper environment need to be provided during online education so that they can focus on studies. 6. Time: As teachers need to restructure their lectures [4-5] and there is no standard e-content available for online lectures. They need more time to prepare the lecture and materials. So proper preplanning is required. 7. Evaluation and credibility of degrees: In online education, it becomes a challenge to evaluate [5]the students as teachers or Educational Institutes have no direct control over them especially in the scenario of Covid -19. Moreover, there are more chances of fake degrees online so it becomes a question on the credibility of degrees [6]. 8. Language Barrier [6, 8]: Online courses can be taught worldwide as well they can reach up to rural areas. But in that case, language becomes an issue if the course is published in a single language 3. Challenges In Digital Education Diverse researches have been reviewed and it has been found most students and teachers faced the same kind of challenges. 1. Internet connection: Major challenge faced by both students and teachers is slow and exorbitant internet connection [3,5,7] which is the backbone of online education. It has been especially faced in non-urban areas of developing countries which results in longer waiting times and ultimately increases student's frustration and confusion. 2. Lack of Infrastructure: There is overloading of servers [2] and deficiency of other necessary infrastructure [3-8] due to premature shift to online education due to covid-19. Moreover, most of the stu dents canno t afford to purchase a desktop/laptop which is a requirement especially for practical/programming subjects for effective online education. 3. Unfamiliar Technology [7] and resistance to change: All the students and teachers are not aware of latest technology. Moreover, technology is changing day by day. Furthermore, there is resistance to change from traditional teaching to online teaching/learning 4. Less Social Interaction [3-6]: Learners have a low level of engagement and interest due to the passive nature of the online lecture. In traditional classrooms, the participants have the opportunity to collaborate, communicate with each other. They can share experiences, problems, support, and 125 Journal of Engineering Education Transformations , Volume 35 , No. , April 2022 , ISSN 2349-2473, eISSN 2394-1707 4 4. Opportunities In Digital Education Despite of above mentioned challenges the whole world is adopting digital education. This is because of its opportunities i.e. flexibility in learning, cost effectiveness, global exposure, better skills and employability. 1. The flexibility of learning [5,6]: As online education is accessed from the Web, so it is accessible anytime and everywhere where the internet is available. Students need not to travel from long distance to study a course. Moreover, the students who r working or having other liabilities have the opportunity to continue their studies. 2. Cost-effective: Online education is cost-effective [5, 9] because students do not have to pay hostel as well as transport charges. Moreover, there is a lot of free E-content available on the Web. The government is also facilitating for the same so that education can be reached, everyone. 3. Improved skill and confidence [8,10]: There are numerous standardized courses available online and taught by knowledgeable and well-known educators. Now everyone has access to them which was not there in the case of traditional education. 4. Better Employability [5]: Online education act as a medium to bridge the gap between candidates and respective employers. There is an abundance of courses available on advanced technologies in almost every domain i.e. cloud, IoT, Big Data, Software testing, Hospitality, Nursing, Coding, and many more. Students can maintain their skills as per industry expectations. 5. Global Exposure [5]: Many reputed and prestigious institutions all over the world were earlier out of reach. It is because of their admission procedure and unaffordable nature. Now they are offering online courses which are reachable as well as accepted by employers 6. Blended Model [6]: Now a day's blended Model is becoming popular in which students can take benefit from Online learning as well as traditional teaching. Both student and teacher need to be present and online teaching methodologies are blended into traditional methods. 7. Better impact on Health: As teachers and students need not to interact physically so there is no harm from infectious disease. In this way online teaching protects the society from these kinds of diseases. 8. More Productive classes: In traditional classrooms teachers spend most of the classroom time in controlling students. Now in digital learning they can concentrate more on teaching. 5. Recommendations And Conclusion As seen from the literature, online teaching cannot replace traditional teaching because cannot ignore the its importance of traditional teaching for development of physical and mental health. Even after the challenges, online education is becoming popular day by day due to the opportunities it is providing to society and it's a need of the hour too. In the case of the pandemic situation, this is the only solution when we cannot compromise the health of students and teachers. But to improve its effectiveness we have overcome most of the challenges discussed in section III. For this we all students, teachers, educational Fig. 1 : Challenges in Digital Education Fig. 2 : Opportunities in Digital Education 126 Journal of Engineering Education Transformations , Volume 35 , No. , 2022 , ISSN 2349-2473, eISSN 2394-1707 4 April Institutes, Universities, Industries, and Govt. policymakers have to join our hands and work together to overcome these challenges. First and foremost, necessary infrastructure [2,3,8] must be provided because a good Internet speed, necessary equipment is the spine of online education. These online courses must be planned [2,13] well in advance and the curriculum and schedule must be changed accordingly so that teachers can provide quality education. All the necessary support and assistance [12,13] need to be provided to students, teachers, and staff members to overcome the fear of technology. Regular workshops and webinars need to be arranged to provide the necessary knowledge and support. Teachers should be prepared and motivated has to opt for effective online teaching methodologies [2, 12, 13] i.e., they need to take care of voice modulation as voice is the only media in online lectures. They need to engage every student. An effective evaluation system [12,13] needs to be opted to access the effort of every student efficiently. Online participation should be graded so that every student can be engaged An effective feedback system [11] must be opted to measure student satisfaction. Synchronous online teaching must be opted so that students can participate and express themselves. New methodologies [2] i.e virtual reality, augmented reality, simulations, gaming should be used to create the interest of students. Courses need to be published in different languages [6] to broaden their reach. References [1] Kaplan, A.M. and Haenlein, M., 2016.
