Introduction Nowadays, the electrical power market becomes highly com- petitive and more liberal for increasing energy demand. Economic load dispatch (ELD) is one of the useful tools in the modern energy management system of operation and planning. ELD plays a vital role in maintaining the economy of the power system. Reduction of the production cost and growth in the system reliability maxi- mize the energy capability of thermal units through a good load dispatch. The main goal of ELD process is to schedule the power system control variables for sharing the total load to achieve high- est economy of operation while satisfying all equality and inequal- ity constraints. To achieve optimal solution of a practical ELD problem, the realistic operation of the ELD problem should con- sider valve point effects, ramp rate and multiple fuels. Several derivative based approaches such as the classical optimization methods based on Lagrangian relaxation [1], quadratic program- ming (QP) [2], branch and bound method [3], lambda iteration method (LIM) [4], gradient method [5], linear programming (LP) [6], co-ordination equation [7], dynamic programming (DP) [8] assuming monotonically increasing piecewise linear cost function, have successfully been applied to solve ELD. However, the classical optimization techniques are highly sensitive to staring points and often converge to local optimum or diverge altogether. Solutions of ELD problem applying DP may cause the dimensions extremely large, which requires enormous computational efforts. Due to the presence of nonlinear characteristics such as ramp rate limits, dis- continuous prohibited operating zones and non-smooth cost func- tions of practical ELD problem, these methods are infeasible in practical systems and are unable to locate the global optima solu- tion. To solve non smooth and non convex ELD problem, Yang et al. [9] presented an analytical method named quadratically con- strained programming (QCP). Due to a large number of constraints and highly nonlinear characteristics of the ELD problem, the classi- cal calculus based methods cannot perform satisfactorily and are trapped to local optimum. Hence, it becomes essential to overcome these drawbacks and handle such dif culties through developing a robust, improved and reliable technique. In the recent years, com- plex constrained optimization problems are solved by many arti - cial intelligent methods such as Hop eld neural network (HNN) [10,11] and adaptive HNN [12]. These techniques have successfully been applied in recent years to solve non-convex, non-smooth and non-differentiable ELD problems. However, due to excessive numerical iterations of these methods, more reliable and fast methods are needed. With the development of computer technology, the population based modern intelligent heuristic and stochastic optimization methods such as evolutionary programming (EP) [13], hybrid evo- lutionary programming (HEP) [14], differential evolution (DE) [15], genetic algorithm (GA) [16], adaptive real coded GA (ARCGA) [17], http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijepes.2016.04.034 0142-0615/ 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

In the year of 2009, the gravitational search algorithm (GSA), a heuristic algorithm based on the Newtonian laws of gravity and motion, was devel- oped by Rashedi et al. [38]. Af julla et al. solved ELD problems by implementing GSA [39]. Roy et al. implemented GSA [40] to solve unit commitment problem for superior features including stable convergence characteristic and avoids premature conver- gence. A teaching learning based optimization (TLBO) was intro- duced to solve combined heat and power dispatch problem [41]. Very recently, quasi oppositional TLBO (QOTLBO) [42] technique which employed opposition based learning for TLBO initialization and generation jumping was proposed by Roy et al. An opposition based harmony search algorithm (OHSA) was introduced by Chat- terjee et al. [43], where opposite numbers were utilized to improve the convergence rate of harmony search algorithm (HSA). Krill herd algorithm (KHA), rst proposed by Gandomi and Alavi [44], was successfully applied to solve ELD problems [45]. Dutta et al. in their recent endeavour proposed hybrid chemical reaction optimization (HCRO) algorithm to explore the entire search space for solutions [46]. Recently, Barisal and Prusty [47] proposed invasive weed opti- mization (IWO) to solve ELD problem of large scale power system. Oppositional real coded chemical reaction optimization approach [48] has been extensively used in electrical power systems due to their ability to mould nonlinearity and uncertainty in practical problems. Shanhe et al. [49] in their recent endeavour imple- mented hybrid PSO/GSA approach to solve non-linearity based ELD problem. A new ef cient optimization technique was pro- posed by Chen et al. [50] to solve wind based ELD problem of a multi-area power system. Bulbul et al. [51] introduced opposi- tional KHA approach to successfully solve ELD problem of small, medium and large scale power systems. However, some of these heuristic methods may have poor per- formance on different set of problems. Some algorithms perform local exploitation at the mature stage of the search and global exploratory search at the early stages of the evolutionary process. Few of the aforementioned methods have excellent global search capabilities but, they have some limitations in their local search ability. Some of the techniques discussed above face premature convergence. To overcome premature convergence and speed up the search process a more powerful method is needed. In this research work, a newly developed meta heuristic algorithm, named grey wolf optimization (GWO) [52], which does not have any af nity to stick in local optimum points in the com- plex multimodal optimization problem and which provides a more diverse search of the solution space is proposed to solve complex ELD problems. The GWO is based on behaviour of grey wolf [53]. The better optimum solutions with lower computation burden can be found in GWO compared to the existing stochastic search techniques mentioned above. The GWO is superior to these meth- ods because (i) The GWO has better conveying mechanism and information sharing capability; (ii) it uses random function and considers three candidate solutions for getting better results and converges quickly by making jump from local minima towards glo- bal minima. To justify the effectiveness of the proposed method, the pro- posed GWO approach is applied to solve different test systems with valve point effects, ramp rate limits, prohibited operating regions, multiple fuels, etc. The performance of the solution results are compared with those of the existing methods available in the literature. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: ELD problem is formulated in Section Problem formulation . In Section Grey wolf optimization algorithm , the original GWO algorithm is brie y described. GWO applied to ELD problem is explained in Section Gray wolf optimization applied to ELD . The system simu- lation and results are provided in Section Case studies and numer- ical results . Section Conclusion outlines the, conclusions followed by reference. Problem formulation The ELD is one of the important optimization strategies for management of the power system. The following objective and constraints are taken into account in the formulation of ELD problem. Objective function The objective of ELD is to minimize the total fuel cost while sat- isfying all equality and inequality constraints. The various cost functions used in ELD problem are as follows. Nomenclature Ft total fuel cost Pgi power generation of the ith generating unit Fi Pgi fuel cost function for power generation of the ith unit n number of generating units in the thermal power plant P population size I number of iterations lb lower boundary of search area ub upper boundary of search area ai; bi; ci; ei; f i fuel cost coef cients of the ith generating unit aik; bik; cik; eik; f ik the Kth type of fuel cost coef cients of the ith generating unit Pgmin i minimum amount of power generation of the ith unit Pgmax i maximum amount of power generation the ith unit PD the total load demand Bij; Bi0; B00 loss coef cients of the line connected between the ith and the jth bus PL the transmission network losses URRi; DRRi up rate and down rate limit of the ith generating unit ni the number of prohibited zones of the ith generating unit Pgi0 previous operating zone of the ith generating unit np population size 326 M. Pradhan et al. / Electrical Power and Energy Systems 83 (2016) 325 334 Quadratic cost function The optimization of the ELD problem is formulated mainly in terms of the fuel cost function expressed as the sum of a quadratic function. This function is written as: X n i 1 Fi Pgi X n i 1 ai Pgi 2 bi Pgi ci h i i 1; 2; . . . ; n 1 Cost function with valve point effect A rippling effect is produced for the steam admission through the valve in turbine, so it is more practical for considering the valve point effect with the fuel cost function to incorporate exible oper- ational facilities. The fuel cost in terms of real power output, may be expressed as the sum of a quadratic and a sinusoidal function in the following form: Ft X n i 1 Fi Pgi X n i 1 ai Pgi 2 bi Pgi ci ei  sin f i  Pgmin i  Pgi       h i 2 Multiple fuel cost functions Moreover, thermal generating units may supply multiple types of fuel from different fuel sources. Each dispatching unit operates on multiple fuel sources depending upon the load and suitability of power generation. The objective is to nd a suitable fuel for each generating unit in order to minimize the total fuel cost while sat- isfying different constraints including power balance and genera- tion limits. Both multiple fuel options and valve point effects should be considered to obtain a realistic and more accurate ELD solution that is mathematically represented in (3) is given below. Constraints Generation capacity constraints The active power generation of each thermal power unit must be less than or equal to the maximum power permitted and also be greater than or equal to the minimum power permitted on that speci ed unit and it may mathematically be expressed as: Pgmin i 6 Pgi 6 Pgmax i 4 Power balance constraints The total power generation by the thermal units must be equal to the total power demanded by the load and the total transmis- sion loss. Thus, the equality constraint may be mathematically for- mulated as: X n i 1 Pgi PD PL 5 The transmission loss of the system is calculated using power ow coef cients by the Kron s loss formula or the B coef cient formula: PL X n i 1 X n j 1 PgiBijPgj X n i 1 Bi0Pgi B00 6 Prohibited operating zone The generating units might have prohibited operating zone(s) in the input output curve of generator due to presence of physical operation such as vibration in its shift bearing, some faults in the generating units or their accessories, like boiler and feed pumps. Each generating unit must avoid operation in those prohibited zones. In practical operation, the feasible operating zone of the ith unit can be expressed as follows: Pgmin i 6 Pgi 6 Pgi;1 Pgi;j1 6 Pgi 6 Pgi;j Pgi;ni 6 Pgi 6 Pgmax i 8 > > < > > : j 2; 3; . . . ni  1 7 Ramp rate constraints For successful operation, the operating range of each generat- ing unit is restricted by its ramp rate limits by imposing the units to operate repeatedly between two adjacent speci c oper- ation zones. The power output Pgi, by the ith generator in cer- tain interval may not exceed that of previous interval Pgi0 by more than a certain amount URRi, the up ramp rate limit and neither may it be less than that of the previous interval by more than the amount DRRi, the down ramp rate limit of the ith gen- erator. This constraint may mathematically be expressed as follows: max Pgmin i ; Pgi0  DRRi   6 Pgi 6 min Pgmax i ; Pgi0  URRi   8 Grey wolf optimization algorithm Grey wolf optimization (GWO) is a new population based meta- heuristic algorithm proposed by Mirjalili et al. in 2014 [52]. The method imitates the hunting behaviour and social hierarchy of grey wolves. The leadership hierarchy in GWO algorithm [52,53] is de ned as alpha, beta, delta and omega. The problem is to de ne the cost ef cient level of habitat protection that satis es a feasibil- ity constraint for a sensitive wildlife population. The viability con- straint requires a high probability of attaining a population size target. The alpha, beta, and delta estimate the victim position and update their positions randomly around the victim. The nal position would be in a position within a circle which is de ned by the positions of alpha, beta, and delta in the search space. On the basis of behaviour of grey wolves, GWO is implemented where a speci c number of grey wolves in a pack moves through a multi dimensional search space to look for prey. In this optimiza- tion algorithm, the positions of grey wolves are considered as dif- ferent position variables and the distances of the prey from the grey wolves determine the tness value of the objective function. In GWO, the individual grey wolf adjusts its position and moves to the better position. The GWO saves the best solutions obtained Fi Pgi ai1 Pgi 2 bi1 Pgi ci1 ei1  sin f i1  Pgmin i  Pgi       if Pgmin i 6 Pgi 6 Pgi1 aik Pgi 2 bi2 Pgi ci2 ei2  sin f i2  Pgi2  Pgi j j if Pgi1 6 Pgi 6 Pgi2 aik Pgi 2 bik Pgi cik eik  sin f ik  Pgik  Pgi j j if Pgik 6 Pgi 6 Pgmax i 8 > > < > > : 3 M. Pradhan et al. / Electrical Power and Energy Systems 83 (2016) 325 334 327 through the course of iterations. The goal of this algorithm is to reach to the prey by the shortest possible route. The movement of each individual is in uenced by four processes, namely (i) Searching for prey (exploration) (ii) Encircling prey (iii) Hunting (iv) Attacking prey (exploitation) These operators are brie y explained and mathematically expressed in the following subsection. Searching for prey (exploration) The grey wolves diverge from each other position for searching a victim. Make use of A~ M with random values to compel the search agent to diverge from the victim. The component C ~ M provides ran- dom weights for searching prey in the search space. Hence explo- ration through A~ M and C ~ M permits this algorithm to globally search the area. C ~ M vector also presents the effect of obstacles to impending the prey. Encircling prey The alpha, beta and delta estimate the position of the three best wolves and other wolves updates their positions using the posi- tions of these three best wolves. Encircling behaviour can be repre- sented by D~ M. The expected boundary is mathematically represented by the following equations: D~ M C ~ M  X~P t  ~X t   9 ~X t 1 X~P t  A~ M  D~ M 10 Here t indicates the current iteration, A~ M and C ~ M are coef cient vectors, X~P t is the position vector of prey, ~X t represents the posi- tion vector of a grey wolf. r~1 and r~2 are random vectors in [0,1]. ~a is linearly decreased from 2 to 0. A~ M 2 ~a  r~1 ~a 11 C ~ M 2  r~2 12 Hunting Conservation of regional habitat connectivity has the potential to facilitate recovery of the grey wolf. After encircling, alpha wolf guides for hunting. Later, the delta and beta wolves join in hunting. It is tough to predict about the optimum location of prey. The hunt- ing behaviour of grey wolf, based on the position of alpha, beta, gamma (candidate solution) wolf can be represented by DMa !

X! a1 X! b1 X! d1 3 19 Attacking prey (exploitation) The grey wolves stop the hunting by attacking the prey when it stop moving. It depends on the value of ~a. A~ M is a random value in the interval [2a,2a]. In GWO, search agents update their positions based on the location of alpha, beta, delta wolves mentioned in hunting phase and attack towards the prey. The GWO algorithm can be summarized as follows: Step 1: Number of grey wolves or search agents is considered as population size. Step 2: Initialize the position vectors of search agents for search- ing and encircling the prey in upper and lower boundary area of grey wolves. Maximum number of iterations is also initialized. Step 3: Evaluate the tness values of individual solution. Each tness value represents the distance of the prey from the indi- vidual wolf. Based on the tness value, three best wolves are identi ed as a; b and d categories of wolves. To achieve the prey, the hunting behaviour of various categories of grey wolf are modi ed using (13) (15). Step 4: Update the position of search agents using (16) (20). Step 5: Repeat steps 3 4 until they reach to the prey. Step 6: The termination is done when a speci ed number of iter- ations are met. Grey wolf optimization applied to ELD The different steps of GWO algorithm for solving ELD problems are described below. Step 1: Active power generation of all the generating units except the last unit is initialized randomly within their lower and upper real power operating limits, i.e., each component must satisfy generator capacity constraints. The quantity of active power generation of the last unit is evaluated using (5) and tested whether it grati es the inequality constraint or not. The infeasible solutions are reinitialized. Numerous initial solution sets are generated depending upon the population size. The position of different search agents (grey wolves) are repre- sented through reasonable solution set (control variables). Depending upon the initial search agents (grey wolves) position matrix is created as given below: P P1 g1; P1 g2 ; . . . ; P1 gi . . . ; P1 gn P2 g1; P2 g2 ; . . . ; P2 gi . . . ; P2 gn . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

P np g1; P np g2 ; . . . ; P np gi . . . ; Pnp gn 2 6666666664 3 7777777775 20 Step 2: Evaluate tness of each solution of current population using (1) (3). Each tness value represents the distance of the individual wolf from the prey. Step 3: Sort the population from best to worst. The best, second best and third best solutions respectively, represent the posi- tions of a, b and d categories of wolves. 328 M. Pradhan et al. / Electrical Power and Energy Systems 83 (2016) 325 334 Step 4: Modify the position of each search agents using the searching prey, encircling prey, hunting and attacking prey con- cepts. The position of each search agent represents a potential solution comprised of active power generation of ELD problem. Step 5: Check whether the operating limits of the active power of all generating units except last unit are violated or not. If any power generation is less than the minimum level, it is made equal to minimum value. Similarly, if it is greater than the max- imum level, it is assigned its maximum value. Subsequently, last unit of the power generation is evaluated using (5) and whether it satis es all the inequality constraints or not is checked. The infeasible solutions are exchanged by the best fea- sible solutions. Step 6: Go to Step 2 until termination criteria is met. The GWO is stopped executing when the maximum number of iterations (generations) is reached or there is no noteworthy improve- ment in the solution. In this paper, the ending criterion is the maximum number of iterations for which most of the grey wolves or search agents are idle. Case studies and numerical results In this article, to evaluate the effectiveness of the recently developed GWO algorithm, it is implemented to solve various non- linear, complex ELD problems considering multiple fuels, transmis- sion losses, prohibited operating zones and ramp rate limits. MATLAB 7.1 Software is used to simulate ELD problems and tested on 2 GHz Pentium IV, 1 GB RAM personal computer. The popula- tion size and the maximum iteration number are taken as 50 and 100 respectively for the test systems under consideration. The four sets of experiments are conducted and the simulation results of the proposed method are compared with various existing methods. Test Case 1: Initially, 10-unit system with multiple fuels and valve point loading effect is considered. Test Case 2: Secondly, 40-unit system with transmission losses including valve point loading effect is considered. Test Case 3: Thirdly, 80-unit system with nonlinearities of valve point loading effect and prohibited operating zones is considered. Test Case 4: Finally, prohibited operating zones and ramp rate limits including valve point loading effect in the 140-unit ELD problem are considered. Test Case 1 A 10-unit system with multiple fuel is considered as test system 1 but transmission loss is not considered in power balance Table 1 GWO solution of ELD for test system 1 (10 unit with multiple fuels, valve point and without loss).

The coef cients of fuel cost functions we have consid- ered are provided in [24]. In this test system, the load demand is taken as 2700 MW. Table 1 shows the optimal generation schedul- ing, fuel type and fuel cost achieved by GWO for Test Case 1. The superiority of the proposed method is evident from its ability to satisfy all constraints and produce feasible results. As GWO technique is stochastic simulation method so random- ness in the simulation result is comprehensible. ELD is a real time problem, thus it is desirable that each run of the program should reach close to optimum solution. Fifty independent trials are exe- cuted to observe changes in the solutions. Since the GWO always accepts the better results, it is expected that the solution should always improve and this may lead to robust result of this problem. To verify the robustness of the proposed GWO method, the statis- tical results of the best, mean and worst cost obtained by GWO over the 50 trial runs are compared with the results of PSO [54], GA [54], TSA [54], PSO-LRS [17], IGA-MU [17], NPSO-LRS [17], NPSO [17], ARCGA [17], FAPSO [55], NAPSO [55] and KHA [45]. The com- parative statistical results are summarized in Table 2. The statisti- cal results show that the best, worst and mean cost produced by GWO is least compared with other methods emphasizing its better solution quality.

Convergence characteristic of the GWO for this test system is presented in Fig. 1. Test Case 2 To verify the validity of the method for medium size ELD prob- lem, a slightly complicated power system with forty thermal power units is considered. The transmission loss is taken into con- sideration for this test system. The total load demand is considered as 10,500 MW. To validate the proposed GWO based approach, its simulation results for this test system is compared with the results of SDE [56], GA-API [57], TLBO [42], QOTLBO [42] and KHA [45]. The best solutions, optimal generation scheduling and comparison with other optimization methods in the literature are summarized in Table 3. It can be observed from Table 3 that the proposed tech- nique provides signi cantly better results in comparison with the previously developed techniques. Hence, it may be concluded that the GWO optimization is computationally more well organized than the other methods in terms of quality of solution. Moreover, the results of the proposed GWO method are com- pared in terms of minimum cost, mean cost and maximum cost over 50 runs with the results of GA-API [57], SDE [56], TLBO [42], QOTLBO [42] and KHA [45].

Pradhan et al. / Electrical Power and Energy Systems 83 (2016) 325 334 obtained from the proposed method is better than other tech- niques reported in the literature. Convergence characteristic of the GWO approach for 40-generator test case is depicted in Fig. 2. Test Case 3 In order to validate the feasibility of the proposed GWO method for the EED problems, it is employed on a relatively large system consisting of 80 generating units. The load demand used in the simulations is 21,000 MW. In order to judge the ef cacy of the pro- posed in nonlinear environment, the valve-point effect and prohib- ited operating zones are considered. However, to keep the test system intact, the transmission loss is not taken into consideration in this case. The full system data are taken from [55]. Table 5 illus- trates the optimal generation schedule of 80 generating units and fuel cost obtained using the proposed GWO method. The simula- tion results clearly suggest that GWO produces feasible solutions. To judge the superiority and robustness, the statistical results obtained by the proposed GWO algorithm are compared with those obtained by PSO [55], NPSO [55] and FAPSO [55]. The statistical results of the aforesaid methods are illustrated in Table 6. The com- parative results show that the proposed GWO method outperforms the other techniques. The convergence characteristic of fuel cost obtained by the proposed GWO technique is shown in Fig. 3. The graph shows that the proposed method smoothly converges to the optimal solution. Test Case 4 To explore the opportunity of the GWO to the large scale power system, experiments are conducted on the Korean power system [56]. This system is a large and complicated system having 140 generating units each having valve point loading effects, ramp rate limits and some units having prohibited operating zones. The total load demand is set to 49,342 MW. The transmission loss of this test system is neglected. The system data including fuel cost coef - cients are adopted from [56,58]. The optimal economic dispatch scheme achieved by the proposed GWO algorithm along with SDE [56] is shown in Table 7. It is clear that for this large and com- plex system, GWO ef ciently converges in the vicinity of the opti- mal solution with full constraint satisfaction. It is also clear that the algorithm proposed by this paper can lower the fuel cost effec- tively as compared to SDE. The statistical results of the proposed GWO approach are com- piled in Table 8. The statistical results signify the robustness and superiority of the GWO algorithm compared to existing SDE approach. The nature of convergence characteristic of the proposed GWO for this test system is shown in Fig. 4. This gure shows that the GWO takes few iterations to reach near the optimal solution and there is almost no deviation after 45 iterations in fuel cost. It shows that the proposed GWO method can quickly reach to the optimal solution. Results obtained by the proposed method are encouraging and suitable for the practical systems. Conclusion In this work, an ef cient and comparatively new algorithm named GWO is proposed to solve the ELD problem taking the valve point loading effects, multiple fuel, prohibited operating zone, ramp rate limits into consideration. Four case studies are employed to demonstrate the applicability of the GWO method. The bene t of the proposed GWO is that it does not impose any convexity lim- itations on the generating unit characteristics. Numerical results show that the GWO method has superior features, advantages over other algorithms in terms of robustness, less computational efforts, avoids premature convergence, simple applicability and stable convergence characteristic. Although, the proposed algorithm is applied to solve ELD problems in the current study, it seems from its unique feature that GWO has the potential to solve many other optimization problems in the eld of power system planning and operation.
