Liquid crystal is a versatile medium with high dielectric anisotropy and hence interaction of light with the dielectric metasurfaces immersed in liquid crystal medium show complex behaviour compared to isotropic media. Most of the investigations on liquid crystal based electromagnetic response of dielectric metasurfaces focus on tunability of resonant frequencies and switching between the resonant states as a function of external stimuli such as electric eld, temperature, etc. In the current work we present a detailed investigation of scattering response, near- eld and far- eld radiation pro les of cubic Tellurium metasurfaces as a function of liquid crystal orientations in infrared frequencies. We show that the near- eld and far- eld radiation pro les of primary resonant modes - electric dipoles and magnetic dipoles reorient as a function of liquid crystal orientations. In particular, we study the effect of liquid crystal orientations on novel non-radiative states called anapoles. It is observed that liquid crystal orientations effect the excitation and orientation of anapole states within the Tellurium structures. This paves way for design of an electrically-driven switch between non-radiative and radiative states. Further, controlling the near- eld and far- eld radiation pro les opens up possibilities in designing liquid crystal based tunable multi-functional metasurfaces which can change the directionality of incident light. Introduction In sub-wavelength regime periodic dielectric structures with appropriate design can give rise to Mie responses and exhibit interesting electromagnetic properties such as negative permeability1, negative refractive index2, zero refractive index3, perfect absorption4 and optical chirality5. In plasmonic metasurfaces surface currents give rise to electric resonances and need speci c geometries to exhibit magnetic resonances, where as, in dielectric structures circulating displacement currents are formed within the structures and naturally give rise to both electric as well as magnetic resonances of comparable intensities6 8. Such electromagnetic responses can be easily achieved even with simple geometries such as cubes, spheres or cylinders. In addition, high refractive index dielectric structures give rise to extreme localization of elds and further exhibit novel resonance modes such as non-radiative anapoles and quasi-bound states in continuum (BIC)9 11. Perfect BIC s can not occur in isolated photonic structures owing to the non-existence theorem hence the signi cance of anapoles as the single source for non-radiative states. Tailoring the electromagnetic response of dielectric metasurfaces have signi cant contributions in nanophotonics such as imaging, holography, quantum information and sensing12,13. A variety of tuning mechanisms are being employed to tailor the responses of dielectric metasurfaces such as phase transitions in phase change materials (PCM s), opto-electronic and thermal tuning in liquid crystals, mechanical tuning using MEMS and micro uidic devices, etc13 20. Liquid crystals is a versatile medium that can support tunable, multi-functional and programmable electromagnetic response via thermal, optical, electrical and magnetic tuning13,16,21 26. Liquid crystal (LC) is a versatile medium with high birefringence and high dielectric anisotropy. LC s are being increasingly investigated to design tunable, multi-functional and programmable metasurfaces27. LC medium offers controllability of opto-electronic properties as a function of external stimuli such as electric eld, magnetic eld, concentration and temperature28. LC molecules reorient their optic axis as a function of applied electric eld which in turn reorients the polarization direction of incident light. Hence polarization direction of incident light and its effect on electromagnetic response of dielectric structures embedded in LC can be tuned as a function of the external electric eld. Dielectric metasurfaces embedded in liquid crystals are emerging as a major technology area with applications such as dynamic beam switching29, spatial light modulators30, metalens31, chiral metasurfaces32, electrically tunable switches28, color lters33, tunable second harmonic generation34, varifocal lens35, ultrafast switching36, etc. Most of the literature in liquid crystal based metasurfaces, however, focuses on the tunability of resonance frequencies as a function of LC orientations and switching between the resonant modes as a function of external elds. A comprehensive investigation of the near- eld and far- eld radiation patterns at these resonance frequencies as a function of LC orientations and the LC tunability of novel modes such as anapoles is absent in the literature. In the current work we perform detailed investigation of such effect of liquid crystal medium on the electromagnetic response, near- eld and far- eld radiation of the resonant modes. Anapoles were rst observed in the magnetic elds and has attracted considerable attention in the eld of metamaterials as a possible realization of radiationless objects. In dielectric metasurfaces anapole states are formed as a result of destructive interference between electric dipole and toroidal dipoles9,37,38 giving rise to highly localised elds within the dielectric structures. Anapoles exhibit high Q-factors39 and tailoring the anapoles give rise to unprecedented applications in sensing40,41, non-radiative waveguides42, wireless power transfer43, high harmonic generation44 and non-linear optical responses45. Further, perfectly transmitting hybrid anapoles (HA s) are also observed recently in high refractive index dielectric structures formed due to the destructive interference between all possible multipoles with their toroidal counterparts46. Anapoles in the literature are usually observed with speci c designs of dielectric metasurfaces such as toroidal meta-atoms, dielectric trimers, hollow disks, etc10,44,47 49. In our earlier work, we showed that stable anapoles can also be formed in simple structures such as high refractive index Tellurium cubes50. Tailoring the formation of anapoles is highly useful in the areas of communication and stealth technologies and has been achieved till now by tailoring the geometries51, periodicity52 and active materials53. In the current work, we investigate the effect of electrically driven anisotropic LC medium on tailoring the anapole states and their orientations in near and far- eld, thus opening up various possibilities in applications of programmable non-radiative modes. Design and Simulation: In the present work, electromagnetic response of Te cubic structures is studied by solving Maxwell s equations using nite element method (FEM) simulations in commercially available CST software. 2D array of Tellurium (Te) cubic resonators each with dimensions 1.0 m x 1.0 m x 1.0 m and lattice constant 2 m is placed on a glass substrate of thickness 5 m as shown in the gure 1a. Thickness of the cell is taken as 10 m along Z-direction and periodic boundary conditions (PBC s) are applied along X and Y directions. Liquid crystal (LC) in nematic phase is lled between the micro-structured bottom glass plate and top glass substrate of thickness 5 m. Nematic phase is characterized by zero translational order and non-zero orientational order. One can de ne an average direction, director along which a macroscopically large number of LC molecules orient in nematic phase. Dielectric anisotropy of liquid crystal (5CB) in nematic phase is taken as = 1.43 in the current simulations54. Suppose the optic axis of LC lies in XY plane with all the molecules aligned along X-direction initially, the external electric eld reorients the director axes to n = {cos ,sin ,0}, where is the angle between +X-axis and director. The permittivity tensor of the LC is then represented by = + cos2 cos sin 0 cos sin + sin2 0 0 0 In the above matrix = || , and || = n2 e and = n2 o, where n0 and ne are the ordinary and extraordinary refractive indices, respectively, of the LC. In our simulations we considered the case in which top and bottom substrates do not induce any alignment and orientations of the LC director axes within the cell are varied in the range 0 -90 in XY-, YZ- and ZX-planes, respectively, as illustrated in the gure 1a. In practice, Te microstructures induce changes in the director eld surrounding them such as topological surface defects as a result of surface anchoring and geometry, giving rise to suppression in the scalar orientational order parameter. In the current simulations we assumed very weak random surface anchoring and the topological changes in the director con guration due to geometry are ignored. Plane wave of light in the frequency range 30 70 THz is incident on the bottom substrate along Z-axis (normal to the plane of metasurface) with polarization direction along Y-axis and H- eld along X-axis. Incident light undergoes reorientation of its polarization direction along the long axis of the liquid crystal molecules as it passes through the medium. The refractive index of Te cubes is taken as 5.7( = 33.5 and = 1 respectively) in the frequencies considered55. Earlier studies on these Te cubic structures in air medium showed a re ection band in metamaterial regime with novel resonant modes such as non-radiative anapoles at 62 THz and an absolute transmission state at 60THz apart from the primary electric and magnetic dipole modes56. Electromagnetic response as a function of liquid crystal orientations: Liquid crystal molecules can be reoriented easily in XY, YZ and ZX planes by application of external aligning elds. Figures 1c and 1d show the scattering parameters S11 and S12 as a function of incident frequency in the range 30 70 THz for periodic array of Te structures in air as well as liquid crystal medium. The corresponding phases are represented in gure 1b. Parameters S11 and S12 depicted in gure 1c and d represent backward (re ection) and forward (transmission) scattering parameters de ned 2/12 Figure 1.

Scattering parameters S11 and S12 as a function of incident frequency in the range 30-70 THz, respectively. as S12 = Te(ik0t) and S11 = R, where R and T are re ection and transmission coef cients of medium, k0 is the wave number in free space and t is the thickness of the dielectric layer, respectively. Scattering parameters exhibit a re ection band in the range 40 60 THz with two distinct peaks at both the ends in air medium50. Presence of nematic medium shifts the re ection band to lower frequencies (42-55 THz) with characteristic peaks varying as a function of LC orientation as shown in gures 1c and 1d. The corresponding phases undergo a variation of 2 in the re ection band as observed in gure 1b. In the current work we perform detailed simulations of effect of LC orientations on the electromagnetic response, near and far- eld radiation patterns. At higher temperatures, LC is in isotropic phase ( = 3.05 for 5CB) and gives rise to asymmetric response in the re ection band (red line in the gures 1c and 1d) in the frequency range 42-62 THz with a sharp peak on the right and broader left peak. When the LC molecules are oriented along Y-direction (incident polarization direction) leading to maximum interaction with the incident E- eld, prominent and symmetric peaks are observed at both ends of the re ection band at 45 and 55 THz, respectively. LC orientations along X- and Z-axis give rise to atter re ection bands showing an enhanced collective response from neighbouring dielectric structures. Multipole analysis of the scattered radiation is performed to analyse the electromagnetic response obtained from the scattering parameters. In order to distinguish the contributions from toroidal (T) and electric dipole moments (p) we performed the analysis in Cartesian coordinate system. Multipole contributions to total scattered radiation from the total electric dipole (D), magnetic dipole (m), electric quadrupole ( Q) and magnetic quadrupole ( M) are obtained from the equation57: Esca = k2 0 4 0  [n [D n]]+ 1 vd [m n]+ ikd 6 h n [n Qn] i + ikd 2vd [n ( Mn)]  3/12 Figure 2.

Variation of magnetic (red) and electric (green) dipole resonant frequencies with the LC orientations in XY plane. where n is the unit vector in the radial direction, k0 is the wavenumber in vacuum, kd and vd are the wavenumber and the velocity of the light in the surrounding medium, respectively. D = p + ikd vd T is total electric dipole moment obtained from electric dipole moment p and the toroidal dipole moment T. The electric dipole moment written in terms of the displacement current density J is p = i R Jdr, where J = i 0[n2 1]E and T = 1 10c R [(r J]r 2r2]dr. The de nitions of higher order moments Q and M are followed from the reference57. Multipole analysis is performed at two distances 1.2r0 and 4.0r0 representing near and far- eld regimes approximately, where r0 is the radius of sphere circumscribing the Te cube as shown in gure 2. Multipole contributions from electric dipole (ED), magnetic dipole (MD), electric quadrupole (EQ) and magnetic quadrupole (MQ) are plotted for angles = 0 90 at both near ( gures 2a-2e) and far- eld distances ( gures 2f-2j), respectively. It is observed that in case of LC orientations along Y-direction ( = 0 ) the left peak corresponds to MD and the right peak corresponds to ED in the near- eld ( gure 2a) while in the far- eld distances, left peak corresponds to hybrid mode MD+MQ+ED and right peak corresponds to MD+EQ as shown in the gures 2a and 2f. In case of LC along X-direction ( = 90 ), left peak corresponds to EQ+MD and right peak corresponds to MD in near- eld. At far- eld distances, MD dominates at both the frequencies. For LC along Z-direction, at both near- eld and far- eld distances, the dominant resonant modes are same as along X-direction. While the LC orientations along Y- axis ( = 0 -incident polarization direction) exhibit both the resonant modes at 45THz 4/12 Figure 3. Near and far- eld radiation pro les at left peaks as a function of LC reorientations in XY plane . a)-j). Near- eld electric and magnetic eld pro les in XY planes for LC orientations, = 0 90 respectively. Corresponding scattered far- eld radiation (k-o), electric eld (p-t) and magnetic eld (u-y) at the left peak frequencies, respectively. and 55THz with equal intensity in the re ection band, it is observed that for intermediate angles ( = 20 70 ) the right peak is suppressed while the left peak corresponding to MD remains constant for all angles as shown in the gures 2k and 2n. This phenomenon can also be observed from the multipole analysis at far- eld as shown in gures 2f -2j. The resonance at right peak is completely suppressed at = 45 owing to destructive interference of MD+ED modes as shown in the gure 2g. Hence we report that in-plane orientations of LC molecules help in selectively suppressing or enhancing a particular resonance mode giving rise to tunable opto-electronic response. LC orientations in YZ-plane exhibit re ection band for angles = 0 45 indicating collective response from neighboring dielectric structures. For angles = 50 90 (closer to Y-axis) the scattering parameters show distinct left and right peaks indicating individual responses dominating over the neighboring interactions as shown in the gures 2l and 2o. In case of LC orientations in XZ plane gures 2m and 2p, scattering responses are found to be independent of the orientations of LC. Figure 3 shows near- eld (within the structures) and far- eld pro les of scattered radiation at left resonance peak indicated as dashed line in gure 2k as a function of LC orientations. XY components of electric and magnetic eld pro les within the structures, gures 3a-3j show MD modes predominantly. We observe that these MD modes rotate within the Te cubes as a function of LC orientations in XY plane. The reorientation angles of MD modes are found to be 0 , 35 ,60 , 50 and 0 with 5/12 Figure 4. Near and far- eld radiation pro les at right peak frequencies as a function of LC reorientations in XY plane. a)-j). Near- eld electric and magnetic eld pro les in XY planes for LC orientations, = 0 90 respectively. Corresponding scattered far- eld radiation (k-o), electric eld (p-t) and magnetic eld (u-y) at the right peak frequencies, respectively. respect to X-axis in response to the LC orientations at = 0 , 30 , 45 , 60 and 90 , respectively. The corresponding far- eld radiation pro les -total scattered radiation (RCS), scattered electric eld (E- eld) and magnetic eld (H- eld) are shown in gures 3k-3y. When LC orientations are along the Y-axis ( = 0 ) and X-axis ( = 90 ), far- eld radiation is dominated by MQ mode. For intermediate angles MD mode dominates the far- eld radiation. This can also be con rmed from multipole analysis at r = 4.0r0 as shown in the gures2f-2j. We further observed that these far- eld MD modes rotate at same angles outside the dielectric structures as within them in XY plane. In case of right resonance peaks (indicated by dashed line in gure 2k) in-plane reorientations of LC ( = 0 90 ) give rise to rotation of ED modes within the Te structures as observed from the near- eld pro les in gure 4. The ED s rotate by angles 0 , 30 ,0 , 45 and 0 , respectively, with respect to X-axis for LC orientations = 0 90 . In the case of intermediate angles = 30 , 45 and 60 the excitation of both MD and ED s can be observed in the near- eld pro les. Our multipole analysis at these angles showed excitation of MD and ED with comparable contributions ( gures 2b-2d). The total scattered radiation, E- eld and H- eld pro les in the far- eld regime, gures 4k-4y show excitation of MQ modes for = 0 and 90 respectively, and presence of both MD and ED modes for intermediate angles. The suppression of scattering parameters S11 in gure 2k at = 45 due to the destructive interference of ED and MD modes con rms our observations. 6/12 Figure 5. Effect of LC orientations on the excitation of anapole states. a). Schematic of anapole states. b) and c). Near- eld electric and magnetic eld distributions at anapole frequencies. In the current work, we demonstrate for the rst time that in dielectric metasurfaces not only the amplitude of scattering response but also the orientation of incident light can be tailored both in the near and far- eld regimes at certain frequencies. Similar rotation of dominant modes can also be demonstrated for out-of-plane LC orientations. Particularly we also note here that symmetries present in the geometry of scatterers play a signi cant role on orientations of primary resonant modes as observed from the near- and far- eld radiation. In our earlier work on periodic Te cubic arrays we observed that radiation-less anapole states are exhibited at 62 THz in air medium50. In the following sections we discuss in detail the effect of in-plane liquid crystal orientations on the anapole states in nematic medium. Effect of liquid crystal orientations on anapoles Anapoles are the non-radiative states obtained due to destructive interference between electric dipole and magnetic toroidal dipole, also called anti-Kerker effect as shown in the gure 5a. In the current work, we use liquid crystal medium as the active medium to induce electrically switchable anapole states in Te metasurfaces. When the Te cubes are immersed in liquid crystal medium (5CB), we observe that there is a signi cant effect of orientation of LC directors on the anapole directions. Near- eld pro les at anapole frequencies show that anapoles orient as a function of angle of polarization (orientation of LC director) in the XY plane as shown in gure 5b and 5c. The rotation angles about Z-axis are smaller compared to the orientation angles of LC, . We con rm the excitation of anapoles using Cartesian decomposition of multipoles9,58. Scattered eld contributions due to electric dipole (p), toroidal dipole (T) and total electric eld D = ikT+p (represented as ETOT in the gures 6) at a distance 1.2r0 are plotted against the incident frequencies for LC orientations = 0 , 30 , 45 and 60 in the gure 6a. The anti-Kerker condition |p| = |ikT| is satis ed for all LC orientations indicated by the suppression in total electric eld (ETOT) as observed from the gures 6a. We further con rmed the anti-Kerker condition by plotting the corresponding phases of T 7/12 Figure 6. Effect of LC orientations in XY plane on the far- eld radiation of anapole states. a) and b). Multipole analysis of toroidal dipole (T), electric dipole (p) and total electric dipole (D) modes in air and LC medium with director orientations = 0 ,30 , 45 and 60 , respectively in XY plane. c) -e). Corresponding total scattered radiation, electric and magnetic far- eld radiations at anapole frequencies. and p in gures 6b. For all the orientations, , T and p have opposing phase directions. We observe that these anapole states identi ed by the suppression in ETOT (dashed lines in gure 6a) shift to higher frequencies as the angle of LC orientation increases. Far- eld radiation pro les of anapoles in air and LC medium at angles = 0 , 30 ,45 , 60 and 90 are plotted in gures 6c-6e. Total scattered radiation in air and LC medium for = 0 and 90 is dominated by the MQ mode as the total eld due to ED s are suppressed. For intermediate angles = 30 , 60 and 90 , however, there is contribution from both electric and magnetic dipoles giving rise to dipolar radiation in the total scattered eld oriented at different angles in XY plane. Hence presence of LC medium gives rise to non-ideal anapoles as observed both within the structures as well as the far- eld. We further observe directional switching of anapoles, which was not investigated in the literature. Effect of angle of incidence on the electromagnetic response We further investigated the effect of angle of incidence of incident light on the electromagnetic response of periodic Te microstructures. In these simulations polarization direction of incident light is taken along Y-axis and liquid crystal is oriented along X-axis (planar anchoring). The re ection and transmission scattering parameters are shown in the gures 7a and 7b. The left peaks of the re ection band correspond to MD and right peaks to ED for all angles of incidence. It is observed that as the angle of incidence, is varied from 0 to 80 the peaks representing dipoles (indicated by dashed lines in gure 7a narrow down till = 60 , after which, the peaks are suppressed giving rise to broad re ection band spanning the frequency range 42 57 THz. The MD and ED frequencies as a function of theta are shown in the gure 7c. It is observed that MD and ED change their orientation within the structures as observed from the near- eld pro les in gures 7d and 7e respectively. We further performed the analysis using another liquid crystal commonly known as E7 with lesser dielectric anisotropy ( = 0.64)59. Figure 8 shows the transmission of E7 (dashed lines) at LC orientations = 0 and 85 , respectively, as compared to 5CB (solid lines). It is observed that the response band is wider in case of E7 and less pronounced in mid-transmission band indicating enhanced collective response and smaller Q-factors. Another interesting feature of E7 is that the responses due to ED and MD are slightly asymmetric with a sharper ED response compared to MD when the LC molecules are oriented along the polarization direction. For the LC orientations along X-direction, the response band is symmetric. This is complimentary to the response from 5CB. The near eld pro les in gure 8b-8f show ED and MD resonant modes for E7 and 5CB with 8/12 Figure 7. Effect of angle of incidence on the electromagnetic response of Te metasurface a) and b).

LC orientations along X- and Y- directions respectively. It is observed that as the LC orientations coincide with the incident E- and H- directions the corresponding resonant modes are enhanced in both the LC s. While the collective response of Te 9/12 metasurfaces indicated by the response band is in uenced by the liquid crystal chosen, the characteristics of resonant modes remain same for both the LC s. This study helps in selecting the LC relevant for speci c applications such as sensing or broad band applications. Discussion In the current work, we investigated the effect of LC orientations on primary electric and magnetic responses as well as on the non-radiative anapole states. We observed that LC medium in nematic phase induces directionality to the resonant modes both within the Te structures as well as in the far- eld distances as a function of orientation of LC director. A similar work undertaken29 shows the dynamic beam switching between isotropic and nematic phases using external electric eld. In the current investigation we show that not only the far- eld direction of these modes but the orientation of the modes within the structures can be switched as a function of LC orientations. Further, we showed that directionality of anapoles also change as a function of LC orientations even though they are no more completely absorptive for intermediate angles. We observed that electromagnetic response and excitation of resonant modes is strongly effected by angle of LC orientations giving rise to hybrid modes for some angles. Angle of incidence however does not effect the nature of primary resonant modes ED and MD. In the current work, we have not considered topological defects induced by dielectric structures in surrounding nematic medium and hence the heterogeneous director elds. Hence this can be approximated as LC system in the presence of strong aligning elds. In optical frequencies, the defects in nematic medium have signi cant effect on the electromagnetic response, which is not the case in infrared frequencies considered in the current work, References 1.
