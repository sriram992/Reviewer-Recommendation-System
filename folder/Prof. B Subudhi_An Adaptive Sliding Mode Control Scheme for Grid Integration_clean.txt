362 CPSS TRANSACTIONS ON POWER ELECTRONICS AND APPLICATIONS, VOL. 3, NO. 4, DECEMBER 2018 Abstract An Adaptive Sliding Mode Control (ASMC) algo- rithm is developed in this paper for grid synchronization of a photovoltaic (PV) system. This ASMC algorithm minimizes the difference between the reference inverter current and the actual inverter current of the grid connected PV system (GCPVS) during unbalanced loading, grid voltage distortion and variation in solar irradiance. The maximum output power from the PV panel is obtained using modified incremental conductance (IC) MPPT algorithm. Instantaneous power theory (IPT) is employed to transfer active power and reactive power between the PV system, grid and the non-linear load. The ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme is applied to a grid connected PV system firstly using simulation and then on a prototype experimental setup. The performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme is compared with that of sliding mode control (SMC)-IC-IPT scheme. From the obtained results, it is observed that ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme outperforms the SMC-IC-IPT control scheme during transient, steady state and dynamic loading conditions. Index Terms Adaptive sliding mode control, grid synchro- nization, Lyapunov function, total harmonic distortion. I. Introduction I N view of the load disturbance and uncertainties in para- meters e.g. voltage, current, resistance, inductance of a grid connected PV system, designing an appropriate control algorithm is important. Also a number of non-linear control algorithms have been proposed for a PV system such as Lyapunov based controller [1], two-loop controller, SMC controller [2]. Among the aforesaid non-linear control algorithms, SMC algorithm is popular due to its robustness in face of parametric uncertainties and load variations. However, the SMC algorithm yields chattering in the control signal resulting reduction in control accuracy and high heating losses in the power circuit [3]. Sliding mode observer based adaptive slip ratio control algorithm is proposed in [4] for a hybrid electric vehicle. In [5], the adaptive global fast terminal SMC using fuzzy neural network approaches are proposed for an H-bridge inverter. An adaptive fuzzy SMC [6] is proposed for a two stage single-phase grid connected PV system. An adaptive SMC is also developed for a single-phase grid connected PV system in [7]. The contribution of this paper lies in designing an ASMC- IC-IPT scheme for a three-phase grid connected PV system. The robustness of the ASMC-IC-IPT scheme is investigated An Adaptive Sliding Mode Control Scheme for Grid Integration of a PV System Aurobinda Bag, Bidyadhar Subudhi, and Pravat Kumar Ray Manuscript received June 7, 2018.

The performance of the ASMC-IC- IPT is evaluated in both simulation and an experimental setup with grid voltage distortion, load variation and change in solar irradiance. The rest of the paper is organised as follows. The modified incremental conductance MPPT algorithm is presented in Section II. In Section III, the proposed adaptive SMC scheme is presented that considers uncertainties due to parameter variation and measurements. Section IV describes the instantaneous power theory to estimate the reference inverter current. In Section V , simulation results and discussion are presented. Section VI presents the experimental results with discussion. Section VII provides the conclusion of the paper. II. Adaptive Sliding Mode Control Algorithm The schematic diagram of a GCPVS is shown in Fig. 1. The nonlinear loads I and II are used to verify the performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme, as shown in Fig. 1. A modified IC MPPT algorithm is used to extract maximum power from PV panel [8]. A. Modeling of Grid Connected PV System The dynamic model of the GCPVS can be derived using Fig. 1. (1) (2) (3) where, Icd, Icq are the d-q axis VSI currents, Vgd, Vgq are d-q axis grid voltages, Dd, Dq, are d-q axes duty cycle and , represents the frequency of the grid voltage. B. Assumptions In the GCPVS, there may be some unpredictable electro- magnetic interference during the operation which causes noise while measuring the parameters such as voltage, current through sensors. Also the parameters such as resistance, inductance of inverter interface may vary due to variation in ambient temperature and skin effect. To represent the actual value of these parameters e.g. voltage, current, resistance and inductance which are used by the controller, the following assumptions are taken. 363 (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) where Rc, meas , Lc, meas, Icd, meas, Icq, meas, Vgd, meas,Vgq, meas represent the measured values, K1,est, K2,est, ed,est, eq,est represent the esti- mated values and are the uncertainties due to parametric variations and measurements. C. Design of Adaptive Sliding Mode Control Scheme It is intended to design an adaptive SMC algorithm such that tracking of the reference inverter current is achieved. It is necessary that the magnitude, phase and frequency of the actual inverter current should be equal to the reference inverter current. We choose sliding surfaces as follows (12) where Sd, Sq denote sliding surfaces for d and q axes. In order to maintain the enhanced transient response and to reduce the steady state error, we introduce the integral forms as follows Fig. 1. Schematic Diagram for grid connected PV System. (13) where Kd , Kq are positive constants, ed0 , eq0 are initial errors between the reference and the actual d-q components of inverter current. ed and eq are defined as follows ed = I * cd - Icd , eq = I * cq - Icq So Sd = 0 and Sq = 0 represent the precise tracking of d-q components of inverter current of GCPVS. When the system state reaches the sliding manifolds, the structure of the feedback loop is adaptively altered to slide the system state along the sliding surface. The time derivative of (13) yields (14) Substituting (1) and (2) into (14), yields (15) PV Panel Voltage Source Inverter Lc Ica ILa ILa ILa ILb ILb ILb ILc ILc ILc Lg Iga Vga Vpa Vpb Vpc RL RL Nonlinear Load II Nonlinear Load I CL LL LL Vgb Grid Vgc Igb Igc Lg Lg Icb Icc Lc Lc Ipv Ipv Idc Cdc Vpv Vpv Vdc Modified IC MPPT Vdcref Switching Signals PI Ploss + - Non-Linear Load sign est est sign .

The sensitivity of the controlled system to variation of uncertainties and external disturbances still exists in the reaching phase, before sliding mode occurs, which means that the loss of robustness in the transient state. To guarantee the sliding mode at the initial time instant, the initial conditions of the integrators should be chosen as (21) where Id0 and Iq0 are the initial conditions of the integrator defined as (22) Hence at t = 0 (23) (24) (23) and (24) imply that the system states are on the sliding surfaces at the initial time instant without the reaching phase, and the complete robustness can be obtained during the entire response. Fig. 2 shows the structure of the proposed ASMC employed with the instantaneous power theory for the GCPVS. The reference active power and reactive power for VSI are calculated using the instantaneous power theory. Then the reference inverter current is calculated using (32) and (33). After implementation of ASMC, the required gate signal is generated using (18), which is applied to the VSI. III. Reference Current Generation for VSI We employed IPT and power balance to generate the refer- ence current for VSI. The , components of grid voltage, grid current and load current can be calculated using Clarke transformation as follows (15) can be rewritten as (16) where The control law can be obtained as follows (17) The switching action in (17) may yield chattering owing to presence of sign functions. This can be minimized by intro- ducing a boundary layer. This can be obtained by replacing the sign function by a saturation function sat(S) with narrow region of the sliding surface through which the discontinuities in the switching control action can be avoided. where is a small positive gain i.e. the width of the boundary layer. In order to make the SMC algorithm adaptive considering the uncertainties due to parametric variations and measure- ments as described in Section III-A, the control law can be derived as follows (18) where Icd Icq Icd Icq d q U . sat sat U . 365 TABLE I Parameters for ASMC Scheme dc link capacitor voltage at a fixed value.

(32) (33) IV. Simulation Results The simulation is performed for GCPVS using both non- linear load I and II with ASMC-IC-IPT scheme shown in Fig. 1 in MATLAB/SIMULINK. The performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme is compared with that of the SMC- IC-IPT scheme [8] and summarized in Section V-C. The parameters used for the PV system are given in [8]. The control parameters are given in TABLE I.

The oscillating component of power can be obtained using a low pass filter (LPF) [9]. (29) The dc link capacitor voltage of VSI is measured at the time of operation of VSI. A PI-controller is employed to regulate the dc link voltage. The reference dc link voltage is obtained as the output of the modified IC MPPT algorithm.

Performance of the Proposed ASMC-IC-IPT Using Non- Linear Load I The simulated performance of the proposed ASMC- IC-IPT scheme using non-linear load I (Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 3. The three-phase grid voltage Vga, grid current Iga, inverter current Ica and load current ILa for ASMC-IC- IPT scheme are shown in Fig. 3(a), (b), (c) and (d). From Fig. 3(b), (c) and (d), it can be observed that, the total load current, 26.6 A is the summation of PV-VSI current, 15.1 A and the grid current, 11.5 A. The total load active power, 3.9 kW, is the addition of PV-VSI output power, 2.2 kW and the grid power, 1.7 kW, which is seen from Fig. 3(e), (f), and (g). The load reactive power, 200 VARs is supplied by PV-VSI system. Therefore, the grid power factor as shown in Fig. 3(h) is unity. The grid voltage and current for phase a are in the same phase, which is seen from Fig. 3(i). B. Performance of the proposed ASMC-IC-IPT Using Non- Linear Load II The performance for ASMC-IC-IPT scheme using non- linear load II (Fig. 1) is shown in Fig. 4. The three-phase grid current, grid voltage and current for phase a and grid current THD are shown in Fig. 4(a), (b) and (c) respectively. It is seen from Fig. 4(c) that, the THD of grid current obta- ined in ASMC-IC-IPT scheme using non-linear load II is 2.82%, which is slightly more than that obtained from Fig. 6(b) using non-linear load I. This may be due to inclusion of capacitor in the nonlinear load II. C. Performance of the ASMC-IC-IPT Under Grid Distortion The simulation results for ASMC-IC-IPT scheme under grid voltage distortion are shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 5(a), (b) Fig. 3.

The ASMC-IC-IPT scheme reduces the grid current THD from 29.35% to 2.80% and the SMC-IC-IPT scheme reduces the grid current THD to 3.38%. D. Comparison Between the ASMC-IC-IPT and SMC-IC-IPT Schemes The THD of grid current and load current using the pro- posed ASMC-IC-IPT scheme are 2.62% and 27% and that of SMC-IC-IPT scheme is 3.24%, which can be observed from Fig. 6(a), (b), and (c) respectively. The steady state response of grid current of ASMC-IC-IPT and SMC-IC-IPT scheme under ideal grid (without grid voltage distortion) are shown in Fig. 7(a). From Fig. 7(a) it is observed that, the grid current is made sinusoidal in 0.055 s using ASMC-IC- IPT scheme, but it takes 0.08s in SMC-IC-IPT scheme. The ASMC-IC-IPT scheme shows fast response to that of SMC- IC-IPT scheme under steady state condition. The transient response of grid current of ASMC-IC-IPT and SMC-IC- IPT scheme is compared in Fig. 7(b). The response of grid current is shown during the time, the load current of phase a is disconnected from 0.5s to 0.51s. The grid current is made sinusoidal instantly (just after connected to the load of phase a ) using ASMC-IC-IPT scheme, but it takes 0.01 s to that of SMC-IC-IPT scheme. So it is observed that in ASMC-IC- IPT scheme, the grid current adaptively made sinusoidal just after connection of the load of phase a . V. Experimental Results The output power of solar simulator is fixed at 100 W. The dc capacitor voltage is kept at 100 V fixed. The parameters used in the experimental setup are given in [8]. The picture of the experimental setup is shown in [8]. Performance Fig. 5. Steady state performance of ASMC-IC-IPT and SMC-IC-IPT algorithm under grid voltage distortion: (a) Grid current.

In both the cases 98% MPPT efficiency is achieved. A. Transient Performance of ASMC-IC-IPT The dynamic performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme using non-linear load I is shown in Fig. 8. Fig. 8(a) shows the grid voltage vga, grid current iga, load current iLa, inverter current ica of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme when non-linear load is added to phase a . It can be observed from Fig. 8(a) that, the grid current is sinusoidal even during the addition of non-linear load of phase a . Fig. 8(b) shows the grid voltage vga, grid current iga, load current iLa, inverter current ica of ASMC-IC- IPT scheme when there is a change in dc side resistance of non-linear load I. It can be observed from Fig. 8(b) that grid current, inverter current and load current change smoothly with the change in load resistance. B. Performance comparison of ASMC-IC-IPT and SMC-IC- IPT scheme The performance of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme is compared with that of the experimentation obtained from the SMC- IC-IPT scheme. From Fig. 9(b), it can be observed that the dc capcitor voltage obtained from the SMC-IC-IPT scheme contains 5 V ripple. But 0.5 V ripples appeared in the case of ASMC-IC-IPT scheme as shown in Fig. 9(a). It can be observed from Fig. 10(a) and (b) that, there is 5% overshoot in grid current iga using ASMC-IC-IPT scheme and 25% overshoot occurs in grid current iga using SMC-IC-IPT scheme, when the APF is switched on. C. Performance of the Control Schemes SMC-IC-IPT: Time taken for grid current to make sinusoidal (during load disconnection): 0.01s, Time taken for grid current to make sinusoidal (under steady state): 0.09s, Grid current THD (in %) under steady state with ideal grid (simulation): 3.24%, Grid current THD (in %) under steady state with grid voltage distortion (simulation): 3.38.

VI. Conclusions We proposed a new ASMC-IC-IPT controller for grid synchronization of a PV system, which involves a modified IC MPPT algorithm, to obtain max power from the PV panel during change in solar irradiance. Instantaneous power theory and power balance control theory are used to generate the reference inverter current. The simulation and experimental results of the proposed ASMC-IC-IPT scheme are compared with that of SMC-IC-IPT scheme. From the above results, it is observed that the proposed ASMC-IC-IPT control scheme exhibits robust and fast response even when there is dis- tortion in the grid voltage, change in solar irradiance and dynamic loading conditions. This proposed controller also exhibits superior performance when compared with SMC- IC-IPT controller in terms of reduced overshoot in grid current waveform (25% to 5%) and ripples in dc capacitor voltage ( 5 V to 0.5 V) using the experimental setup. Further, the proposed controller is efficient to bring down the THD of grid current from 3.24% to 2.62% in simulation (without grid voltage distortion), 3.38% to 2.80% (with grid voltage distortion) and 3.6% to 2.9% (without grid voltage distortion) in the experimental setup.
