The WOMAC has been extensively evaluated in populations suffering from osteoarthritis, yet not in femoral neck fracture populations. This study aimed to determine the reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness of WOMAC, compared with SF-12 and EQ-5D, in elderly with a femoral neck fracture. Methods: Reliability was tested by assessing Cronbach s alpha. Construct validity was determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient. Change scores were calculated from the 10 week and 12 months follow-up. Standardized response means (SRM; responsiveness) and floor and ceiling effects were determined. Analyses were performed for patients <80 versus 80 years of age. Results: The WOMAC mean total score was 89 points prefracture in younger patients, increasing from 70 (10 weeks) to 81 (24 months). In the oldest old (i.e., 80 years), these scores were 86, 75, and 78. The stiffness scores were 83, 67, and 76 in the younger group and 85, 80, and 80 in the oldest old. Pain scores were 92, 76, and 87 in the younger and 92, 84, and 93 in the older group. Function scores were 89, 68, and 79 in the younger and 84, 71, and 73 in the older group. Cronbach s alpha for pain, stiffness, function, and the total scale ranged 0.83-0.98 for the younger and 0.79-0.97 for the older group. Construct validity was good with 82% and 79% of predefined hypotheses confirmed in the younger and older group, respectively. Responsiveness was moderate. No floor effects were found. Moderate to large ceiling effects were found for the Pain and Stiffness scales at 10 weeks and 12 months in younger patients (18-36%) and in the oldest old (38-53%). 3 Conclusions: The WOMAC showed a good reliability, construct validity, and responsiveness in both age groups with a femoral neck fracture who were physically and mentally fit prefracture. The instrument is suitable for use in future clinical studies in these populations. Level of Evidence: Diagnostic studies, level I 4 INTRODUCTION Most patients with a femoral neck fracture are treated surgically1, 2. Objective determinants like mortality, complications, and revision surgery were traditionally used for evaluating quality of care. Nowadays, methods to assess the patient s perspective of treatment results are gaining importance3. These subjective patients experiences are quantified using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). PROMs are available for assessing functional outcome and quality of life. For women at risk of hip fractures quality of life was profoundly threatened by falls and hip fractures4, regardless of the type of fracture5. The problem in the hip fracture population is a complex assortment of issues ranging from baseline health and frailty, social isolation and support, mental status and joint function and pain. Different constructs can be assessed in the evaluation of hip fracture treatment. A frequently used disease-specific PROM is the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Osteoarthritis Index). To also cover the complexity of issues, the SF-12 (Short Form-12) and the EQ-5D (EuroQuality of Life, EuroQol-5D) are used for evaluating general health and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). The WOMAC is a disease-specific 24-item questionnaire (scored on a 5-point Likert scale), measuring three domains: pain, stiffness, and function10. The WOMAC was designed for patients with osteoarthritis of the hip and knee11. Translation and cross-cultural validation was performed for different countries, including the Netherlands12-15. The WOMAC has frequently been used in orthopaedic patients, including hip fracture patients16-18. It has been extensively validated in patients who underwent knee and hip arthroplasty following osteoarthritis, but measurement properties in hip fracture patients is undetermined. The aim of this study was to determine the reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the WOMAC, compared with SF-12 and EQ-5D in elderly who sustained a femoral neck fracture. 5 MATERIALS AND METHODS Population Between March 3, 2008 and February 14, 2011, 400 patients with a femoral neck fracture were enrolled in two multicenter trials; 150 were enrolled in the Dutch branch of the HEALTH trial, and 250 in the FAITH trial. Adult patients (aged 50 years) with a low energy femoral neck fracture without other major trauma, who were ambulant prefracture were considered eligible. Patients with a suspected pathological fracture, associated major injuries of the lower extremities, retained hardware or infection around the hip, bone metabolism disorder other than osteoporosis, cognitive impairment, dementia, or Parkinson s disease as well as patient who were not likely to be able to complete follow-up were excluded. Data on gender, age, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, walking status, and living situation were collected. The ethics committees approved this study and all patients signed informed consent. Questionnaires All 400 patients were asked to complete the three multidimensional questionnaires, the WOMAC, SF-12 and EQ-5D in clinic and at each visit to the outpatient department. The SF-12 score ranges between 0 and 100 (best) and consists of a Physical Component Summary (PCS-12) and Mental Component Summary (MCS-12). The SF-12 represents a plausible alternative to the larger 36-item SF-36 for measuring health status, especially in large scale studies with a need to reduce questionnaire length6. The reliability and validity were determined in different populations6, and countries, including the Netherlands7. The EQ-5D is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing HRQoL in elderly patients with a femoral neck fracture8. The domains mobility, self-care, daily activities, pain, and anxiety are tested on a three- 6 point Likert scale, resulting in a utility score (EQ-US) that ranges from 0 to 1 (maximum)9. In addition, patients score their health status on a visual analog scale (EQ-VAS) that ranges from 0 (indicating worst possible health) to 100 (indicating best possible health)9. Data about the prefracture situation were gathered during visits within one week after surgery, other follow-up moments were at 10 weeks, six, 12 and 24 months after surgery. Questionnaires were also completed during a telephone interview at nine and 18 months. Patients did not receive any assistance in their completion of the questionnaires and did not consider the burden of completion too high. If necessary (e.g., due to physical status early in recovery), interview-administered versions were used. Data analysis Data were analyzed with SPSS version 20.0 (IBM Corp. Released 2011. IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Armonk, NY: IBM Corp). Data are reported using the COSMIN checklist19. Outcome scores per follow up moment for the all instruments and subdomains were calculated. Unless mentioned otherwise, all further analyses were performed for two age groups (i.e., <80 years and 80 years) and for 10 weeks and 12 months. The reliability of the WOMAC instrument was tested by determining the Cronbach s alpha as measure of internal consistency. Cronbach s alpha was used as reliability parameter as there was no repetition measurement by different observers or at different time- points per follow-up. Qestionnaires aimed at measuring the same construct (WOMAC Pain, SF-12 Pain and EQ-Pain) were used as repetition measurement20, 21. A Cronbach s alpha within the range of 0.70 to 0.90 was considered acceptable.20. 7 In the absence of a gold standard for hip function after a hip fracture construct validity was determined by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient. Construct validity refers to the extent to which scores on a particular measure relate to other measures in a manner that is consistent with theoretically derived hypotheses concerning the concepts being measured21. Only questionnaires of which the WOMAC total score was available were included. Hypotheses for construct validity were defined before data analysis (Appendix 2). Correlation coefficients of 0.10-0.30 were considered weak, 0.3-0.6 moderate, and >0.6 strong22. Responsiveness is the ability of a questionnaire to detect clinically important changes over time 21. Change scores of the instruments were calculated from the 10 week and 12 months follow up. To assess responsiveness, standardized response means (SRM) were calculated by dividing the mean change by the SD of this change. These effect estimates were interpreted according to Cohen: a SRM of 0.2 0.4 was considered a small effect, 0.5 0.7 moderate, and 0.8 large23. A floor or ceiling effect was considered present if more than 15% of the patients in a sample size of 50 patients achieved the lowest or highest possible score, respectively21. Missing data As the raw data for individual items were analyzed, missing data were not imputed. Source of Funding Research grants were received from Stichting NutsOhra (The Netherlands) and The Netherlands Organization for Health Research and Development (The Netherlands). These organizations had no role in study design, data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, or writing of the report. 8 RESULTS Population Of all 400 included patients 275 were aged <80 years and 125 were aged 80 years (Table 1); 250 patients (62.5%) were female and 386 (96.5%) lived independently. This was similar in both age groups. Prefracture, 325 patients (81.2%) walked without aid; 248 (90.2%) and 77 (61.6%) in the younger and older age groups, respectively. Of the total group, 289 patients (72.2%) had ASA class I/II; 223 (81.8%) in the younger age group versus 66 (52.8% in the oldest old. In the internal fixation group adverse events occurred in 41% of the patients, in the arthroplasty group this was the case in 49%, ranging from bladder infection to revision surgery. Outcome scores Patients aged <80 years reported a mean prefracture WOMAC Total score (Figure 1A and Table 2) of 89 points (SD 15), postfracture the score increased from 70 (SD 22) at 10 weeks to 81 (SD 20) after 24 months. In the oldest old, corresponding scores were 86 (SD 16), 75 (SD 21), and 78 (SD 18). Similar changes in scores were reported for WOMAC Stiffness, WOMAC Pain, and WOMAC Function (Figures 1B-D and Table 2). SF-12 PCS scores decreased after fracture and increased again over time (Figure 2A and Table 2), yet SF-12 MCS remained more stable over time (Figure 2B and Table 2). Likewise, EQ-US scores decreased after fracture and increased again over time (Figure 2C and Table 2), whereas EQ-VAS remained more stable over time (Figure 2D and Table 2). 9 WOMAC reliability Cronbach s alpha for the domains pain, stiffness, function and the total scale were between 0.83 and 0.98 for the younger age group and between 0.79 and 0.97 for the oldest old (Table 3). Construct validity All Pearson correlations were statistically significant at a p<0.01 (2-tailed; Table 4). In six main hypotheses, 28 components were predicted, of which 23 (82%) were correctly hypothesized a priori in the younger age group and 22 (79%) in the oldest old. Unconfirmed predictions were mainly underestimations (hypothesis 3). WOMAC Stiffness correlated moderately (r>0.35-0.55) with all other scores, while weak correlations (r= 0.1-0.3) were expected. WOMAC Pain correlated strongly with EQ-US (r = 0.74 in the younger age group and 0.72 in the oldest old), whereas moderate correlation (r 0.3-0.6) was expected. Responsiveness Descriptive statistics and responsiveness is presented in Table 5. The SRM was moderate for WOMAC Function (SRM 0.64) and the WOMAC Total score (SRM 0.66). WOMAC subscales Pain and Function showed small SRMs, ranging from 0.21 to 0.30. Floor and ceiling effects None of the WOMAC domains nor the Total score showed a floor effect. No ceiling effects were found for the Function domain or the Total score in either of the age groups (Table 6). Pain and Stiffness showed a ceiling effect at 10 weeks and 12 months postsurgery for the younger age group (18-36%) as well as for the oldest old (38-53%). 10 DISCUSSION The current study was the first to determine reliability, validity, and responsiveness of the WOMAC, compared with the SF-12 and EQ-5D, in elderly patients who sustained a femoral neck fracture and who were physically and mentally fit prefracture. Results indicated that WOMAC is a reliable and valid PROM for these patients in patients aged <80 years and 80 years. Responsiveness was also sufficient, indicating the instrument can be used for measuring changes in scores over time. (Sub)scores of all PROMs showed similar patterns over time. Scores reduced (most likely immediately) post surgery; from 10 weeks after surgery onwards a gradual increase over time was noted. After two years the scores approximated the prefracture scores, indicating a small residual decrease in mental and physical functioning. Due to differences in symptom evolution, the clinimetric results from osteoarthritis populations are not readily applicable to hip fracture populations. The minimal clinically important change (MIC) for hip fracture patients has not been reported, yet changes in WOMAC Pain and Function were larger than the MIC reported for hip replacement after osteoarthritis (10 points for pain and 8-9 points for function)24, 25. There may be two reasons why changes in WOMAC over time were smaller than observed after hip replacement for osteoarthritis (for pain: 53 points at baseline to 94 two years after surgery and from 50 to 92 for function)26. First, true baseline scores for hip fracture patients (i.e., between fracture and surgery) would have been much lower. Although these scores are unknown (as asking patients to complete questionnaires before surgery is not feasible), we expect these scores to be even lower than preoperative scores in osteoarthritis patients26. Calculating changes in WOMAC scores relative to baseline would have resulted in much larger changes over time. Second, at the first follow-up moment (10 weeks) rehabilitation likely has progressed 11 considerably already in the majority of patients, as participation required patients to be fit prefracture. The construct validity of the WOMAC instrument was good, with 82% (<80 years) and 79% ( 80 years) of the predefined hypotheses being true. Especially the strong correlations of WOMAC Function and Total score with SF-12 PCS, SF-12 Total score and EQ-US support the preferred use of WOMAC for assessing functional recovery in this population. Responsiveness of the WOMAC instrument as a whole was moderate in patients <80 years, as the SRM was 0.66. In the oldest old, the SRM was small (0.24). For hip fracture patients the SRM has not been shown before. However, for patients with hip osteoarthritis the SRM of the WOMAC exceeded 1.027, 28, this is mainly due to much larger changes in score between the two measurements. Larger changes for those patients are expected, as the WOMAC score is at the lowest prior to the hip replacement procedure. These true baseline scores cannot be determined for hip fracture patients. The Dutch version of the non-hip-specific Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment questionnaire (SFMA) appeared to be moderately responsive (SRMs for subscales 0.17-0.47) for patients with a variety of musculoskeletal disorders29. In different Swedish hip fracture populations the SRMs were moderate to large (0.76-0.96) for the SMFA and small to large for the non-disease-specific instruments EQ-5D (SRM 0.01-1.14) and Nottingham Health Profile questionnaire (SRM 0.09-0.98)30, 31. There was no evidence for any floor effect of the WOMAC instrument or for a ceiling effect of WOMAC Function and Total score. In contrast, moderate to large ceiling effects (18- 53%) were found for Pain and Stiffness at 10 weeks and 12 months in both age groups. This is similar as reported32-34. It may reflect the narrow discriminating capacity of these WOMAC domains in the studied population. Some selection bias might have played a role, as patients had 12 to be physically and mentally fit to participate. Participants were ambulant and lived independently prefracture. Strengths and limitations WOMAC has been used for assessing functional outcomes and quality of life in hip fracture populations before35, 36. In the current study, it was validated in hip fracture populations for the first time. Rates of adverse events in these populations doesn t seem to differ from literature, they may have affect the scores, but not the validity of the questionnaire. We consider the novelty of validating WOMAC for hip fracture patients a strength of our study. Moreover, we consider the studied populations representative for a daily practice hip fracture population and believe the results apply to a generally fit hip fracture population. Whether or not WOMAC is also valid for use in frail elderly remains unknown, as patients that were non-ambulatory prefracture and patients with e.g., Parkinson s disease, pathological fractures, and dementia were excluded. Another strength was the built-in very short period, only several days postfracture, for the self-reported, pre-injury disability evaluation to be completed, minimizing the risk of recall bias37. A limitation could be the use of arbitrary hypotheses for construct validation, although they were predefined in compliance with clinimetric evaluation guidelines19. Second, some selection bias might have led to overestimation of the outcomes, especially ceiling effects. This effect is also known from the Harris Hip Score which is frequently used in orthopedic research, but no gold standard exists for functional evaluation of hip fracture populations38, 39. Third, data completeness was not 100% at each time point. One can imagine that patients were not able to complete the forms especially if they were in bad condition. These 36% missing 13 items causing a missing WOMAC Total score might have influenced the outcomes resulting in the current more favorable mean outcome scores and large ceiling effects. CONCLUSION The WOMAC, a widely used disease-specific questionnaire, shows adequate reliability and construct validity in patients aged 50 years or older with a femoral neck fracture who were physically and mentally fit prefracture. Responsiveness was better for younger patients than for patients 80 years. It is therefore a suitable instrument for use in future clinical studies in this population. 14 REFERENCES 1.

Changes in functional outcome scores over time Mean and SD are shown for the WOMAC Total score (A), WOMAC Stiffness score (B), WOMAC Pain score (C), WOMAC Function score (D), and per follow up moment. Higher scores represent better functional outcomes. 22 Figure 2. Changes in quality of life scores over time, separated by age group (A) SF-12 Physical Component Summary (PCS) and (B) SF-12 Mental Component Summary (MCS) are from the Short Form-12 (SF-12) instrument; (C) EuroQol-5D Utility Score (EQUS) and (D) EuroQol-5D Visual Analog Scale (EQVAS) are from the EQ-5D score. Higher scores represent a better quality of life. Mean and SD are shown per follow up moment. For the SF-12, the dotted line shows the standardized mean (50 points) of the general population, the shaded area is the area within 1 SD deviation from this mean (10 points). 23 Table 1.

Hypotheses for evaluating the construct validity of the WOMAC Instrument 1. WOMAC Pain was expected to correlate strongly (r >0.6) with SF-12 pain and EQ-Pain since they were expected to measure the same construct. 2. A moderate correlation (r <0.6) was therefore predicted between WOMAC Pain and all other scores since they assess different or less specific constructs. 3. A weak (r <0.3) correlation was expected for the specific WOMAC Stiffness and all other outcomes. 4. WOMAC Function was predicted to correlate strongly with SF-12 PCS, SF-12 pain, SF-12 Total score, EQ pain, EQ-US, and EQ-VAS. 5. A moderately to weak correlation was expected for WOMAC Function with SF-12 MCS. 6. WOMAC Total score was predicted to have a moderate correlation with SF-12 MCS and a strong correlation all other outcomes.
