Liblau,3* and Lennart T. Mars* CD8 T cells are emerging as important players in mul- tiple sclerosis (MS) pathogenesis, although their direct contribution to tissue damage is still debated. To assess whether autoreactive CD8 T cells can contribute to the pronounced loss of oligodendrocytes observed in MS plaques, we generated mice in which the model Ag in- fluenza hemagglutinin is selectively expressed in oligo- dendrocytes. Transfer of preactivated hemagglutinin- specific CD8 T cells led to inflammatory lesions in the optic nerve, spinal cord, and brain. These lesions, associ- ating CD8 T cell infiltration with focal loss of oligoden- drocytes, demyelination, and microglia activation, were very reminiscent of active MS lesions. Thus, our study demonstrates the potential of CD8 T cells to induce oligo- dendrocyte lysis in vivo as a likely consequence of direct Ag-recognition.Theseresultsprovidenewinsightswithre- gard to CNS tissue damage mediated by CD8 T cells and for understanding the role of CD8 T cells in MS. The Journal of Immunology, 2008, 181: 1617 1621. T he immune effector mechanisms contributing to tissue damage in multiple sclerosis (MS)4 are only partially elucidated. The heterogeneity of MS likely reflects a varying contribution of humoral factors, T cell subsets, and ac- tivated macrophages/microglia. Indirect evidence suggests that the role of CD8 T cells has been largely underestimated to date. Indeed, CD8 T cells accumulate within active MS lesions where they often outnumber CD4 T cells (1 3). These CNS-infiltrat- ing CD8, but not CD4, T cells exhibit oligoclonal expansion, a likely consequence of their local Ag-driven activation (3). Moreover, myelin-reactive cytotoxic CD8 T cells have been identified in MS patients, sometimes more frequently than in controls (4, 5). Finally, active MS plaques exhibit MHC class-I expression on CNS oligodendrocytes and neurons/axons (6), which become potential targets of CD8 T cells. Altogether, these data suggest that CD8 T cells may be mediators rather than regulators of CNS inflammation and damage in MS. Although the loss of oligodendrocytes, the CNS myelin-pro- ducing cells, is a key feature of MS lesions, the precise contri- bution of CD8 T cells to oligodendrocyte death and to CNS demyelination is unknown. It has been shown in vitro that my- elin-specific CD8 T cells can kill isolated HLA-matched oligo- dendrocytes (4), but data in vivo are less compelling. Previous studies have shown that CD8 T cells are necessary for the de- velopment of a full-blown pathology in animal models of neu- roinflammation, but their Ag specificity is still unknown (2, 7, 8). Similarly, a role for CD8 T cells in demyelination has been clearly illustrated in viral models of CNS inflammation, but the mechanisms involved have remained contentious (9, 10). My- elin-specific CD8 T cells can adoptively transfer autoimmune encephalomyelitis but the lesions were reminiscent of ischemic injury with the demyelination associated with more global tis- sue damage, and few CD8 T cells actually infiltrated the CNS parenchyma (11, 12). Therefore, the direct effect of CD8 T cells on oligodendrocytes and myelin in vivo is not clear. In this study, to test whether CNS-infiltrating CD8 T cells can directly induce oligodendrocyte death and demyelination, we de- velopedamousemodelcombiningselectiveexpressionofinfluenza hemagglutinin (HA) as a neo-self-Ag in oligodendrocytes with transgenic mice expressing a HA-specific TCR on CD8 T cells.

A conditional expression cassette, encompassing the open reading frame of transmembrane HA placed 3 of a Stop sequence (neoR and a trimer of SV40 polyadenylation sites) flanked by LoxP sites (Fig. 1A), was inserted into the PacI-AscI sites of the pROSA26PA vector (15). This gene-targeting vector was then electroporated into 129SV embryonic stem cells. Two embryonic stem cell clones exhibiting homologous recombination were injected into C57BL/6 blas- tocysts to generate chimeras that transmitted the Rosa-Stop-HA allele. These knock-in mice, referred to as Rosa26tm(HA)1Libl, were crossed seven times onto the BALB/c background. Cre-mediated recombination of the Rosa26-Stop-HA locus was assessed by PCR on genomic DNA from different organs. To analyze HA expression, RNA was extracted using TRIzol, contaminating DNA was removed by DNaseI di- gestion (Promega), and a quantitative RT-PCR or a nested RT-PCR approach was followed. In vitro differentiation, GFP transduction, adoptive transfer of HA-specific Tc1 cells, and in vivo cytotoxicity HA-specific Tc1 cells were generated as described and routinely contained 98% pure CD8CD3V8.2 T cells (13). GFP transduction of the HA- specific Tc1 cells was performed using the pLGFPSN retroviral vector and the GPE-86 packaging cell line. At day 6, living CD8 T cells were collected by Ficoll density separation and naive CD8 T cells or Tc1 cells were injected i.v. into immunocompetent recipient mice. Mice were assessed daily. For in vivo cytotoxicity, BALB/c mice were injected or not injected with 2  106 HA- specific Tc1 cells. The next day they all received 20  106 HA-pulsed and 20  106 control peptide-pulsed splenocytes stained with a high (CFSEhigh) or low (CFSElow) concentration of CFSE, respectively. After 24 h, spleens from the recipient mice were analyzed by flow cytometry. Histopathology At the specified time points, mice were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. Tissues were removed and embedded in paraffin. Five micrometer-thick sections were stained with H&E and Luxol fast blue/periodic acid Schiff myelin stain. Immunohistological staining and confocal laser microscope analyses were performed as described previously (13, 14). Results and Discussion Naive HA-specific CD8 T cells are indifferent in mice that express HA as an oligodendroglial neo-self Ag For this study, we designed a mouse model system ensuring spe- cific expression of HA in oligodendrocytes by using a double FIGURE 1.

First, we generated mice, referred to as Rosa26tm(HA)1Libl, in which the HA coding sequence was in- troduced in the ubiquitously active Rosa26 locus but where HA transcription was prevented by an upstream LoxP-flanked Stop cassette (Fig. 1A). The Rosa26tm(HA)1Libl mice were then crossed with the MOGi-Cre mice (14), which express Cre spe- cifically in oligodendrocytes (Fig. 1A). The resulting DKI mice excise the Stop cassette due to MOG-controlled Cre expression, leading to restricted HA expression to oligodendrocytes. The DKI mice exhibited no spontaneous phenotype. PCR analyses of the genomic DNA of DKI and Rosa26tm(HA)1Libl mice confirmed that Cre-mediated recombi- nation occurred only in the CNS of DKI mice (Fig. 1B). As a result, HA transcripts were detected by quantitative RT-PCR only in the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve of DKI mice (data not shown), although HA protein expression in the CNS was below detection levels using immunohistochemistry. Moreover, using a sensitive nested RT-PCR approach, HA RNA was undetectable in extra-neurological tissues (Fig. 1C). Further indirect evidence of oligodendrocyte specificity of the transgene expression was provided upon crossing MOGi-Cre mice with the R26R reporter mice, which are similar in design to the Rosa26tm(HA)1Libl mice apart from the substitution of HA by lacZ. In these mice, LacZ expression was only detected in oligodendrocytes (Fig. 1D). Interestingly, we did not observe any neurological signs upon crossing the DKI mice with CL4-TCR mice (25 CL4-TCR  DKI mice followed for up to 9 mo). Moreover, we did not de- tect any TCR down-regulation or deletion of HA-specific CD8 T cells, as assessed by Kd:HA512 520 pentamer staining (Fig. 2A). Rather, peripheral CD8 T cells appeared indifferent to HA, as they exhibited mostly a naive phenotype (CD25CD69CD62LhighCD44intermediate and retained full proliferative capacity in response to the HA512 520 peptide (Fig. 2, A and B). These data are consistent with a lack of expression and probably also of cross-presentation of HA in the lymphoid organs of DKI mice. Therefore, the MOG-driven HA protein behaves as a sequestered oligodendrocyte Ag in DKI mice. Transfer of effector HA-specific CD8 T cells into HA-expressing mice results in CNS inflammation and demyelination We then decided to test whether effector CD8 T cells can me- diate oligodendrocyte cell death and demyelination in vivo. Ef- fector T cells were first generated by in vitro activation of Kd: HA512 520 pentamer CD8 T cells obtained from CL4-TCR mice using HA peptide, IL-2, and IL-12. The resulting Tc1 cells produce large amounts of granzyme B (GrB) and IFN- (Fig. 2C, left). These cells exhibit potent cytotoxicity to HA- loaded target cells in vivo (Fig. 2D). Next, we transferred these HA-specific Tc1 cells into DKI and control mice. Following i.v. injection of 3  107 HA-spe- cific Tc1 cells, but not naive HA-specific CD8 T cells, 40% of the DKI mice developed an overt monophasic disease peak- ing at day 8 10 and waning by 4 wk posttransfer. The clinical manifestations included weight loss and, in the more severe cases, tremors, reduced mobility, and difficulty to right when overturned without overt paralysis (Table I). In the littermate controls, only one animal exhibited weight loss and none devel- oped any neurological signs (p  0.0004). This Ag-specific, CD8-mediated disease also provides strong evidence for func- tional HA protein expression in vivo in DKI mice. Upon histological analysis, all DKI mice injected with Tc1 cells demonstrated clear CNS pathology from day 5 onwards (Table I). Parenchymal infiltrates were never observed in con- trol littermates injected in parallel with HA-specific Tc1 cells. The pathology of DKI mice was dominant in the optic nerve (Figs. 3 and 4) and spinal cord (Fig. 4) but also affected fre- quently the cerebellum, fornix, and periventricular areas of the brain. Inflammatory lesions were never found in the peripheral nervous system or in non-nervous tissues. Quantification re- vealed that T cell infiltration started on day 5 in the spinal cord, reached its peak on day 9, and declined by day 28 (Fig. 5A). On Table I.

In the optic nerves we found focal areas with reduced myelin density and thin myelin sheaths, suggesting remyelination. We also transferred GFP-transduced Tc1 cells (Fig. 2C, right), allowing us to trace the CNS-invading, HA-specific CD8 T cells. Staining for GFP and GrB revealed that HA-spe- cific Tc1 cells containing GrB granules were detected within CNS lesions of DKI mice (Fig. 4c). Some of the GrB T cells were found in close apposition to carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) or cyclic nucleotide 3-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) oligo- dendrocytes (Fig. 4, c and d). We also detected Tc1 cells with polarized GrB granules facing an oligodendrocyte, suggesting directed degranulation (Fig. 4d). In the inflamed lesions, MHC class I (2-microglobulin) expression was detected on oligoden- drocytes (Fig. 5B). The CD8 T cell infiltration was associated with focal activation of microglia (Fig. 3, h, l, p, and t). Besides the presence of CD8 T cells and activated microglial cells, le- sions consisted of CD4 T cells (1 13% of T cells depending on the time point) and small numbers of B220 B cells (mostly in the perivascular space). Oligodendrocyte and myelin pathology was studied on sec- tions stained for Luxol fast blue, CNPase, and CAII (Figs. 3 and 4). Oligodendrocyte apoptosis, detected by nuclear condensa- tion (Fig. 3g and Fig. 4, e h), was present at early time points in optic nerves and spinal cords of DKI recipients. In the optic nerve of DKI mice, the number of apoptotic oligodendrocytes was 6.9  3.5 per section on day 5 and 15.3  4.8 on day 9, whereas they were virtually absent in control mice. On day 5, some vacuolization and early demyelination was found in the optic nerve (Fig. 3e). From day 9 on, most of the animals ex- hibited extensive demyelination in the optic nerve (Fig. 3, i, m, and q) and more limited demyelination in the brain and spinal FIGURE 3.

In addition, staining for nonphosphorylated neurofila- ment revealed severe axonal damage in active demyelinating le- sions by day 19 (Fig. 5, C and D). Importantly, Ab-mediated depletion of CD4 T cells in vivo had no impact on the severity of CNS inflammation and demyelination (data not shown), ex- cluding their pathogenic contribution in this model. Collec- tively, our data show that demyelinating lesions, sharing many of the attributes of an active MS plaque, can arise when CD8 T cells target oligodendrocytes. The experimental system described here allows the clear as- sessment of the individual role of cytotoxic CD8 T cells by un- coupling them from other adaptive immune mechanisms. Ge- netic GFP labeling of the transferred CD8 T cells permitted the unequivocal tracing of the HA-specific CTLs in situ. Strikingly, we show that numerous HA-specific CD8 T cells enter the CNS and optic nerve parenchyma and colocalize with oligo- dendrocytes, with occasional figures of tight apposition be- tween the two cell types. These data strongly suggest that direct cell contact-mediated cytotoxicity plays a central role in oligo- dendrocyte death and demyelination. It is, however, possible that soluble inflammatory mediators synergize to induce tissue lesions. In conclusion, we generated a mouse model to study the con- tribution of T cell subsets on CNS tissue damage. An analogous transgenic model has been recently used to investigate CD4 T cell reactivity to OVA expressed specifically in oligodendrocytes (16). We focused on oligodendrocyte-specific CD8 T cells be- cause little in vivo information is currently available regarding the pathogenicity of this subset and because both CD8 T cell infiltration and loss of oligodendrocytes are essential features of MS lesions. The novel finding provided by this study is that effector CD8 T cells exhibit a potent deleterious effect on oli- godendrocytes, resulting in an inflammatory demyelinating pa- thology resembling active MS lesions. The exclusive expression of HA in oligodendrocytes is very reminiscent of some myelin self-Ags such as MOG, which are not (or barely) expressed in the lymphoid tissue and therefore fail to tolerize the T cell rep- ertoire (17). This carries an obvious risk of activation of auto- reactive CD8 T cells with subsequent development of autoim- munity. Collectively, these data reinforce the idea that CD8 T cells represent relevant therapeutic targets in MS (1, 2). Acknowledgments WethankA.Flu gel,E.Dardillac,A.Saoudi,andD.Duniaforinputontheproject.

Myelin/oligodendrocyte gly- coprotein-deficient (MOG-deficient) mice reveal lack of immune tolerance to MOG in wild-type mice. J. Clin. Invest. 112: 544 553. FIGURE 5. T cell infiltration and axonal damage in the CNS of DKI mice. A, Quantification of CD3 T cells in the spinal cord and optic nerve of DKI mice at different time points after Tc1 cell injection (Table I). B, 2-Micro- globulin expression by oligodendrocytes in the spinal cord on day 9 (650). C and D, Axonal injury in demyelinating lesions of the optic nerve, detected with SMI311 staining nonphosphorylated neurofilaments (250). By day 9 (C) only some axonal spheroids are present (arrows), whereas at day 18 (D) massive axonal destruction is observed. 1621 The Journal of Immunology View publication stats
