L subshell uorescent X-rays in Dy, Ho, Er, Lu, Ta, W, Pt, Au, Hg, Pb and Bi have been measured using synchrotron with selective creation of electron vacancies in individual subshells. Coster Kronig (CK) yields were derived from the measured intensities. Present measurements have been made at photon energies above the edges where differences between measured and theoretical attenuation coef cients are almost negligible. Parametric trends for the results with Z were developed to cover all Zs in the range of 66 83. The trends predict the switching-off of L1 L2, N1 transition at Z = 67. The extent of fall/rise of fLij values corresponding to off/on of certain transitions is found inversely proportional to the difference in binding energies of two consecutive subshells involved in the transition. For Zs above/below these rises/falls, fL13 and fL12 values are almost constants. fL23 values involving no break at Zs follow the general photoionization behaviour that ionization probability is highest at the edge energy and decreases with photon energy. Yield measurements with synchrotron radiation for Dy, Ho, Lu, Hg and Bi and experimental values for fL23, fL12 in Lu and for fL13 in Ta are being quoted for the rst time. Keywords.

Introduction Vacancy created in one of the lower subshells of a shell by primary ionization shifts to a higher subshell due to faster intrashell non-radiative Coster Kronig (CK) transition in the time interval of the order of 10 17 s before an outer shell electron jumps to ll it. CK transition probability fLij is the probabili- ty of shift of the ith subshell vacancy to the jth subshell of L shell. Thus, CK transitions alter the pri- mary vacancy distribution in the shell before lling of vacancies. Vacancies in more tightly bound L1 sub- shell may shift to L2 or L3 subshell and from L2 subshell to L3 subshell. The probability of a CK tran- sition depends upon the chances of outer shell electron knock out by the energy difference of two subshells i and j of L shell. Therefore, in contrast to other fun- damental atomic parameters related to uorescence processes, those exhibit almost regular variation with atomic number Z, Coster Kronig transition probabil- ities display abrupt discontinuities at certain Zs [1] due to switching-on/off of certain outer shell elec- tron knockouts with threshold CK transition energies [2]. Thus, study of CK transitions becomes consider- ably interesting for checking the con guration of outer shell electrons and the in uence of external environ- ment on these electron bindings. Literature was explored for the existing experimental and theoretical values on L shell CKs. Different groups have measured L shell CK yields for medium and high Z elements employing different experimental methods based on coincidence technique and selective excita- tion techniques with radioactive sources/X-ray tubes in double re ection geometry or tunable synchrotron radiation sources. Coincidence technique is appropriate to determine the yields for L2 and L3 subshells as in K L coinci- dence pattern emission of K 1 and K 2 characteristic 1 33 Page 2 of 12 Pramana J. Phys. (2016) 87: 33 X-rays leads to primary vacancy distribution in L2 and L3 subshells and emission of L X-rays leads to nal vacancy distribution in L2 and L3 subshells, i.e., pri- mary vacancies in L2 and L3 subshells plus vacancies shifted from L2 to L3. Different researchers [3 16] have measured CK yields in rare-earth and high Z elements using radioactive isotopes or photon-induced K L coincidences. Selective excitation technique is the production of a vacancy in the speci c subshell of a shell, gener- ally, implemented either in double re ection geome- try employing radioactive/X-ray tube photon source or with tunable synchrotron photons. It is based on photoionization where reliable values of ionization cross-sections from theoretical calculations or from experimental determinations provide a calibration sys- tem with prior knowledge of primary vacancy distribu- tion in individual subshells. Thus, it becomes the most convenient technique for CK measurements. Since 1976, different researchers [17 24] used double re ection geometries, mostly with 241Am radioactive source, for selective excitation in fLij measurements. Gupta et al [25] measured fL23 for W, Pt, Pb and U using triaxial double re ection geometry with X-ray tube source. Radioactive/X-ray tube sources could be used in limited cases depending on the availability of incident photons as particular nuclear decay ener- gies and, in turn, K X-ray energies of primary targets for selective L subshell excitations in the elements under investigation. In all these measurements, inter- polated values of photoionization cross-sections from the tables of Sco eld [26] were used. Tunable synchrotron photon beam is ideal for selec- tive photoionization of L subshells. Employing the synchrotron photoionization method, Jitschin et al [27] measured fL23, fL12 and fL13 CK yields for Au using a thin sandwich sample (0.25 pm Cu, 0.2 pm Au, 16 pm Al), whereas the Cu foil was used for normal- ization. Werner and Jitschin [28] measured the same for elements, with atomic numbers 72 Z 82, using a thin sandwich sample for normalization in a small vacuum chamber. Sanchez et al [29] measured CK yield of Yb and Ta using pure-element foils in syn- chrotron vacuum chamber. Barrea et al [30] measured CK yield of a thick foil of pure Er in vacuum chamber. Kolbe et al [31] determined CK transition probabili- ties of Au, Pb, Mo and Pd using in-house developed ultrahigh vacuum chamber placed in the focal plane of the synchrotron radiation beam lines. Jitschin et al [27], Werner and Jitschin [28] and Kolbe et al [31] used experimentally determined and Sanchez et al [29] and Barrea et al [30] used theoretical photo- electric cross-section values for subshells at incident photon energies for CK evaluations. The experimental cross-sections determined were from measured atten- uation coef cients after subtracting the coherent and incoherent scattering contributions. Many relativistic/non-relativistic theoretical, tted/ interpolated and semiempirical values for CK yields are also available in literature. Bambynek et al [2] gave theoretical formulation to calculate L shell yields. Krause [32] compiled the tted values of fLij for the elements in the range 12 Z 110. Chen et al [33] gave parameter values based on relativistic Dirac Hartree Slater (RDHS) model for 25 elements in the range 18 Z 100. RDHS is a relativistic Dirac approach for atomic structure evaluations for mul- tielectron system using single determinant Slater s approximation for Hartree s self-consistently com- puted all electron wavefunctions (Atomic Inner Shell Physics by B Crasemann, 1985, DOI: 10.1007/978-1-4613-2417-1). Puri et al [34] used logarithmic interpolation on CK data of Chen et al [33] thereby provided a complete set of RDHS model- based CK yields for 25 Z 96. Oz et al [20] gave semiempirical values of fL12 and fL23 from t to measured values with polynomials in Z. McGuire [35] tabulated L shell CK yields for some elements in the atomic range 13 Z 90 using non-relativistic calculations. In 2003, Campbell provided a complete compilation of measured values of L shell CK yields and quoted large uncertainties (40 50% in fL12, 10 15% in fL13 and 10% in fL23) in the range 71 Z 83. In 2009, he re-assessed the data on uorescence and CK yields for L1 subshell in light of the new experimental data [36] and excluding the values of Sogut [22] and McGuire [35], the uncertainties given were 20 40% in fL12, 15 20% in fL13. In 2012, from the critical analysis of the experimen- tal L shell CK yields from coincidence technique and synchrotron ionization methods, Papp [37] pointed out the need for the measurement of CK parameters as true photoionization cross-sections and true physical parameters. Present review of theoretical/semiempirical and ex- perimental L shell CK yields allocates percentage dif- ferences in available theoretical values of up to 20% in fL23, 69% in fL12 and 33% in fL13 but differences are high, up to 141% in the comparison of theoretical and semiempirical values. Similarly, the percentage differ- ences in theoretical and experimental values of fL23 are up to 48%, 196% in fL12 and 23% in fL13. The Pramana J. Phys. (2016) 87: 33 Page 3 of 12 33 differences among the available experimental L shell CK yields using synchrotron radiation is found to be 0 38% and the same between the synchrotron and other experimental methods for almost all cases is up to 62% and higher (191 742%) in some cases. So, the exploration of L CKs in the region 65 Z 85 concludes in a vast scattered data with frequent and sharp variations of fL13 and fL12 predicted by the the- ory. No single group s extensive measurements are available in the region to support the theory and to cer- tify the facts. Therefore, L CK measurements on the available eleven elements in the range 66 Z 83 were undertaken in a single experiment. Keeping in mind the Papp s [37] suggestions, L sub- shell measurements in the region 66 Z 83 have been attempted with synchrotron photons at selected inci- dent excitation energies, 100 1700 eV away from the edges where the disparity in measured and theoreti- cal extrapolated attenuation coef cients is the least/nil [38]. Thus, the experimentally tested Sco eld s [26] photoionization cross-section values were used for CK parameter evaluations. Moreover, the formulation de- veloped for CK parameters is free from the unknown set-up parameters such as source strength, solid angle and detector ef ciency. The relations involve only the ratio of quantities; counts under the required X-ray photopeaks, photoionization cross-sections and target self-absorption correction factors at two selective pho- ton energies. Moreover, the ratio of quantities involved in the formulation nulli es systematic errors. 2. Experimental set-up and measurements Experimental set-up at RRCAT, Indore, India on Micro- probe-XRF beam line (BL-16), Indus-II synchrotron source [39,40] was used for the measurements on Dy, Ho, Er, Lu, Ta, W, Pt, Au, Hg, Pb and Bi. The entire experimental station was housed in a large radiation shielded hutch. The geometrical set-up in the hutch comprises the sample positioned at 45 to the incident beam in the horizontal deviation geometry. Fluores- cent radiation was detected at 90 with respect to the incident beam with a Peltier-cooled vortex solid-state detector (SII Nano, USA), having an energy resolution of 138 eV at 5.959 keV X-rays. The detector was at a distance of 30 mm from the sample position. To con- ne the beam size, a 200 micron slit was inserted in path of the beam to the target ( gure 1). In synchrotron, generally, normalization of the uo- rescence intensity is done by recording simultaneously the K uorescence of a properly chosen element. Jitschin et al [41] used gaseous sample for which a chamber was evacuated and then lled with 20 mbar Ar, and nally 20 mbar Xe leading to constant amount of gas during measurement. In the present work, counts under the atmospheric argon (Ar) K X-ray peak were collected in the same spectra and used as a tool to nd I0 (source strength) and normalization. Experimental targets of Ta, W, Pt, Au, Pb were in metallic form, Ho from Ho2O3 powder mixed with borax, while that of Dy, Er, Hg and Bi were self- supporting targets from powders of Dy2O3, Er2O3, LuCl3, Hg2Cl2 and Bi2(SO4)3 and styrol [42]. The energies of synchrotron radiation E3, E2 and E1 were picked up to create electron vacancies in selected subshells; only L3, L3 and L2 and all L3, L2 and L1 respectively. The energies along with EL3, EL2 and EL1 edge energies for target elements are listed in table 1. Due to the limited resolution of the detector, L lines were grouped in peaks L1, L , L , L . Peaks L1 and L comprise only L lines feeding the L3 vacan- cies. Due to the higher intensity of L peak to L1, only L group comprising the lines L3 M4,5 was involved in the evaluations of fL23 and fL13. L peak comprises Figure 1.

Therefore, L 1,5 that consists of lines L2 N1,4 was used in fL12 evaluation. The average X-ray energies EL and EL 1,5 were calculated using line energies from tables of Storm and Israel [43] weighted with rel- ative intensities [44]. For each experimental target, two spectra were recorded for suf cient counts under the Ar K X-rays with 2% counting statistics. Typical spectra of Lu after normalization with Ar counts recorded at 10, 10.5 and 11 keV are shown in gure 2.

Formulation and calculations In geometrical arrangement, incident photons of ener- gies E1, E2 and E3, in turn, strike the target at an angle 45 and the emitted uorescent X-rays are detected at an angle 45 normal to the target.

I0(Ei) is the intensity of synchrotron photons at energy Ei striking the target area seen by the detector. In the span of mea- surements, I0(Ei) is diminishing, thus, counts under the argon (Ar) K X-ray peak have been used as a tool to nd I0 (source strength). On solving eqs (2) and (3), (4) and (5), (1) and (3), the relations for CK yield fL23, fL12 and fL13 respectively were found to be fL23 = NL (E2) NL (E3) I0(E3) I0(E2) L (E3) L (E2) L3(E3) L3(E2) 1  L3(E2) L2(E2), (7) fL12 = NL 1,5(E1) NL 1,5(E2) I0(E2) I0(E1) L 1,5(E2) L 1,5(E1) L2(E2) L1(E1)  L2(E1) L1(E1), (8) fL13 = NL (E1) NL (E3) I0(E3) I0(E1) L (E3) L (E1) L3(E3) L1(E1) L3(E1) L1(E1)  L2(E1) L1(E1) + fL12  fL23  ,(9) where I0(E3) I0(E2) = NKAr(E3) NKAr(E2) KAr(E2) KAr(E3) KAr(E2) KAr(E3)  , (10) 33 Page 6 of 12 Pramana J.

(12) In CK evaluations, s were taken from the experi- mentally tested tables of Sco eld [26]; s [45] were calculated using s, the absorption coef cient from XCOM [46]. The CK values determined along with available data are listed in table 2. 4. Results and discussions The methodology followed here for the determination of CK yield is very simple and involves relations (7) (12). Only and factors are required for fLij evaluations in addition to NL , NL 1,5, NKAr counts under L , L 1,5 and argon (Ar) K X-ray peaks, respec- tively. The determined CK values involve uncertainties accumulated from 2% of Ar K X-ray/<0.1% of target L X-ray peak areas, neglecting uncertainties in used data values of s and s. This results in 30% uncertain- ties as the expressions (7) (9) involve the differences in two large terms. Comparison with literature values yields: (1) Extremely good agreement of fL23 with theoretical/ tted value that lends support to the present mea- surements and represents the trustworthiness of the results, but for earlier experimental data, devi- ations are almost 13%. (2) fL12 values in some rare cases show higher devia- tions up to 56% when compared with data of other workers and exceptionally 97% from those of Kolbe et al [31]. On theoretical/fitted data side, re- sults are more deviated from that of Krause [32] and Oz et al [20] results but are close to Chen et al [33], Puri et al [34] and Campbell [1,36]. (3) Results for fL13 are well in agreement with the theoretical and experimental literature values. The present higher deviations are mostly from Krause s and Oz et al s tted data values. In case of measurements with synchrotron method [27 31], there is no reliable justi cation for 153% deviation of fL12 value from that of Kolbe et al [31] data. The listed value of 0.010 0.009 in table 2 of [31] for fL12 in Pb seems to be a typographical error that is too low as compared to other data. Moreover, there is no justi cation in the paper for such a low value. The agreement of the present results with those from synchrotron measurements of other researcher justi- es the use of Sco eld s theoretical photoionization cross-section values at excitation energies away from the edges. Moreover, the results from synchrotron measurements are more justi ed as compared to those from double re ection geometries using radioactive sources, where incident primary K X-rays have energy spread due to the culmination of different X-ray lines under the photopeaks, while synchrotron photons are of single energy. Thus, present investigations clear the ambiguity between the measurements with synchrotron radiation and with some other technique. L subshell CK yields (fLijs) in Dy, Ho, Lu, Hg and Bi are measured for the rst time using synchrotron radia- tion. The experimental data values on fL23, fL12 in Lu and on fL13 in Ta are new additions to the existing data. Present investigations cover 11 elements out of 18 in the Z range 66 83. To generate data for all the 18 elements, results were used to predict parametric trend for L-shell CK parameters with Z on the lines used earlier for M-shell theoretical data, on average uorescence yield [45]. The polynomials in Z were tted to each CK param- eter values with the computer software already devel- oped by Mittal et al [47]. The trials which produced closest agreement with the actual values were consid- ered. For different CK yields the resulting trials are summarized as ln  fLij  = n=+1 or+2  n= 2 an(Z)n, where n is the power of Z that varies from 2 to +1 for fL12 and fL13 parameter ts and 2 to +2 forfL23 t and ans are coef cients of t for the nth power of Z. For each t, the data values were more than the number of coef cients in the relation, ensuring the optimization of parameters. The uniqueness of the relation was jus- ti ed with the fL23 values, where 11 values were grouped in sets of 5 6 values under different permu- tations and combinations. For each combination, the same closeness of tted values with the actual ones represented the uniqueness of the relation. Due to the predicted sudden change at Z=74 [47] in fL12 and fL13 data because of L1 L2, N1,2&3 transition offset and L1 L3, M4,5 transition onset [2], Z region 66 83 has been split into two regions 66 74 and 74 83 for the ts to achieve minimum deviations in tted and exact val- ues. The actual and tted values are listed in table 3 and coef cients of t along with percentage devia- tions of tted values from the actual ones are listed in table 4. Pramana J. Phys.

Table 4 represents the exactness of the tted data where deviation from actual data is <3% in all cases except when Z = 66, 67 and 68, where it is 15% in fL12 values. The large deviations can be assigned to lower energy gap <0.5 keV in L1 L2 levels. Thus, t coef- cient and tted values can con dently be used in applications on CK parameters. The parametric results were minutely analysed for their Z variation pattern by comparing their plots with those of Campbell [1] in gures 4 6. Smooth decrease of fL23 with Z has point of in ac- tion around Z = 74, almost similar to the DHS pattern. fL12 shows sharp fall at Z = 67 and 74 and almost constant pattern in the regions Z = 69 74, 78 80 and 82 83. In Campbell s illustration, near Z=80 there is a small fall contrary to the present results that show a small rise. fL13 patterns in Z = 66 74 and 78 83 regions resemble that of Campbell s [1] illustration but the stagnation at Z =75 77 could not be checked with the current experimental data as it is missing at these elements. To check the sharp transitions in parameter val- ues at certain Z, Sideways, the knockout probabilities of some nearest outer subshell electrons have been explored at intra sub-shell transition energies EL1 EL3, EL1 EL2 and EL2 EL3 for different Z using Sco eld s [26] level energies. For this, plots of the transition ener- gies in terms of binding energy of knocked electron vs. Z are given in gure 7. The overall view of the present results and transi- tion energy plots in gure 7 predicts that fall/rise in fLij values corresponds to off/on of electron knocking probability in the outer subshell. The fall/rise extent is inversely proportional to the gap in the binding energies of two consecutive subshells. 33 Page 10 of 12 Pramana J. Phys. (2016) 87: 33 Figure 4.

(a) Present tted fL13 values vs. atomic number Z and (b) Campbell [1] graph for fL13 values vs. Z. (1) In case of fL23 there is no on/off of electron knock-out probability in the region Z = 66 83 and fL23 shows smooth decrease with Z in con- trast to the plot of transition energies with Z. It re- commends the normal photoionization behaviour that the ionization probability is high for transi- tion energy values nearest to the electron binding energy and the same decreases with increase in transition energy. (2) Current fL12 values have sharp fall at Z = 67 and 74 and almost constant values in regions Z = 68 74, 78 80 and 82 83 with small rise from 66 to 67 and 80 to 82. This predicts the switching-off of transition L1 L2, N1 at Z = 67, though the energy plot represents the switching-off at Z = 68. Further, the extent of these rise/fall are found inversely proportional to the binding energy gap between the consecutive outer subshells. (3) Similarly, in fL13 pattern, sudden rise in values at Z = 68 and 74 due to the onset of L1 L3, M5 and L1 L3, M4 transitions are inversely pro- portional to the binding energy gap between the consecutive outer subshells. Again, in regions Z = 66 68, 71 74 and 78 83, values are almost constant within experimental errors. All these indicate that under the shadows of sharp rise/fall Pramana J. Phys.

Transition energies (a) EL2 EL3, (b) EL1 EL2 and (c) EL1 EL3 in terms of binding energies of knocked-out subshell electron () vs. Z with insets of gures 4a 6a. in fL13 and fL12 values, the values in the Z regions in between the rises/falls are almost con- stants, while fL23 involving no break follows the general photoionization behaviour that transition probability is high for transition energies nearest to the knocking electron binding energy and the same decreases with increase in transition energy. Hence, the present measurements support the theory regarding fall/rise in fL13 and fL12 values and demon- strate the smooth variation of fL23 values with Z (figure 7) as dependence of outer shell electron ionization on incident energy away from the thresholds, i.e., increase in intrashell transition energy with Z results in a decrease in CK fL23 values. 33 Page 12 of 12 Pramana J.

Conclusions Yield measurements with synchrotron radiation for Dy, Ho, Lu, Hg and Bi and experimental values for fL23, fL12 in Lu and for fL13 in Ta are being quoted for the rst time. The agreement of the present re- sults with those from synchrotron measurements of other researchers justi es the use of Sco eld s the- oretical photoionization cross-section values at exci- tation energies near the edges. Moreover, present investigations clear the ambiguity between the mea- surements with synchrotron radiation and from some other technique. Parametric trends for the results with Z were developed to cover all Zs in the range of 66 83. The trends predict the switching-off of L1 L2, N1 transition at Z = 67. The extent of fall/rise of fLij values corresponding to off/on of certain tran- sitions is found to be inversely proportional to the difference in binding energies of two consecutive sub- shells involved in the transition. For Zs above/below these rises/falls, fL13 and fL12 values are almost constants. fL23 values involving no break at Zs fol- low the general photoionization behaviour that ioni- zation probability is highest at the edge energy and decreases with photon energy.
