Among various existing SVM methods, four well-known and widely used algorithms One Against One (OAO), One Against All (OAA), Fuzzy Decision Function (FDF) and Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG) are used here to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and classifying them into one of the arrhythmia groups. The various types of arrhythmias in the cardiac arrhythmias ECG database chosen from University of California at Irvine (UCI) to train SVM include ischemic changes (coronary artery disease), old inferior myocardial infarction, sinus bradycardy, right bundle branch block, and others. ECG arrhythmia datasets are of generally complex nature and the results obtained through implementation of four well known methods are thus compared as per their accuracy rate in percentages and the performance of the SVM classifier using One Against All (OAA) technique was found to be of vital importance for classification based diagnosing diseases pertaining to abnormal heart beats. We have also used feature selection on the ECG datasets using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method. It has been observed that after applying feature selection and then performing classification of ECG datasets through SVM based methods, One Against All (OAA) gives better results than classification without feature selection.

Introduction Among various illness human being has suffered from, heart disease is still one of the important problems in the society. Early detection and proper medical treatment of diseases pertaining to heart can save lives of patients in cases of sudden death (Ozbay and Karlik, 2001, Anuradha and Reddy, 2001). Heart beat is stimulated by electric signal which basically originates from the Sino Atrial node (SA) known as heart s natural pacemaker and located at the top of the right chamber or Atrium (RA) in the heart. Any disruption of this pacemaker may cause the heart to beat at an abnormal rate, thereby adversely impacting the circulation of blood throughout the body (Kim et. al., 2008). Arrhythmia is a kind of heart conduction system disease that causes an inefficient heart beat (Song et. al., 2005). It represents abrupt and abnormal ECG beats. In general, arrhythmia is diagnosed by an electrocardiogram procedure. ECG signals are comprised of P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. They are designated by capital letters P, Q, R, S, and T. A typical normal ECG signal is shown in figure 1. The main parameters included for inspection in heart-patients are the shape, the duration, and the relationship with each other of P wave (during normal atrial depolarization, the main electrical vector is directed from the SA node towards the AV node, and spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium. This turns into the P wave on the ECG), QRS complex (The QRS complex reflects the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles. They have a large muscle mass compared to the atria and so the QRS complex usually has a much larger amplitude than the P-wave), and T wave components (QRS complex to the apex of the T wave is referred to as the absolute refractory period. The last half of the T wave is referred to as the relative refractory period) and also R-R interval (The interval between an R wave and the next R wave. Normal resting heart rate is between 60 and 100 bpm). Any changes in these parameters signify an illness of the heart. The entire irregular beat phases are commonly called arrhythmia and some arrhythmias are very dangerous for a patient (Ozbay and Karlik, 2001). Kohli and Verma ./ International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, Vol. 3, No. 8, 2011, pp. 122-131 123 Support Vector Machine based methods have been used to classify the electrocardiogram (ECG) arrhythmias (Kohli et. al., 2010). In classification applications, selecting a proper subset of features is an important task. The goal of feature selection is to reduce the number of features and retain the characteristics necessary for classification. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a statistical method used to select features for classification application. Its purpose is to condense the information in a large set of correlated original features (Zhang et. al., 2010). This paper compares the results of support vector machine based methods for arrhythmias classification in ECG datasets with and without feature selection method. Figure 1: Schematic Representation of Normal ECG This paper is organized into seven sections. Literature review has been discussed in section two. A brief discussion on the multiclass support vector machine methods is presented in section three. For feature selection, principle component analysis based approach (PCA) has been discussed in section four. Section five presents the experimental evaluations. Section six presents the results of all the classification methods including the results of comparison for arrhythmia classification in ECG on the basis of percent accuracy rate obtained. Finally, the conclusion and future work are drawn in section seven. 2. Literature Review An ECG facilitates two major kinds of information; firstly, if the time intervals on the ECG are measured, it helps in determining the duration of the electrical wave crossing the heart and consequently we can determine whether the electrical activity is normal or slow, fast or irregular. Secondly, if the amount of electrical activity passing through the heart muscle is measured, it enables a pediatric cardiologist to find out if parts of the heart are too large or are overworked (Anuradha and Reddy, 2001). Thus, physicians diagnose arrhythmia based on long-term ECG data using an ECG recording system. Physicians interpret the morphology of the ECG waveform and decide whether the heartbeat belongs to the normal sinus rhythm or to the class of arrhythmia (Song et. al., 2005). With the various remote and mobile healthcare systems adapting ECG recorders, are being increased in number these days, the importance of a better and robust automatic arrhythmia classification algorithm is being increasingly acknowledged. The analysis of ECG is basically recognizing its pattern and classifying arrhythmia in real-time. To date, several researchers have made attempts to use SVM and various other classifiers to classify electrocardiograph (ECG) beats. Many algorithms have been proposed over previous years for developing the automated systems to accurately classify the electrocardiographic signals. (Devine and Macfarlane, 1993) used ANN for the detection of left ventricular strain by classifying ST-T abnormalities of the ECG. In the same year, (Hu et al., 1993) investigated the use of ANN for QRS detection and beat classification. They modeled the non-linear background noise using adaptive multilayer perception structure in order to augment the QRS complexities for its more reliable detection. (Silipo et al., 1996) presented a comparison work for ECG classification using two classification techniques; one with supervised; and other with unsupervised learning. (Yu et al., 1998 and Guyon et al.2003) presented the use of feature selection methods for choosing a number of features among the original features. An obvious advantage of using feature selection is reduction in the time and cost of feature acquisition as well as reduction in classifier training and testing time. Feature selection is also helpful in improving classifier accuracy, provided that noisy, irrelevant or redundant features are eliminated. (Song et al., Kohli and Verma ./ International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, Vol. 3, No. 8, 2011, pp. 122-131 124 1993) proposed SVM based arrhythmia classification with the reduction of feature dimensions by linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Since, a SVM is known to have the advantage of offering remarkable performance of classification; in this study we have chosen four well-known and most widely used SVM based methods optimized by feature selection for classification of standard arrhythmia dataset and thereby comparing their accuracy rates obtained for best results. 3. Multiclass Classification Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were originally designed for binary classification. How to effectively extend it for multiclass classification is still an ongoing research issue (Hsu and Lin, 2002, Gunn, 1998). Currently there are two types of approaches for multiclass SVM. One is by constructing and combining several binary classifiers while the other is by directly considering all data in one optimization formulation. The formulation to solve multiclass SVM problems in one step has variables proportional to the number of classes. Therefore, for multiclass SVM methods, either several binary classifiers have to be constructed or a larger optimization problem is needed. Hence in general it is computationally more expensive to solve a multiclass problem than a binary problem with the same number of data. There are four methods for multiclass classification based on binary classification: One Against One (OAO), One Against All (OAA), Fuzzy Decision Function (FDF) and Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG) SVM. Assume 1 1 2 2 {( , ),( , ),...,( , )} l l S x y x y x y = is a training set, where m ix R and (1,2,..... ) iy k . For the One Against-One method (Debnath et al., 2004), one needs to determine ( 1) / 2 k k classifiers for the k - classes problems. The optimal hyperplane with SVMs for class i against class j is ( ) ( ) 0, T ij ij ij D x w x b = + = ,1 ,1 i j j k i k < < < (1) where T ij w is a vector in the feature space, ( ) x is mapping function, and ij b is a scalar. Here the orientation of the optimal hyper plane is defined as per the following equation: Dij(x) = -Dji(x) (2) One-Against-One Method: for the input vector, one computes , 1 ( ) sgn( ( )) k i ij j i j D x D x = = (3) and classifies x into the class 1,..., arg max( ( )) i i k D x = One-Against-All Method: For a k class problem, the One-Against-All method constructs k SVM models. The ith SVM is trained with all of the training examples in the ith class with positive labels and all other examples with negative labels. The final output of the one-against-all method is the class that corresponds to the SVM with the highest output value (Liu et al. 2008).Thus, by solving the optimization problem of SVM using all the training samples in the dataset, the decision function of the ith SVM is ( ) ( ) T i i i D x w x b = + (4) The input vector x will be assigned to the class that corresponds to the largest value of the decision functions. Sample x is classified into the class x = 1,..., arg max( ( )). i i k D x = (5) Fuzzy Decision Function Method: In the FDF method (Liu et al., 2008) for the input vector x , the 1-D membership function ( )( , 1,2,..., ) ij m x i j k = in the directions orthogonal to the optimal separating hyperplanes ( ) 0 ijD x = is defined as follows: 1, ( ) { ( ), ij ij m x D x = 1 ( ) ij D x otherwise In (Tsujinishi and Abe, 2003) the membership functions ( ) i m x are given by 1,..., ( ) min( ( )) i ij j k m x m x = = (6) Using (6), sample x is classified into the class 1,... arg max( ( )) i i k m x = (7) Kohli and Verma ./ International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, Vol. 3, No. 8, 2011, pp. 122-131 125 Using above three SVM methods few of the instances remain unclassified at the end, thereby creating unclassifiable region and then DDAG method was developed as a solution to this issue. Decision Directed Acyclic Graph (DDAG): To resolve the unclassifiable region, the DDAG method developed based on the One Against One scheme. At the top-level classification, one can choose any pair of class, and except for the leaf node, if ( ) ij D x >0, then one can regard x to be not belonging to class j . If 12 ( ) D x >0, it means x does not belong to class 2. Thus it belongs to either class 1 or class 3 and the next classification pair is class 1 and class 3. Thus, the unclassifiable region is resolved but it depends on the tree information. DDAG method is as per figures 1 and 2. Figure 2: One case of DDAG decision function method based on One-Against-One Scheme (Liu et al., 2008) Figure 3: Resolved unclassifiable region based on DDAG Decision Function Method (Liu et al., 2008) 4. Feature Selection Feature selection is the process of selecting a subset of the features occurring in the training set and using only this subset as features in classification. Feature selection serves two main purposes. First, it makes training and applying a classifier more efficient by decreasing the size of the effective features. Second, feature selection often increases classification accuracy by eliminating noisy features. A noisy feature is one that when added to the document representation, increases the classification error on new data. In our proposed classification technique, we have used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method for feature selection (Polat and Gunes, 2007, Kohli and Verma, 2010). Principle Component Analysis based Approach (PCA): PCA is a well-established technique for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. It is based on the assumption that most information about classes is contained in the directions along which the variations are the largest. These directions are called principal components. Figure 3 shows an example of principal components in case of 2 dimensions where first principal component is denoted by pc1 whereas second one is denoted by pc2. The most common derivation of PCA is in terms of a standardized linear projection which maximizes the variance in the projected space. Principle Component Analysis method is useful for data compression, by reducing the number of dimensions, without much loss of information.

Experimental Evaluations The standard multivariate ECG datasets taken here is chosen from the University of California at Irvine (UCI) Cardiac Arrhythmias Database (Murphy and Aha, 2010). The experiments are conducted on a personal computer with 1.5 GHz CPU and 1 GB of RAM. Initially this database contained 452 instances and 279 attributes. But owing to the presence of many missing values and also zero valued columns, it became imperative to preprocess and resize the datasets while maintaining the reliability and relevance of the datasets. Thus, columns containing all zeroes or all missing values were removed first from the datasets, followed by the removal of rows having missing values in the dataset and removal of classes having insignificant number of instances. This resized the datasets to total 377 instances and 166 attributes, distributed into 6 Classes with Class 1 referring to normal ECG, Classes 2 to 5 referring to different classes of arrhythmia and Class 6 referring to the rest of unclassified ones. Table 1 shows different arrhythmia classes with number of instances belonging to each of the classes in the datasets.

The remaining half of the main datasets was used for testing and analysis purpose. Table 2 shows the representation of each of the classes in the training and the testing datasets.

Results (a) Without Feature Selection on ECG datasets: We applied the SVM based methods using Gaussian kernel (Genton et al., 2001, Hsu and Lin, 2002). The kernel parameter and the regularization parameter were empirically optimized and shown in Table III and Table IV respectively, by minimizing the error rate on the validation datasets in order to obtain the best accuracy rate in terms of percentage and thus ensuring better classification of the arrhythmia datasets. A radial basis function (RBF) is a real-valued function whose value depends only on the distance from the origin, so that ( )x x = ; or alternatively on the distance from some other point c, called a center, so that ( , ) x c x c = . Any function that satisfies the property ( )x x = is a radial function. Gaussian function named after Johann Carl Friedrich Gauss is a function of the form ( ) 2 2 2 ( ) x b c f x ae = for some real constants a, b, c > 0, and e 2.718281828. For Arrhythmia classification in ECG data with 166 attributes and 377 instances is taken from the Cardiac Arrhythmias Database of University of California at Irvine (UCI). The experiments are conducted on a personal computer with 1.5 GHz CPU and 1 GB of RAM. Initially this database contained 452 instances and 279 attributes. But owing to the presence of many missing values and also zero valued columns, it became imperative to preprocess and resize the datasets while maintaining the reliability and relevance of the datasets. Thus, columns containing all zeroes or all missing values were removed first from the datasets, followed by the removal of rows having missing values in the dataset and removal of classes having insignificant number of instances. This resized the datasets to total 377 instances and 166 attributes, distributed into 6 Classes with Class 1 referring to normal ECG, Classes 2 to 5 referring to different Classes of arrhythmia and Class 6 referring to the rest of unclassified ones.

After that value was chosen and fixed, which gives highest percentages of accuracy rate i.e. as per Table 5.7, = 4 and accuracy rate is 85.7143 and next the system was converged by classifying it again at various values i.e. 2 3 4 [2 ,......,2 ,2 ] = . As per Table 5.8, it is found that performance wise One Against All method in ECG classification gives better classification results i.e. =4, accuracy rate is 83.7125 percent, than One Against One, Fuzzy Decision Function and Decision Directed Acyclic Graph methods. (c) Comparison of performance: The classification results of arrhythmia in ECG database indicate that among various SVM based methods, one-against-all algorithm shows the highest percentage of accuracy rate. The system was trained and optimized by classifying the dataset at various values. That value was chosen and fixed, which gives highest percentage of accuracy rate; and next, the system was converged by classifying it again at various values. The range of values taken for and values are, 4 3 2 7 8 [2 ,2 ,2 ,......,2 ,2 ] = and 4 3 2 7 8 [2 ,2 ,2 ,......,2 ,2 ]. = It is found that performance wise One Against One algorithm trails behind One Against All method in ECG classification but its results could be competitive at times. FDF and DDAG methods showed poor and constant classification results on ECG dataset. To remove ambiguity over having any potential to improve its performance, DDAG and FDF methods were used for classification with value ranging from 1 to 5000 but no improvement in accurate rate was observed. Clearly, OAO method resulted in the highest accuracy rate but in general, the very high accuracy rate is difficult to obtain. This could be due to the presence of a particular class sweeping maximum share of number of instances in the total datasets. This reflects the further potential of OAO method to give even higher results in cases of ECG datasets with more uniform distribution, thereby ensuring better training of the system. Results are further improved when PCA method is used for feature selection in ECG datasets. Feature selection experiment considers only three classes (namely, Classes 1, 2 and 5), for experimentation as these classes contain the sufficient number of data samples required for the training of the PCA. Table VII and Table VIII shows the classification results when feature selection is used. To fairly compare the performance of classification with feature selection to without feature selection case, we also performed classification experiments by only considering Classes 1, 2 and 5 in without feature selection case. Obtained Kohli and Verma ./ International Journal of Engineering, Science and Technology, Vol. 3, No. 8, 2011, pp. 122-131 130 classification results for this are shown in Table V and Table VI. It is evident from Tables V, VI, VII and VIII that classification accuracy is much better when feature selection is used. 7. Conclusion and future work This paper presents classification of arrhythmia in ECG datasets with various popular and widely used SVM based methods. We have applied some well known classification techniques, viz., One Against One, Decision Directed Acyclic Graph, Fuzzy Decision Function and One Against All to distinguish between the presence and absence of cardiac arrhythmia and classify it in one of the six groups. We have also used feature selection method i.e. Principle Component Analysis method (PCA) on ECG datasets (Classes 1, 2 and 5). We found better classification results with feature selection. SVM is a strong classifier and using various methods it can deliver high performance even with smaller learning data (Song et al., 2005). The obtained results clearly indicate the One Against All method to be the most powerful method for arrhythmia classification in ECG. Acknowledgement We acknowledge Mr. Abhishek K.
