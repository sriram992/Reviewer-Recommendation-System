IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS 1 Lag Synchronization of Switched Neural Networks via Neural Activation Function and Applications in Image Encryption Shiping Wen, Zhigang Zeng, Senior Member, IEEE, Tingwen Huang, Senior Member, IEEE, Qinggang Meng, and Wei Yao Abstract This paper investigates the problem of global exponential lag synchronization of a class of switched neural networks with time-varying delays via neural activation function and applications in image encryption. The controller is dependent on the output of the system in the case of packed circuits, since it is hard to measure the inner state of the circuits. Thus, it is critical to design the controller based on the neuron activation function. Comparing the results, in this paper, with the existing ones shows that we improve and generalize the results derived in the previous literature. Several examples are also given to illustrate the effectiveness and potential applications in image encryption. Index Terms Exponential stability, lag synchronization, switched neural networks. I. INTRODUCTION H YBRID systems have been investigated extensively with the rapid development of intelligent control. As a special case of hybrid systems, switched systems consist of a family subsystems, which are controlled by a switching rule. In reality, many systems can be modeled as switched systems, switched circuits, switched networks, and so on. Considerable attention has been drawn to the theoretical analysis of switched systems [1]. Meanwhile, synchronization of neural networks has attracted great attention due to its potential applica- tions in many elds such as secure communications, biological systems, information science, image encryption, Manuscript received August 12, 2014; revised October 21, 2014 and December 21, 2014; accepted December 27, 2014.

Synchronization phenomena including complete synchronization [15] [17], generalized synchroniza- tion [18], phase synchronization [19], and lag synchroniza- tion [20] have been investigated. In connected electronic networks, time delays are unavoidable due to nite signal transmission times, switching speeds, and the complete synchronization of neural networks with time delays hard to implement effectively, but we can implement lag synchronization. Several control methods have been proposed for the lag synchronization of delayed neural networks, such as periodically intermittent control in [21] [23]. Exponential stability criteria are derived for the synchronization error sys- tems with constant time delays in [21] and [22], however, these criteria are not applicable for systems with time-varying delays. Meanwhile, only asymptotical stability criteria are derived for synchronization error systems in [23]. Li and Bohnerb [24] investigated the exponential synchro- nization of chaotic neural networks via linear matrix inequality techniques. However, there are a few results on global expo- nential lag synchronization of switched neural networks. Motivated by the above discussion, in this paper, we investigate the problem of globally exponential lag syn- chronization for a class of switched neural networks with time-varying delays. It is worth pointing out that, the proposed problem is nontrivial because of the dif culties such as the controller is designed via the neuron activation function. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Section II, preliminaries are given. In Section III, a new model of synchronization error system is formulated within a uni ed framework. In Section IV, synchronization of switched neural networks is discussed by the controller based on the neuron activation function. Several suf cient conditions are derived to ensure the synchronization of switched neural networks. Analysis has been made on results in this paper and the previous ones. In Section V, two illustrative examples are discussed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis. Finally, the conclusion is drawn in Section VI. II. PRELIMINARIES Denote u = (u1, . . . , un)T, |u| as the absolute-value vector, i.e., |u| = (|u1|, |u2|, . . . , |un|)T, ||x||p as the p-norm of vector x, 1 p < . ||x|| = maxi {1,2,...,n} |xi| is the 2 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS Fig. 1. Synchronization scheme of coupled memristive neural networks. in nity norm of vector x. Denote ||D||p as the p-norm of the matrix D. Denote C as the set of continuous functions. A set of neural networks is considered as the individual subsystems of the switched neural network. The driving switched neural network is described as follows: x(t) = Clx(t) + Al f (x(t)) + Bl f (x(t (t))) + I (1) where l is a switching signal taking its value in the nite set I = {1, . . . , N}, which means that the matrices (Al, Bl, Cl) are allowed to take values in the nite set {(A1, B1, C1), . . . , (AN, BN, CN)}. The parameters of system (1) are utilized to re ect the switched property of the electronic elements in neural networks, such as switched resistors and so on. Throughout this paper, we assume that the switching rule l is known priori to the receiver and its instantaneous value is available in real time. The initial condition of system (1) is in the form of x(t) = (t) C([ , 0], Rn), = max{ }, where = max1 l N l, 0 l(t) l. Consider the following response system: x(t) = Clx(t) + Al f (x(t)) + Bl f (x(t (t))) + I. (2) De ne an indicator function (t) = (1(t), . . . , N (t))T , where l(t) = 1, when the switched system is described by the lth mode(Al, Bl, Cl) 0, otherwise (3) with l = 1, . . . , N. Then, the driving switched neural network (1) can be represented by x(t) = N  l=1 l(t)( Clx(t) + Al f (x(t)) + Bl f (x(t (t))) + I). (4) It follows that N l=1 l(t) = 1 under any switching rules. Assume the response system has the same switching law as the driving system y(t) = N  l=1 l(t)( Cl y(t) + Al f (y(t)) + Bl f (y(t (t))) + I + ul(t)) (5) where ul(t)(l = 1, . . . , N) are the controllers. The initial condition of system (5) is in the form of y(t) = (t) C([ , 0], Rn). The synchronization scheme of coupled switched neural networks can be presented as in Fig. 1, in which, we have the synchronization error state via the compare units and the control input. In this paper, we assume the following. A1: For i {1, 2, . . . , n}, the activation function fi is Lipchitz continuous; and r1,r2 R, there exists real number i such that 0 fi(r1) fi(r2) r1 r2 i. A2: For i {1, 2, . . . , n}, i(t) satis es 0 i(t) i, i(t) i < 1. To derive suf cient conditions for the global exponential lag synchronization of system (4) with system (5), we will need the following lemmas. Lemma 1 [25]: Given any real matrices X, Z, P of appropriate dimensions and a scalar 0 > 0, where P > 0, the following inequality holds: XT Z + Z T X 0XT PX + 1 0 Z T P 1Z. WEN et al.: LAG SYNCHRONIZATION OF SWITCHED NEURAL NETWORKS 3 In particular, if X and Z are vectors, XT Z 1/2 (XT X + Z T Z). III. NEW MODEL FOR THE SYNCHRONIZATION ERROR SYSTEM It is hard to obtain real-time inner states of the integrated and packed circuit, the output of this circuit can be utilized to measure such packed circuit. Therefore, we aim to design a controller of the circuit based on its output function, which is also called activation function in neuromorphic circuit, and to reach lag synchronization [y(t) x(t ) for some constant lag time > 0]. The error system can be obtained as e(t) = N  l=1 l(t)( Cle(t) + Al (e(t)) + Bl (e(t (t))) + ul(t)) (6) where e(t) = (e1(t), e2(t), . . . , en(t))T is the lag- synchronization error, and ei(t) = yi(t) xi(t i). (7) The neural activation functions with/without delays are (e(t)) = ( 1(e1(t)), . . . , n(en(t)))T = f (e(t) + x(t )) f (x(t )) (e(t (t))) = ( 1(e1(t 1(t))), . . . , n(en(t n(t))))T = f (e(t (t)) + x(t (t) )) f (x(t (t) )). In the case of packed circuits, it is hard to measure the inner state of the circuits, the controller is dependent on the output of the systems. An output controller is designed in this paper as follows: ul(t) = Kl (e(t)) (8) where Kl = (klij )n n is a constant gain matrix to be deter- mined to synchronize the drive and response systems, and (e(t)) is the output function without delays. With controller (8), the error system (6) is transformed into e(t) = N  l=1 l(t)( Cle(t) + Al (e(t)) + Bl (e(t (t)))) (9) where AL = ( alij )n n = (alij + klij )n n. IV. MAIN RESULTS To gain the main results, the following lemma is introduced. The initial condition of system (9) is in the form of e(t) = (t) (t ) C([ + , ], Rn). Lemma 2: For the lag-synchronization error system (9), if there exist a positive number and positive de nite diagonal matrices L = diag{ 1, 2, . . . , n}, = diag( 1, 2, . . . , n), R = diag(r1,r2, . . . ,rn), and l = 2 L 1 l + R + 2|| ||||Bl||2I < 0 where = min l=1,2,...,N{ min{Cl}}, l = ( lij )n n with lii = 2 i alii, and lij = ( i alij + j alji), for i = j, such that V(t)|(9) /2eT (t)e(t), where V(t) = 2 eT (t)e(t) + 2 n  i=1 i  ei(t) 0 i(s)ds + n  i=1  t t i(t) 2 i (ei(s))rids.

Transient behavior of the switched system (4) with the initial value [0.2 0.2]T . Some criteria about globally exponential stability can be derived for the switched lag-synchronization error system (9) with the controller of the neural activation function [26] [31]. The globally asymptotical stability conditions for for the switched lag-synchronization error sys- tem in [26, eq. (9)] and [27, eq. (9)] are presented as follows.

Corollary 4: The synchronization error system (9) is globally asymptotically stable if there exist a positive de nite diagonal matrices = diag{ 1, 2, . . . , n}, R = diag{r1,r2, . . . ,rn} such that l = 2 I l + R + 2|| ||2||Bl||2 2I < 0 (20) where = min1 i n( i / i), l = ( lij )n n with lii = 2 i alii, lij = ( i alij + j alji), for i = j.

Example 2: Based on Example 1, the obtained results can be applied in the eld of digital signal processing, and the algorithm is presented for a color picture F with a size m n 3, as follows. 1) Separating color image F into three gray ones with red, green, and blue, respectively, and via sort func- tion to rearrange the pixels in each gray image, 8 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS Fig. 6.

As there are three gray images needed to be encrypted, the third chaotic signal can be set as z3(k) = 0.5(x1(k) + x2(k)). After certain transformation, the chaotic signals can be presented as in Algorithm 1. 3) Based on the proceeded chaotic signals and gray images, the encrypted gray images can be obtained as the WEN et al.: LAG SYNCHRONIZATION OF SWITCHED NEURAL NETWORKS 9 Fig. 10.

As the decryption process is the same as the encryption process, is omitted, we notice that as the existence of lag, the decryption chaotic signal should be employed after /h signals, where h is the length of the iterative step. In addition, two simulations about gray and color image encryption have been provided in Figs. 6 11, which illustrate the applica- tion potential of the lag synchronization of switched neural networks in signal encryption. As the existence of the lag between the coupled switched neural networks, decryption chaotic signal should be adopted after certain iterative steps. VI. CONCLUSION As the applications of switched neural networks become more and more popular, lag synchronization of such networks becomes necessary. On the other hand, after the switched neural networks have been packed, it is very hard to measure their inner states. Therefore, the authors investigate the problem of global exponential lag synchronization of a class of switched neural networks with time-varying delays via the neural activation controller. Two numerical examples were provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and improvement of the obtained results in this paper. REFERENCES [1] H. Huang, Y. Qu, and H.-X.
