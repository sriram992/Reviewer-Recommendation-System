136 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA,VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 Position Control of a Flexible Manipulator Using a New Nonlinear Self-Tuning PID Controller Santanu Kumar Pradhan, Member, IEEE, and Bidyadhar Subudhi, Senior Member, IEEE Abstract In this paper, a new nonlinear self-tuning PID controller (NSPIDC) is proposed to control the joint position and link de ection of a exible-link manipulator (FLM) while it is subjected to carry different payloads. Since, payload is a critical parameter of the FLM whose variation greatly in uences the controller performance. The proposed controller guarantees stability under change in payload by attenuating the non-modeled higher order dynamics using a new nonlinear autoregressive moving average with exogenous-input (NARMAX) model of the FLM. The parameters of the FLM are identi ed on-line using recursive least square (RLS) algorithm and using minimum vari- ance control (MVC) laws the control parameters are updated in real-time. This proposed NSPID controller has been implemented in real-time on an experimental set-up. The joint tracking and link de ection performances of the proposed adaptive controller are compared with that of a popular direct adaptive controller (DAC). From the obtained results, it is con rmed that the proposed controller exhibits improved performance over the DAC both in terms of accurate position tracking and quick damping of link de ections when subjected to variable payloads. Index Terms Flexible-link manipulator, position control, self- tuning control, NARMAX, trajectory tracking. I. INTRODUCTION M AJOR challenge in manipulator control is to obtain good accuracy in positioning of the end effector. Rigid- link manipulators possess high structural stiffness. However, these manipulators are quite inef cient in terms of high speed operation and low energy consumption. Also they are unsafe to humans due to high inertia. Alternatively, exible-link manipulators can be used in which inertia is less as a result it gives low energy consumption and high-speed operation [1]. But, while the aforesaid bene ts are achieved, control of Flexible-link manipulators (FMLs) becomes dif cult due to execution of following two tasks namely, rigid body position control and suppression of link-de ection [2]. When a FLM is subjected to an unknown environment due to change in payload it further affects the performance of the feedback control system [3] [5].

Digital Object Identi er DOI: 10.1109/JAS.2017.7510871 objective of the present work is to design an indirect self- tuning PID controller with following objectives: (a) it should exhibit good joint position tracking (b) it ability to estimate on- line higher-order dynamics due to change in payload and (c) it should also suppress the link-de ection considerably. There have been numerous attempts in last three decades to design indirect adaptive controllers for FLMs. One of the earliest works reported in [6], [7], was on indirect adaptive controller applied to a FLM system using linear identi cation. However, the above adaptive controller in [6], [7] has a very limited application for large value of payloads. In [8], [9], a self-tuning controller (STC) for a two-link non-rigid manipulator was designed. But, due to the limitation in the identi cation method structure, there was a discrepancy during experimental valida- tion. To overcome the complexity of neglecting dynamics of higher order for a FLM, an algebraic identi cation based STC was proposed in [10], which was subsequently extended for unknown loads and large payloads with an indirect controller ensuring closed-loop stability. The work in [11] was further extended for large payloads in [12]. A series of simulation and experimental results established that linear identi ed model based STC can be used for FLM when subjected to variable loads. But, the link de ection was still a problem, rst time an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model was used to design a STC control in [13] for a single-link exible manipulator with RLS algorithm to estimate the parameters of this model. Next, a camera was used to control the tip position in designing an adaptive controller using simple decoupled self-tuning control law comprising of the estimation of links natural frequency for a single link exible manipulator in [14]. This work was further extended by adding another sensor called accelerometer and strain gauges in [15]. Recently, there is successful effort to design intelligent PI controllers for FLMs when subjected to variable payloads [16]. Indirect adaptive controllers using a linear model fail to achieve precise real-time adaptive controller for FLM, for different payloads. Further complexity increases if the number of links increases, which gives rise to a multivariable nonlinear system. There are efforts to design nonlinear STC for nonlinear system in [17] and a multivariable STC-PID controller using minimum variance control law in [18]. To incorporate an identi cation technique for estimating these parameter uncertainties, the focus is to design an indirect controller using a nonlinear estimated model with help of a self-tuning controller. The nonlinear autoregressive model is a popular nonlin- ear modeling paradigm since, it requires lesser number of parameters to describe nonlinear system dynamics compared to nonlinear time series representation. Hence, it involves PRADHAN et al.: POSITION CONTROL OF A FLEXIBLE MANIPULATOR USING A NEW NONLINEAR SELF-TUNING PID CONTROLLER 137 less computational burden [19] [26]. Also, there have been several examples where nonlinear autoregressive model based system identi cation is being successfully accomplished for very complex nonlinear systems, For example, in [20], a nonlinear model is used for representing nonlinear ankle dynamics systems and in [21], [22] authors used nonlinear autoregressive model for a rigid manipulator dynamics and random signal respectively. Self-tuning controller based on estimated NARMAX model has been employed in different systems for example, Tri-Axial walking ground reaction forces in [23], a pilot-scale level plus temperature control system in [24]. Owing to the above successful implementation of NARMAX model to estimate complex nonlinear dynamics there is a motivation to design and develop a real-time implementation of a new nonlinear self-tuning controller (NSPIDC) for a Two Link Flexible Manipulator when it is subjected to handle unknown payloads [26]. To validate ef cacy of the proposed NSPIDC its perfor- mances are compared with a popular direct adaptive controller [25]. The objective of our work is to design a nonlinear self- tuning PID controller based on NARMAX model for a two- link FLM. The main features of the proposed control scheme are summarized as follows. 1) The control algorithm has two separate on-line tuning blocks for NARMAX parameters and the PID parameters, respectively. Stability analysis with respect to convergence of the parameter identi cation is also presented. 2) PID controller parameters are calculated based on the relationship between PID control and MVC laws. The paper is organized as follows. Section II presents the dynamic model of the FLM. Section III describes direct adaptive controller for the FLM. Section IV presents the identi cation of FLM using NARMAX model. The proposed adaptive controller for the FLM is described in Section V. Simulation results are presented in Section VI. Experimental results are discussed in Section VII. Concluding remarks are presented in Section VIII. II. DYNAMIC MODEL OF THE FLM A sketch of a planar FLM is shown in Fig. 1, where 1 and 2 are the actuated torque of the Joint-1 ant Joint-2 respectively, d1(l1, t) represents the de ection along Link-1 with length l1 and d2(l2, t) represents the de ection along Link-2 with length l2. The outer free end of the FLM is attached with payload mass, Mp. The dynamics of the FLM can be derived using the Lagrangian approach [5]. The total Lagrangian (L) is difference of total kinetic energy and total potential energy of the FLM system. The total kinetic energy of the can be expressed as (Total kinetic energy due to joints) + (Total kinetic energy due to links) + (Total kinetic energy due to payload Mp) in absence of gravity. The links are modeled as Euler-Bernoulli beams with deformation d1(l1, t) and d2(l2, t) for Link-1 and Link-2 respectively satisfying the link partial differential equation given as (EI)1 4d1 ( l1, t) l1 4 + 1 2d1 ( l1, t) t2 = 0 for Link 1. (1) (EI)2 4d2 ( l1, t) l2 4 + 2 2d2 ( l2, t) t2 = 0 for Link 2. (2) Fig. 1. Sketch of a planar exible-link manipulator carrying a payload mass. Applying boundary conditions in order to solve the above partial differential equations, the boundary conditions used are clamped-free, clamped inertia and pinned inertia. Thereafter assuming two mode of de ection for each link a nite- dimensional model based on boundry conditions and assume mode method [2]. The link de ection for Link-1 and 2 are rewritten using spatial and time coordinate as d1 ( l1, t) = 11 ( l1) 11 (t) + 12 ( l1) 12 (t) (3) d2 ( l2, t) = 21 ( l2) 21 (t) + 22 ( l2) 22 (t) (4) where 11, 12 : Mode shapes (spatial coordinate) of Link-1. 21, 22 : Mode shapes (spatial coordinate) of Link-2. 11, 12 : Modal coordinates (time coordinate) of Link-1. 21, 22 : Modal coordinates (time coordinate) of Link-2. The dynamic model of the FLM is derived by using (1) to (4) for link de ection along with proper boundary conditions as described in (2). The Lagrangian-Euler dynamic equation can be written as d d t L q L q = Q (5) where : Control torque applied. q : N vector of generalized coordinates L : KT UT Q : Input weighting matrix. In (5), substituting the value of total kinetic energy (KT ) and total potential energy (UT ) of the FLM system and solving for q generalized coordinates, i.e., ( 1, 2, 11, 12, 21, 22). Thus, we can write the dynamic model in matrix form as Mrr Mrf Mfr Mff qr qf + Crr Crf Cfr Vff qr qf + 0 0 0 Kff qr qf = i 0 (6) 138 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA,VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 where r, f : Rigid-mode and exible-mode part of the FLM M : Positive de nite symmetric inertia matrix. C : Matrix containing of Coriolis and Centrifugal forces. Kff : Stiffness matrix = diag{kff1, kff2, kff3, kff4}. qr : 1, 2 are joint positions for Joint-1 and 2. qf : 11, 12, 21, 22 modal coordinates for Link-1 and 2 Equation (6) is subsequently used to design an adaptive controller. III. DIRECT ADAPTIVE CONTROL The design of an adaptive controller usually involves choos- ing a control law with tunable parameters. The objective here is to develop a Lyapunov based adaptive control scheme assuring overall system stability for a FLM. The design of this direct adaptive controller (DAC) involves in choosing a control law with tunable FLM parameters and then an adaptation law has to be developed using the closed loop error dynamics. Thus, in order to develop an adaptive controller, the dynamics of FLM in (6) is rewritten as a closed loop error dynamics using the following error signals as e = [ r1 1, r2 2, 11, 12, 21, 22]T (7) and s = e + Pe = sr sf (8) where P : Positive de nite matrix r1,r2 : Desired joint positions for Joint-1 and 2. Using error signals sr, sf de ned in (8), (6) can be rewritten as Mrr Mrf Mfr Mff sr sf + Crr Crf Cfr Vff sr sf + 0 0 0 Kff sr sf = i 0 . (9) The control law is given as i = KDs d f (10) where d = Mrr r + 1 er + Mrf 2 ef + Crr r + 1er +Crf 2ef f = Mfr r + 1 er + Mff 2 ef + Cfr r + 1er +Cff 2ef Kffsf KD is a positive de nite matrix. Due to change in payload, the FLM is subjected to parametric uncertainty and on account of this an adaptive control law is derived. The dynamic equations of a FLM possess the well-known linear-in-parameter property [6]. Using the linear in parameter property, we de ne Y T 1 w1 = Mrr r + 1 er + Mrf ( 2 ef) +Crr ( r + 1er) + Crf ( 2ef) Y T 2 w2 = Mfr r + 1 er + Mff ( 2 ef) +Cfr ( r + 1er) + Cff ( 2ef) Kffsf(11) where, Y1, Y2 denote the regressor matrices. w1, w2 are the vectors of unknown parameters which are replaced by their respective estimates of unknown parameters as w1 and w2 control law in (10) can be rewritten as = KDs d f (12) where d = Y T 1 w1 = Mrr r + 1 er + Mrf ( 2 ef) + Crr ( r + 1er) + Crf ( 2ef) f = Y T 2 w2 = Mfr r + 1 er + Mff ( 2 ef) + Cfr ( r + 1er) + Cff ( 2ef) Kffsf. By de ning w1 and w2 be the parametric estimation errors, the adaptation law can be written as follows w1 = 1Y T 1 sr w1 = 2Y T 1 sf. (13) Using (13), the FLM error dynamics in(9)can be rewritten as Mrr Mrf Mfr Mff sr sf + Crr Crf Cfr Vff sr sf + 0 0 0 Kff sr sf = KDs d f 0 (14) where d = Y T 1 w f = Y T 2 w2. The structure of the control law is shown in Fig. 2. Towards this end, it can be veri ed that the error dynamics (14) along with the adaptation law (13) are asymptotically stable by using Theorem 1. s e Fig. 2. Structure of direct adaptive controller for FLM. Theorem 1: The FLM dynamics described in (6) is to track a reference joint trajectory and simultaneously suppressing the link de ection when it is subjected to carry different payloads (parametric uncertainty). Then, the control law proposed in (10) and the adaptation rule (12) can achieve the above objective in nite time. Proof: To prove this, we de ne a Lyapunov candidate function, V (t) as V (t) = 1 2 sT M s + wT 1 w (15) where M be the mass matrix in (6) and is a symmetric positive de nite matrix. s is a stable rst order differential equation in e. Assuming bounded initial conditions if s 0 PRADHAN et al.: POSITION CONTROL OF A FLEXIBLE MANIPULATOR USING A NEW NONLINEAR SELF-TUNING PID CONTROLLER 139 as t . Thus, differentiating (15) with respect to time leads to V (t) = d dt 1 2 sT M s + wT 1 w = d dt 1 2 sT M ( + r) + wT 1 w = sT h M M r i + 1 2sT Ms + wT 1 w. (16) Substituting for M from the FLM dynamics (6) and using the linear parameterizations of the FLM dynamics in (8), one obtains V (t) = sT Y T w + wT 1 w. (17) Substituting the adaptive control law = KDs d f in (17), we obtain V (t) = sT h wY T KDs aY T i + wT 1 w = sT h w w Y T KDs i + wT 1 w = sT wY T KDs + wT 1 w = sT KDs + wT h 1 wY T s i . (18) If the parameter adaptation rule is w = Y T s, then V (t) = sT KDs 0. (19) It can be seen from (17) that for some positive values of KD, the error functions s converge to zero. IV. IDENTIFICATION OF THE FLM USING THE PROPOSED NARMAX MODEL The FLM dynamics (6) can be rewritten in state space form as x = fi (x) + gi (x) ui. (20) After de ning the state vector, i.e., x = h i, i, i, i iT and fi (x) = M( i, i) 1 c1 i, i, i, i c2 i, i, i, i K 0 i D 0 i ! gi (x) = M( i, i) 1 with input matrix ui = i 0 , where i and i denote the modal displacement and modal velocity for the ith link respectively. The discrete-time approximation of the states of the FLM x(t) in (20) can be obtained using forward difference approxima- tion as x (t) = 1 T [x (kT + T) x (kT)] (21) where T is the sampling-time, x(kT) is the state vector in disctre-time. Similarly, the discrete-time representation of (20) using (21) in nonlinear form can be expressed as xi (k + 1) = Fixi (k) + Giui (k) (22) where xi(k) denotes the joint position of the ith link, ui(k) is the input to the ith joint, Fi represents a multi-input multi- output (MIMO) discrete time nonlinear system matrix and Gi represent a MIMO input matrix. In order to nd the input- output representation of the discrete-time model of the FLM let us de ne a new deformed output for ith link as a result of link de ection de ned in (3) and (4) as yi = i + di (li, t) . (23) In addition, a noise term i(k) is added to (23) in order to corrupt the output of the FLM. Hi (k) = yi (k) + i (k) (24) where Hi(k) is the corrupted output, yi(k) is the noise free output termed as nonlinear auto-regressive (NAR) vector and i(k) is the additive noise input known as moving average (MA) vector and ui(k) is called the exogenous input (X) vector. After collecting and compiling the terms, the overall nonlinear discrete equation is with 19 parameters (Bi(k)) for each link. The structure of the nonlinear discrete-time MIMO representation of the FLM with a tapped delay line (TDL) as a NARMAX model is shown in Fig. 3. Furthermore the NARMAX model of the FLM can be rewritten using on-line estimated parameters in its regressor form as Hi (k) = i (k) Bi (k) (25) where T i (k) = [xi (k Ny) , ui (k Nu) , i (k)]T . xi(k) xi(k) ui(k 1)... ui(k) Hi(k) yi(k) yi(k) Fig. 3. Structure of the (MIMO) NARMAX model of a planar FLM. Fig. 4 shows the structure for on-line recursive identi ca- tion of the NARMAX model parameters. Considering the NARMAX model described in (25) some assumptions and de nition are made as follows. Assumption 1: The system order n and relative degree Ny and Nu are known a priori. Assumption 2: The linear parameters Bi(k) de ned in (25) lie in a compact region Assumption 3: The higher order of the nonlinear terms in the NARMAX model are nite. Next a de nition for bounded input bounded output (BIBO) stability for the above controller is de ned. 140 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA,VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 Pi(k), , yi(k) i(k) (26) (28) yi(k) ui(k) Hi(k) Fig. 4.

Mathematically: supt |u (k)| <+ = supt |y (k)| <+ . The objective is to de ne a NARMAX model based multivari- able self-tuning control for a FLM such that the closed-loop system is BIBO stable, while taking care the position tracking of joint position and link-de ection is improved. Remark 1: The control input u(k) appears with higher order nonlinear terms hence the system is non-af ne. The estimated value of parameters Bi(k) of the NARMAX model (23) can be estimated using a RLS algorithm given in (26) (29). i (k) = Hi (k) T i (k) Bi (k) (26) Gi (k) = Pi (k 1) i (k) + T i (k) Pi (k 1) i (k) 1 (27) Pi (k) = 1Pi (k 1) Gi (k) T i (k) 1Pi (k 1) (28) Bi (k) = Bi (k 1) + i (k) Gi (k) (29) where is the forgetting factor and Pi(k) is the covariance matrix. V. PROPOSED NONLINEAR SELF-TUNING PID CONTROL The proposed multivariable NSPIDC comprises of three main elements. First a representation of the nonlinear FLM dynamics in terms of multivariable difference equation NAR- MAX model, next an on-line recursive parameter estimation using measured input output data, and in the end a minimum variance based control law algorithm that relates the nonlinear estimated parameters to the discrete-time PID control param- eters. A. NARMAX Model Based Self-Tuning PID Controller The input-output mapping of the FLM model represented in terms of NARMAX model in (25) NSPIDC algorithm for the FLM is described as follows. The output of NARMAX model is given by i z 1 Hi (k) = Ti z 1 ui (k Nu) + Vi [Hi (k Ny) , ui (k Nu) , i (k)] (30) where, the polynomials (z 1) and Ti(z 1) are linear in parameters, z 1 is the backward shift operator and Vi[.] is a higher order nonlinear function. In order to design a discrete time multivariable PID control law let us postulate the output of a conventional PID controller in s-domain as UP IDi (s) = KP 1 + 1 TIs + TDs . (31) The PID controller de ned in (31) has the following parame- ters which are as follows: KP is the proportional gain Ti is the integral time constant TD is the derivative time constant. The equation can be transformed into discrete version by applying bilinear transformation, s = (2/T)[(z 1)/(z + 2)], where is the sampling time period: UP IDi (z) = KPi 1 + 1 TIi T 2 z + 1 z 1 + TDiT 2 1 z 1 1+z 1 Ei (z) . (32) Taking inverse Z-transform and putting T = kT0, (32) can be rewritten as UP IDi (k) = KPi " ei (k) + T0 TIi k X i=1 ei (k) + TDi T0 (ei (k) ei (k 1)) # . (33) In order to apply the above equation (33) in real-time a recurrent form of the expression is used [10] UP IDi (k) = KPi h ei (k) ei (k 1) + T0 TIi ei (k) + TDi T0 (ei (k) 2ei (k 1) + ei (k 2)) i . (34) The above equation can be rewritten in terms of a polyno- mial Ciz 1 = c1 c2z 1 + c3z 2 (35) as UP IDi (k) = c1 c2z 1 + c3z 2 ei (k) (36) where c1 = KPi 1 + T0 TIi + TDi T0 c2 = KPi 1 + 2TDi T0 c3 = KPiTDi T0 . Then, using (25) we rewrite (36) in terms of the NARMAX model output as UP IDi (k) = Ci z 1 (Hi (k) ri (k)) .

(38) The polynomial Ci(z 1) for the NSPIDC law is tuned using minimum variance control law. Fig. 5 shows block diagram of the proposed NARMAX based NSPIDC for FLM, and the ow chart of the algorithm for the proposed NSPIDC is described in Fig. 6. In order to tune the PID controller parameters based on the principle of minimum variance, a performance index J is considered as follows: J = X i h Qi z 1 i T (k) Bi (k) + i UP IDi (k) Ri z 1 ri (k) i . (39) where is the expectation operator, i is the weighting factor with respect to the control input in (39) and Qi(z 1), Ri(z 1) are user de ned weighting polynomials with respect to the predicted input is the of the form Qi z 1 = 1 + qi,1z 1 + qi,2z 2. (40) The control law minimizing the performance index J in (39) can be obtained as Fi z 1 i T (k) Bi (k) + Ei z 1 + i i UP IDi (k) Ri z 1 ri (k) = 0 (41) where Ei(z 1) and Fi(z 1) are found out by solving the following Diophantine equation Qi z 1 = Ai z 1 Ei z 1 + z ( di+1)Fi z 1 (42) where Ei z 1 = 1 + ei,1z 1 + ... + ei,kmiz di Fi z 1 = fi,0 + fi,1z 1 + fi,2z 2 (43) Pi(k), , UPID(k) UPID(k) Bi(k) Bi(k) (26) (29) Choose mance satisfied Fig. 6.

(44) Let Ri(z 1) = Fi(z 1), then (44) can be rewritten as Fi z 1 vi i T (k) Bi (k) + UP IDi (k) Fi z 1 vi ri =0. (45) Equating (38) with (45) leads to Fi z 1 vi = Ci z 1 . (46) 142 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA,VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 and based on (36), (45) and (46), the PID parameters KPi, TDi, TIi can be calculated and updated. B. Stability Analysis In order to establish the BIBO stability of a nonlinear FLM system under varying payload due to proposed multivariable self-tuning control in (35), the following Theorem 2 is pre- sented. To prove Theorem 2 for convergence of the identi- ed parameters using the recursive identi cation algorithm, Lemma 1 is presented Lemma 1: The identi cation algorithm (26) to (29) has the following properties 1) lim k ei2 (k) + T i (k) i (k) = 0 2) B (k) B B (0) B with B (0) being bounded 3) lim k B (k) B (k Ny) =0 , nite positive number k Proof: De ne B (k) = B (k) B (k)}, then from (27) we have [ei (k) = T i (k) B (k 1) . (47) From (25) and (47) we can write that B (k) 2 B (k 1) 2 + 2ei (k) T i (k) B (k 1) + T i (k 1) i (k 1) + 2ei2 (k) T i (k 1) 2 [ + T i (k 1) i (k 1)]2 = B (k 1) 2 + 2ei (k) h Hi (k) i (k) i + T i (k 1) i (k 1) + 2ei2 (k) T i (k 1) 2 [ + T i (k 1) i (k 1)]2 = B (k 1) 2 + 2ei (k) h Hi (k) ei (k) i + T i (k 1) i (k 1) + 2ei2 (k) T i (k 1) 2 + T i (k 1) i (k 1) " 2 T i (k 1) 2 [ + T i (k 1) i (k 1)]2 # B (k 1) 2 + 2ei (k) h Hi (k) ei (k) i + T i (k 1) i (k 1) 2ei2 (k) + T i (k 1) i (k 1) Since|ei (k)| = 0 for k , B (k 1) 2 is a non- increasing sequence. Hence B (k 1) 2 is bounded. Then, 1) and 2) in Lemma 1 can be easily obtained. Next, from (28) and (48), we also have, lim k ei2 (k) + T i (k) i (k) = 0. (48) For any nite integer Ny B (k) B (k Ny) 2 = Ny X j=k Ny+1 B (j) B (j 1) 2 Ny Ny X j=k Ny+1 B (j) B (j 1) 2 Ny Ny X j=k Ny+1 ei2 (k) + T i (k) i (k). (49) Using (49) and (50), 3) of Lemma 1 can be easily deduced. Theorem 2: Let us consider the discrete form of the FLM system described in Theorem 1 in NARMAX representation. Also, the FLM parameters not precisely calculated while handling variable payload loads are subjected to NSPIDC such that there exist an upper bound of the parameter for the nonlinear FLM dynamic model and that the closed loop system is BIBO stable. Proof: From (26), we have i (k)= Hi (k) Hi (k) = Hi (k) T i (k) B (k 1) i z 1 Hi (k) = Ti z 1 ui (k Nu) +Vi [Hi (k Ny) , ui (k Nu) , i (k)] .

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The numerical simulation of the proposed NSPIDC was per- formed using MATLAB/SIMULINK. The proposed NSPIDC has been applied to the FLM available in Advanced Control and Robotics Research Lab., NIT, Rourkela. To validate the link trajectory tracking performances of the NSPIDC, the desired trajectory vector for two joints ri(t) for i = 1, 2 are chosen as ri (t) = i (f) 6 t5 td5 15 t4 td4 + 10 t3 td3 (54) where ri(t) = [ r1, r2]T , r(0) = {0, 0} are the initial positions of the links and i(f) = { /4, /7} are the nal positions for Link-1 and Link-2, td is the time taken to reach the nals position which is 4 s and total simulation time is set as 8 s Fig. 7 shows the desired trajectory for Joint-1 and Joint-2. The physical parameters of the FLM are taken from [27]. A. Simulation Results for Controller Performance With an Initial Payload of 0.157 kg Comparisons of performances exhibited by both the adap- tive controllers (DAC and NSPIDC) while carrying a 0.157 kg payload are made in Figs. 7 11. Fig. 8 shows the link de- ection trajectory for Link-2 carrying a nominal payload of 0.157 kg. From Fig. 8 it is seen that the maximum link de ection amplitude is 0.12 m in case of DAC whereas NSPIDC yields the maximum link de ection amplitude of 0.8 m. Further, the de ections are damped out within 4 s before the link attains the nal position in case of NSPIDC, whereas some oscillations in the link de ection are observed in case of DAC. Figs. 9 and 10 show the Link-2 trajectory tracking error curves. From Fig. 9, it is seen that a tracking error of only 0.1 rad is achieved in case of NSPIDC for Link-1. However, the maximum tracking error is more, i.e., 0.25 rad obtained by DAC. Figs. 10 and 11 show the control torque pro les generated by NSPIDC and DAC for Joint-1 and Joint- 2 respectively. The torque pro les show that the maximum torque amplitude of 10 Nm is generated in case of DAC for Joint-1 whereas 1.04 Nm is generated in case of NSPIDC. Also, the torque pro le in case of Joint-2 is 11 Nm for DAC and 5Nm for NSPIDC. Fig. 7. Desired link trajectory for Joint-1 and Joint-2 Fig. 8.

Simulation Results for Controller Performance With an Additional Payload of 0.3 kg In order to test the adaptive performance of the DAC compared to NSPIDC, an additional payload of 0.3 kg is now attached to the existing an initial payload of 0.157 kg. Performances of the two controllers for a 0.457 kg payload are compared in Figs. 12 15. Link de ection trajectory for Link-2 is shown in Fig. 12, which envisages that the maximum link de ection amplitude is 0.16 m due to DAC, whereas in case of NSPIDC, the maximum link de ection amplitude is 0.05 m. Also, damping of the Link-2 oscillations is achieved within 4 s by NSPIDC and DAC yields sustained oscillation. Fig.13 shows the link trajectory tracking error curves for Link- 2. From Fig. 13, it can be seen that there is a tracking error of 0.4 rad in case of DAC for Link-1. However, the tracking error is reduced to 0.2 rad in case of NSPIDC. Figs. 14 and 15 display the control torque pro les generated by NSPIDC and DAC for Joint-1 and Joint-2 respectively. From Figs. 14 and 15, it can be seen that the control input generated by the NSPIDC are 6 Nm and 8 Nm respectively which are less as compared to DAC for Link-1 and Link-2 respectively, when Time (s) Fig. 12.

Thus, NSPIDC needs less control effort for handling an additional payload of 0.3 kg compared to the DAC. C. Comparison of the Controller Performances With Respect to Position Tracking Error The comparison of the adaptive controller with respect to position tracking error for NSPIDC and DAC under 0.157 kg of nominal payload and 0.3 kg of additional load is summa- rized in Table I. For comparison, performance indices such as settling time and maximum overshoot for position trajectory tracking error were chosen. From Table I it is observed that DAC yields a 35 maximum overshoot for a nominal payload and 57 for an additional load of 0.3 kg and in case of NSPIDC the maximum overshoots are 14 and 28, for nominal and additional load respectively. Tip position trajectory error settling times are as follows. It is 4 s in case of NSPIDC and corresponding settling time for DAC is 6 s for a nominal load of 0.157 kg. In case 0.457 kg payload, the settling time for NSPIDC is 4.5 s, and for DAC, it is 7.2 s. Also the comparison with respect to Power Spectral Density (PSD) is performed to check the Power/ frequency for both DAC and NSPIDC for Link-2 de ections when subjected to additional payload of 0.3 kg. The results are shown in Fig. 16, a 28 dB/Hz is estimated for DAC and at the same frequency, and the PSD is 20 dB/Hz for proposed NSPIDC.

The hardware and software components of the ex- perimental set-up are described below. Fig. 17. Photograph of the experimental set-up of the FLM. The hardware components of the FLM constitutes a data acquisition (DAQ) board, two-channel linear current ampli er, a personal computer (PC) with Intel(R) core (TM) 2 DUO E7400 processor which operates at 2.8 GHz clock cycle., an interface board, a two-link exible manipulator with digital optical encoders and two strain gauges at the base of each link. The FLM is provided with one pair of exible links (FL1 and FL2). This pair is made of one three-inch wide steel beam and another beam which is one-and-a-half-inch wide. DAQ board provides two analog-to-digital (A/D) converters on board. Each A/D converter handles four channels, for a total of 8 single-ended analog inputs. Each A/D samples signals from all four channels simultaneously and holds the sampled signals while it converts the analog value to a 14-bit digital code. Each channel includes anti-aliasing ltering and input protection against electrostatic discharge (ESD) and improper connections. DAQ board has 32 channels of digital input- output (I/O). The channels are individually programmable as an input or an output port. All 32 channels may be read 146 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA,VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 or written simultaneously. DAQ board contains four encoder chips, for position measurement each handles two channels, for a total of 8 encoder inputs. All four encoder chips can be accessed in a single 32-bit operation, and both channels can be accessed at the same time per chip. Hence, all eight encoder inputs may be processed simultaneously. There are two 32- bit general purpose counters on the DAQ board which can be used as PWM outputs with 30 ns resolution. For example, each counter can generate a 10-bit, 16 kHz, PWM signal. The FLM is driven by two DC servo motors located at the bottom of the hub and between the joint of two links (MH1 and MH2). They are permanent magnet, brush type DC servo motors which generate a torque i = KtiIi(t), where Ii(t) is motor current for ith joint whereas Kt1 = 0.119 Nm/A and Kt2 = 0.0234 Nm/A. Since the motors are high-speed and relatively low-torque actuators, they are coupled to the joints through a harmonic drive speed increaser with a gear ratio of 1:100 and 1:50 for Joint-1 and Joint-2 respectively. They facilitate in increasing the speed of the motors, needed to accelerate the links. The optical incremental encoder is attached to the DC servo motor making the hub position i digitally available. This digital signal is decoded through an integrated circuitry on the interface board feed-back. In addition to 32 digital I/O channels, the DAQ board has four additional channels for special two digital inputs and two digital outputs. One strain gauge sensor to measure the bending deformation of the link is mounted at the clamped base of each exible link (SG1 and SG2). Each strain gauge sensor is connected to its own signal conditioning and ampli er board. The ampli er board is equipped with two 20-turn potentiometers. The interfacing of software signals for the FLM set-up works on MS Windows operating system with the MAT- LAB/SIMULINK 2007a software. There is a provision of real- time target logic code builder to interface the SIMULINK model. The MATLAB code for controller is built up in the real-time set up by using the real-time target logic code in C language. The PC program written in MATLAB uses C language as a user interface program for the host PC which starts up the DAQ board to interact with it and with the user. A. Experimental Results for Controller Performance With an Initial Payload of 0.157 kg Figs. 18 21 compare the experimental results obtained with DAC and NSPIDC when the manipulator is subjected to carry an initial payload of 0.157 kg. Fig. 18 shows the link de ection trajectories for Link-2 carrying a nominal payload of 0.157 kg. From Fig. 18, it is observed that Link-2 exhibits a link de ection of 0.3 m in case of DAC but less de ection is observed for NSPIDC i.e. the de ection has been reduced to 0.15 m. Fig. 19 shows the tip trajectory tracking error curve. From Fig. 18 it is seen that there is a tracking error of 0.18 rad in case of DAC. However, the tracking error in case of NSPIDC is 0.12 rad. Figs. 20 and 21 show the control torque pro les generated by NSPIDC and DAC for Joint-1 and Joint-2 respectively. The maximum value of control torque is 0.5 Nm and reduces to almost zero after 2 s in case of NSPIDC, whereas for DAC, the maximum value is 9 Nm and it remains at 4 Nm till the link attains its nal position. The torque pro les for Joint-2, in case of DAC attains 12 Nm and reduces to almost zero after 4 s whereas for NSPIDC the maximum input control torque is less i.e. 0.05 Nm initially, then rises to 0.2 Nm and it is maintained at 0.1 Nm till the link attains its nal position.

Experimental Results for Controller Performance With an Additional Payload of 0.3 kg To verify the adaptiveness of the controllers for handling a new payload of 0.3 kg, performances of DAC and NSPIDC for 0.457 kg payload were compared in Figs. 22 25. Fig. 22 shows the tip de ection pro le of the Link-1. Fig. 22 envisages that DAC yields a maximum de ection up to 0.4 m and damps out oscillation at 6 s whereas NSPIDC yields less de ection i.e. 0.2 m and settles at 5 s. Fig. 23 shows the tip trajectory tracking error curves. From the gure, it is observed that, DAC needs less control input for handling a payload of 0.457 kg compared to the NSPIDC. From Fig. 23, it is seen that there is a tracking error of 0.1 rad in case of NSPIDC for Link-1, however, the tracking error in case of DAC is 1.5 rad. Figs. 24 and 25 show the control torque pro les generated by NSPIDC and DAC for Joint-1 and Joint-2 respectively. From Figs. 24 and 25, it is seen that the control input generated by the DAC is almost at 5 Nm whereas in case of NSPIDC the input torque is almost zero after 4 s. Time (s) Fig. 21.

Comparison of the Controller Performances With Respect to Position Tracking Error The comparison of the adaptive controller with respect to position tracking error for NSPIDC and DAC with 0.157 kg of nominal payload and 0.3 kg of additional load is summarized in Table II. The comparison of performance indices such as 148 IEEE/CAA JOURNAL OF AUTOMATICA SINICA,VOL. 7, NO. 1, JANUARY 2020 settling time and maximum overshoot for position trajectory tracking error were chosen. From Table II, it is observed that DAC yields a 32 maximum overshoot under nominal payload and 50 for additional load of 0.3 kg and in case of NSPIDC, the maximum overshoots are 17 and 28, for nominal and additional load respectively. Tip position trajectory error settling times are as follows. It is 4 s in case of NSPIDC and corresponding settling time for DAC is 5 s for a nominal load of 0.157 kg. In case 0.457 kg payload, the settling time for NSPIDC is 5 s, and for DAC the value is 6 s. Also the comparison with respect to PSD is performed to check the Power/ frequency for both DAC and NSPIC for Link-2 de ections when subjected to additional payload of 0.3 kg. The results are shown in Fig. 26. 29 dB/Hz is estimated for DAC and at the same frequency, the PSD is 26 dB/Hz for the proposed NSPIDC.

PSD of the Link-2 de ection with an additional payload of 0.3 kg (Fig. 22). D. Comparison of the Controller Performances With Respect to Simulation and Experimental Results The results obtained from both experiment and simulation in terms of both time domain speci cation as well as frequency spectrum analysis are summarized in Tables I and II. The results show that in terms of maximum overshoot and settling time, the simulation results match with the experimental results with an error margin of 2 5. However, in terms of frequency spectrum analysis the simulation and experimental results for link-de ection show an error of around 5. Therefore, it can be said that the estimated nonlinear NARMAX model identi es the complex nonlinear dynamics of FLM when subjected to variable payload. VIII. CONCLUSION The paper has presented a new self-tuning multivariable PID controller to control joint trajectory and link de ection of a two-link exible manipulator while handling variable payloads based on NARMAX model. The proposed NSPIDC has been applied successfully to a exible robot set-up in the laboratory. From the simulation and experimental results it is established that the proposed NSPIDC generates appropriate adaptive torque when the manipulator is asked to handle additional payload. The reason is that, in case of NSPIDC, parameters are adapted due to change in payload by directly estimating the NARMAX model parameters on-line using a RLS algorithm whereas in case of DAC parameters adaptations are based on Lyapunov direct method.
