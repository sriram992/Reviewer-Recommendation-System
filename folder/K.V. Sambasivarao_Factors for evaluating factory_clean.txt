Parunndekar[1] observes that Indian manufacturing firms have recognized the importance of automating their production systems to meet the chal- lenges posed by the pluralistic market. However, adoption of such automation projects involves large investments and a strategic management style. Meredith and Suresh[2] state that any financial investment in economic activities requires a justification for the purpose of committing capital. The introduction of automation projects (AP) can, and many would say should, include changes in the prevailing management style and in the organizational culture of a firm. Thus, the decision-making process with regard to the selection of AP is quite complex, because the commercial success of the firm is highly dependent on the mechanics of such a process. In addition to the obvious quantitative benefits accruing from the introduction of AP, they can offer a large number of qualitative (intangible) benefits. Datta et al.[3] observed that these are generally difficult to quantify. Researchers have attempted to convert the relative importance of qualitative benefits into priority weights (PW) for procedures involving the selection and evaluation of AP. Mohanty[4] states that project selection and evaluation involve decisions that are critical to the profitability, growth and survival of the manufacturing firm in the increasingly competitive global scenario. Such decisions are complex and require analysis of tangible and intangible attributes. A major problem in the adoption of advanced manufacturing systems is the identification of automation factors (AF) that are mandatory for selection and evaluation of AP. Today most major corporations in India are making attempts to select and implement AP. Mohanty[4]observed that the real-life decision-making process in the project selection is compounded by a variety of multidimensional issues which are: G Huge investments require finan- cial analysis to assess long-term profitability. G The long-term strategic benefits such as flexibility, improved qual- ity etc. and intangible benefits have to be quantified for the evalu- ation purposes. G Irreversibility of the decision making. G Greater financial risks in terms of future unforeseen costs. G Organizational risks in terms of unanticipated changes in the system. G Lack of information for making accurate estimates of future returns. G Cost patterns of new technologies are rarely understood, and the knowledge and expertise to make critical evaluations lies with only a few individuals within the organization. Selection and evaluation of AP is thus a complex process and requires analysis of a large number of issues. In this context, an attempt has been made to formulate a framework for converting the relative importance of such attributes into priority weights. A brief discussion on the literature, the formulation of framework and the application of the methodology are dealt with in the following sections. Literature review Datta et al.[3] and Demmel and Askin[5] have reported in the literature that selection and evaluation processes are highly dependent on a large number of attributes. Naik and Chakravarthy[6] reviewed selection and justification procedures and suggested a four-stage framework for the strategic acquisition of new manufacturing technologies. Park et al.[7] stated that the imple- mentation of automation technologies entails a large initial investment under a long-term, uncertain environment. They also observed that the decision to implement AP must be determined by expectations concerning factors of demand such as the breadth and the variety of products, the quality of demand, and also the quality of prod- ucts. Bessant and Hayward[8] and Boer and During[9] argued that the full benefits of AP are not realized for economic, technical, and organiza- tional reasons. It is observed from the literature that researchers have identified a large number of attributes and made varying attempts to classify them. For example, Tayyari and Kroll[10] have separated attributes into two categories: direct cost benefits, and intangible (hidden) benefits. Demmel and Askin[5] have identified a considerable number of implementation issues and placed these under three categories: strategic, tactical, and pecuniary (economic) issues. Wabalickis[11] has classified AP attributes into three categories: direct cost factors, strategic and tactical attributes. Young and Murray[12] discussed procedures for acquiring FMS. They have identified seven factors for the purpose: system quality; productivity; system reliability; system diagnostics; flexibility; material management; and economics. Mohanty[13] has consid- ered six types of attributes: strategic; technological; human; social; pre- production costs; and direct production cost factors. He has considered economic issues both in pre-production and production cost categories. Wabalickis[11] has consid- ered four attributes such as: inventory costs; sales; operating costs; and start- up costs and seven sub-attributes: lead-time; minimize inventory; prod- uct mix response; profitability; product change response; tooling; and scrap for evaluating three manufactur- ing systems using the analytic hierarchy Factors for evaluating factory automation projects inferences from an Indian survey K.V. Sambasivarao, S.G. Deshmukh and R.P. Mohanty WS July/August, 1995 17 process. Mohanty and Venkatraman[14] have adopted 12 attributes for selecting an automated manufacturing system. Datta et al.[3] have used 12 attributes for the justification of FMS. Demmel and Askin[5] have adopted 15 attributes for evaluating advanced manufacturing technologies. Sambasi- varao and Deshmukh[15] have adopted numerous attributes for the design and implementation of AP. They have also classified attributes into five categories: economic; human; social; strategic; and technological attributes. There is certainly no shortage of identification and classification of the attributes and issues affecting decisions about AP. Researchers have perceived the attributes with different names but the spirit behind the expres- sion is the same. For example, Mohanty[13] has considered hardware as plant and equipment, Troxler and Blank[16] have perceived market position as growth, and Datta et al.[3] have considered the financial position as investment and management information as the information system. A large number of attributes are identified from the literature and classified into five categories. The majority of authors have referred to these same attributes but with different expressions. These attributes are identified and listed in Table I. The attributes identified from the literature were reviewed by profes- sionals from both academia and indus- try in the present study. A framework is designed for converting the relative importance of attributes into priority weights. The implications of the frame- work are explained and are demon- strated in Indian industry, to derive the list of prioritized attributes; this is explained in the following section. Framework for converting attribute priorities into priority weights When a change in the existing manu- facturing system is proposed, a consen- sus idea may be sought. People in an organization may hold conflicting views about the best method of reach- ing any goal, and an understanding of these different perspectives is useful. Also, for successful implementation, it is useful to maintain a degree of partic- ipation from those who will be affected by the eventual decision. If a new man- ufacturing system is imposed from higher up, without the full knowledge and participation of all, it is almost sure to be unworkable. Huang and Sakurai[17] observe that, in Japan, the automation systems are designed and selected by their own technical staff. For successful adoption, a company needs the support of their appropriately trained employees to operate as well as design and select automated equip- ment. Employees are given due prefer- ence to participate in the automation process and the employees recognize the specific needs of the factory more than most outside consultants. The present study incorporates a four- stage framework which is devised to help obtain a consensus means of reach- ing a desired goal. The framework is devised for deriving corporate goals and evolving a list of prioritized objectives. (1) A group of people who participate in the decision making must be identified and called for a consen- sus confrontation. (2) The group will (again) meet and identify the goals or objectives of the proposal. The objectives or attributes may be identified from reading expert views, practical experience, individual opinions, and consultation with practition- ers. A list of consensus attributes are generated in the meeting. (3) The group is asked to rate the attri- butes on an appropriate (n-point) scale. Generally, the automation factors are difficult to quantify. However, their relative importance is converted into priority weights using an appropriate scale. (4) Responses for each attribute are tested using t-test for acceptable data.

Step 3 is repeated for accept- able data. Finally, acceptable data for all attributes are obtained. The framework is illustrated in Figure 1. The application of the framework in Indian industry is explained in the following sections. An Indian survey The context of the survey was a plan to identify the potential attributes relating to Indian manufacturing industry and to use the framework to obtain a list of prioritized attributes. Thirty-seven attributes were identified for the purpose. First, an open-ended list of attributes was identified from the literature. Then, the list of attributes was categorized into five sections: economic; human; social; strategic; and technological factors in consultation and discussion with professionals. The purpose of the survey was to: G identify potential attributes for selection and evaluation of AP; G develop a methodology for con- vening attribute priorities into priority weights; G examine the relative importance of attributes; G list and rank the prioritized attri- butes; and G draw the attention of industry to the importance of AF. Details of the survey Primary data for the study were col- lected from various industry profes- sionals and academics through a self- addressed mail questionnaire. Prior to administering the questionnaire, the survey instrument was reviewed by members of the target audience three academics and two industry profes- sionals. The results of their inputs were used to ensure clarity and complete- ness, and to eliminate any ambiguities. A copy of the final version of the questionnaire was mailed to 125 pro- fessionals. The professionals were from across the country and all are currently involved in automation projects. The sample included automobile and auto parts, CNC machine tools and allied manufacturers, electrical and electron- ics equipment, R&D, academics, turnkey and developmental projects. Thirty-two respondents replied, repre- senting a 25 per cent response rate. Apart from collecting responses to the basic questions, a few open-ended responses were also obtained. Table II summarizes the characteris- tics and profile of the respondents and their organizations. A simple, seven- point scale was devised to rate each attribute. The scale is given in Table III. Professionals were requested to indicate the priorities for the attributes listed. The responses were gathered and analysed. The suitability of the responses was tested using t-test. If the t value did not fall in the critical region, the respondent was informed and asked to modify the priority (if he/she was willing and able to do so). Finally, all valid responses were analysed as follows. Analysis of data The sample of inputs consisted of the responses from five types of industry. Responses were processed on an individual sector basis as well as at an aggregate level.

The average of the highest and lowest priorities of an attribute is treated as the theoretical mean. The validity of the samples was tested using t-test. The standard deviation for each attribute was also calculated. To test the responses, the sample mean and standard deviation were calculated. The mean and standard deviation of various attributes are listed in Table IV (for all responses). The calculation procedure for the attribute Finance position is illustrated in Figure 2. Hypothesis testing The hypothesis for a given attribute is tested for acceptable responses. The sample is tested at a specified level of confidence using t-test. For example, the ongoing responses are tested at a 95 per cent confidence level. The relation is expressed as: t = (M )* n/ (for v d.o.f.) (1) where = sample mean M = theoretical mean n = sample size (number of responses) = standard deviation v = (n 1) d.o.f. = significance level. Based on the t values, the significance of mean difference (theoretical mean and PW) was tested. Figure 3 gives the procedure adopted for one such attri- bute. Following the adoption of a similar procedure for the other attri- butes, the t values and PW shown in Table IV were obtained. In the current study acceptable data for all attributes were obtained. For example, the input sample for the attribute Finance position at the 95 per cent confidence level was acceptable. Hence, we could accept the PW. This indicates that corporate goals are often set to improve the finance Priority score Explanation 7 Very important 6 Important 5 Essential 4 Necessary 3 Considered 2 Less considered 1 Least advised Table III.

Priority weights of attributes of sampled composite industry 20 Work Study position. Similar observations can be made regarding the other attributes. Implications of the study: some observations The responses were processed sector- wise. Table V shows the listing of pri- ority weights of attributes on a sector basis. The ranking of each attribute is shown based on the highest PW. Table IV shows the composite results of all responses. From the study, it was observed that quality, finance position, management development, throughput, technology position, flexibility, technical feasi- bility, etc. were given the greatest prominence (and achieved the highest PW). Human factors, community development, and ecology achieved the lowest PW and are obviously of low priority to most decision makers. From Table V, it can be seen that all types of industry give the highest priority to quality and the lowest to ecology but also that different industries have different priorities. Using the above study, AP can be ap- praised for their investment justifica- tion, for which many analytical justifi- cation approaches are adopted. Naik and Chakravarthy[6] and Meredith and Suresh[2] have reviewed and explained various justification approaches. These include: scoring models, multi-attribute decision models such as the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), the linear additive model, and the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS). Apart from the SI, a few open-ended responses were obtained. Respondents made observations on common diffi- culties in adapting to automated manu- facturing systems such as: G lack of technical skills; G managerial problems; G lack of confidence to implement automated systems; G absence of clear-cut policy direc- tion towards automation; G poorly understood evaluation methods; and G strong resistance to adopting automation. Concluding remarks Technological change is dynamic. In a competitive environment, manufactur- ing firms are struggling to implement AP successfully. In this context, an attempt has been made to evolve a framework which converts attribute priorities into priority weights. A survey has been conducted to study the relative importance of various attri- butes. The study was intended to sug- gest some potential attributes for judging the implementation of AP. This framework may be used for identi- fication of corporate goals, the selec- tion of automation criteria and for deriving goal priorities. The usefulness of this methodology can be summar- ized as follows. Economy In the national economy, the automated manufacturing sector occupies a very significant position. The government of India has liberalized its economy and is aiming to achieve success in Hypothesis: H0 = Assumption = The input sample is reliable and acceptable at 95% of confidence level H1 Assumption = The input sample is not reliable and not acceptable Critical region: t /2 < t < t /2 for v = 31, = 0.05, 1.749 < t < 1.749 Procedure: Calculate the value of t t = (M ) * n (for v degrees of freedom) = 1.493 Conclusion: Accept the null hypothesis which assumes that sample is acceptable at 95% level of confidence Figure 3.

Priority weights of attributes sector-wise WS July/August, 1995 21 global markets. Manufacturing indus- tries are faced with heavy market pres- sures both from home and abroad. Responding to these pressures needs flexible manufacturing technologies which can quickly respond to market changes and attack niche markets where they can be identified. The need for automation in a growing economy like India is well acknowledged. The present study is meant to help in promoting and addressing automation issues and implications. Industry The study provides a basic framework within which various attributes can be evaluated to assess the degree to which they meet objectives for successful implementation at an individual indus- try level and at a micro level. A list of prioritized attributes was obtained from the survey. This may draw the attention of manufacturers to those factors which are generally considered important when evaluating automation projects and which they should themselves evaluate. Academics Industry, perhaps not surprisingly, values hard economic and quality- related factors and not softer people- related factors. There is perhaps a need for further education and promotion of the relationships between these two sets of factors. References 1.
