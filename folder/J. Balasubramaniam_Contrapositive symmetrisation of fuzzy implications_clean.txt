Balasubramaniam Department of Mathematics and Computer Sciences, Sri Sathya Sai Institute of Higher Learning, Prasanthi Nilayam, AP 515134, India Received 1 April 2005; received in revised form 9 March 2006; accepted 13 March 2006 Available online 7 April 2006 Abstract Contrapositive symmetry (CPS) is a tautology in classical logic. In fuzzy logic, not all fuzzy implications have CPS with respect to a given strong negation. Given a fuzzy implication J, towards imparting contrapositive symmetry to J with respect to a strong negation N two techniques, viz., upper and lower contrapositivisation, have been proposed by Bandler and Kohout [Semantics of implication operators and fuzzy relational products, Internat. J. Man Machine Stud. 12 (1980) 89 116]. In this work we investigate the N-compatibility of these contrapositivisation techniques, i.e., conditions under which the natural negation of the contrapositivised implication is equal to the strong negation employed. This property is equivalent to the neutrality of the contrapositivised implication. We have shown that while upper contrapositivisation has N-compatibility when the natural negation of the fuzzy implication J (given by NJ (x) = J(x, 0)) is less than the strong negation N considered, the lower contrapositivisation is N-compatible in the other case. Also we have proposed a new contrapositivisation technique, viz., M-contrapositivisation, which is N-compatible independent of the ordering on the negations. Some interesting properties of M-contrapositivisation are also discussed. Since all S-implications have contrapositive symmetry, we investigate whether these contrapositivisations can be written as S-implications for suitable fuzzy disjunctions. Also some suf cient conditions for these fuzzy disjunctions to become t-conorms are given. In line with Fodor s [Contrapositive symmetry of fuzzy implications, Fuzzy Sets and Systems 69 (1995) 141 156] investigation, it is shown that the lower contrapositivisation of an R-implication JT can also be seen as the residuation of a suitable binary operator. 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction In the framework of classical two-valued logic, contrapositivity of a binary implication operator is a tautology, i.e.,    . In fuzzy logic, contrapositive symmetry of a fuzzy implication J with respect to strong negation N CPS(N) plays an important role in the applications of fuzzy implications, viz., approximate reasoning, deductive systems, decision support systems, formal methods of proof, etc. (see also [7,10]). Usually, the contrapositive symmetry of a fuzzy implication J is studied with respect to its natural negation, denoted by NJ and de ned as NJ (x) = J(x, 0) for all x [0, 1], i.e., CPS(NJ ). However, not all fuzzy implications have CPS(NJ ), either because the natural negation NJ is not strong or NJ is strong but still J does not have CPS(NJ ). For example, consider the fuzzy implication JGG(x, y) = min{1, (1 x)/(1 y)}. The natural negation of JGG is NJGG(x) = 1 x which is a strong negation but JGG does not have CPS(1 x). Similarly the natural negation of the E-mail address: jbyes@rediffmail.com. 0165-0114/$ - see front matter 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 fuzzy implication J(x, y) = [1 x + x y2]1/2 is NJ (x) = J(x, 0) = [1 x]1/2 which is not a strong negation and hence J does not have CPS(NJ ). Towards imparting contrapositive symmetry to such fuzzy implications J with respect to a strong negation N the following two contrapositivisation techniques upper and lower contrapositivisation have been proposed in [2]: x U:N  y = max{J(x, y), J(N(y), N(x))}, x L:N  y = min{J(x, y), J(N(y), N(x))}, for any x, y [0, 1]. These techniques transform a fuzzy implication J that does not have CPS(NJ ) into a contraposi- tivised implication J :N  that has CPS(N) with respect to a strong negation N. Of particular interest is when N is taken as NJ , provided NJ is strong. In this work we investigate the conditions under which J has contrapositive symmetry with respect to its natural negation NJ , i.e., when will J have CPS(NJ )? In other words, we investigate the conditions under which NJ N. 1.1. Motivation for this work In [7] Fodor has discussed the contrapositive symmetry of fuzzy implications for the three main families, viz., S-, R- and QL-implications. Fodor has considered the upper contrapositivisation of the R-implication JT , with T a strict t-norm, and cites the lack of neutrality of the lower contrapositivisation of JT as one of the reasons for not considering it. In this work we investigate the conditions under which both the upper and lower contrapositivised fuzzy implications have the neutrality property when applied to a general fuzzy implication, by showing that it is equivalent to investigating the conditions under which the natural negations obtained from these, i.e., x U:N  0, x L:N  0, are equal to the strong negation N employed therein. When a contrapositivisation :N  has the property that its natural negation is equal to the strong negation N employed therein, we say :N  is N-compatible. 1.2. Outline of the paper After detailing the necessary preliminaries in Section 2, in Section 3 we investigate the conditions under which these two techniques, viz., U:N  , L:N  , are N-compatible. We show that an ordering between N and the natural negation NJ of the original implication J considered is necessary for U:N  , L:N  to be N-compatible. Also, in Section 4, we propose a new contrapositivisation technique M:N  such that the transformed implication not only has contrapositive symmetry with respect to N, but also is N-compatible independent of any ordering between N and NJ . It is well-known that S-implications have contrapositive symmetry with respect to the strong negation used in its de nition. Since all the three contrapositivisation techniques, viz, U:N  , L:N  , M:N  , in general, can be applied to any fuzzy implication, we investigate, in Section 5, whether they can be written as S-implications for suitable fuzzy disjunctions , , $, respectively. Subsequently, we propose some suf cient conditions for these fuzzy disjunctions to become t-conorms. In [7] Fodor has shown the upper contrapositivisation of an R-implication JT obtained from a (strict) t-norm T as the residuation of an appropriate conjunction, T , and discussed conditions under which it becomes a t-norm. In Section 6, an analogous study is done in the case of lower contrapositivisation. Finally, some concluding remarks are given. 2. Preliminaries To make this work self-contained, we brie y mention some of the concepts and results employed in the rest of the work. Author's personal copy J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 2293 2.1. Negations De nition 1 (Fodor and Roubens [8, De nition 1.1, p. 3]). A negation N is a function from [0, 1] to [0, 1] such that N(0) = 1; N(1) = 0; N is non-increasing. De nition 2. A negation N is said to be non-vanishing if N(x) = 0 for any x [0, 1), i.e., N(x) = 0 iff x = 1; non- lling if N(x) = 1 for any x (0, 1], i.e., N(x) = 1 iff x = 0. A negation N that is not non- lling (non-vanishing) will be called lling (vanishing). De nition 3 (Fodor and Roubens [8, De nition 1.2, p. 3]). A negation N is called strict if in addition N is strictly decreasing and continuous. Note that if a negation N is strict it is both non-vanishing and non- lling, but the converse is not true as shown in Fig. 1, which gives the graphs of some continuous lling and vanishing negations. De nition 4 (Fodor and Roubens [8, De nition 1.2, p. 3]). A strong negation N is a strict negation N that is also involutive, i.e., N(N(x)) = x, x [0, 1]. 2.2. t-norms and t-conorms De nition 5 (Klement et al. [11, De nition 1.1, p. 4]). A t-norm T is a function from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1] such that for all x, y, z [0, 1], T (x, y) = T (y, x), (T1) T (x, T (y, z)) = T (T (x, y), z), (T2) T (x, y) T (x, z) whenever y z, (T3) T (x, 1) = x. (T4) De nition 6 (Klement et al. [11, De nition 1.13 p. 11]). A t-conorm S is a function from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1] such that for all x, y, z [0, 1], S(x, y) = S(y, x), (S1) S(x, S(y, z)) = S(S(x, y), z), (S2) S(x, y) S(x, z) whenever y z, (S3) S(x, 0) = x. (S4) De nition 7 (Klement et al. [11, De nition 2.9, p. 26, De nition 2.13, p. 28]). A t-norm T is said to be continuous if it is continuous in both the arguments; Archimedean if for each (x, y) (0, 1)2 there is an n N with x(n) T < y, where x(n) T = T (x, . . . , x    n times ); Strict if T is continuous and strictly monotone, i.e., T (x, y) < T (x, z) whenever x > 0 and y < z; Nilpotent if T is continuous and if each x (0, 1) is such that x(n) T = 0 for some n N.

A function J : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a fuzzy impli- cation if it has the following properties, for all x, y, z [0, 1], J(x, z) J(y, z) if x y, (J1) J(x, y) J(x, z) if y z, (J2) J(0, z) = 1, (J3) J(x, 1) = 1, (J4) J(1, 0) = 0. (J5) De nition 9 (cf. Trillas and Valverde [14]). A fuzzy implication J is said to have contrapositive symmetry with respect to a strong negation N, CPS(N), if J(x, y) = J(N(y), N(x)), x, y [0, 1]; (CP) Author's personal copy J.

(EP) Table 1 lists a few fuzzy implications along with the properties they satisfy among (CP) (EP) (see [12]). De nition 10. Let J be any fuzzy implication. By the natural negation of J, denoted by NJ , we mean NJ (x) = J(x, 0), x [0, 1]. Clearly, NJ (0) = 1 and NJ (1) = 0. Also by the non-increasingness of J in its rst place NJ is a non-increasing function. Example 1. Let us consider the fuzzy implication JB given in [1, Example 17, p. 274]: JB(x, y) = min  max 1 2, min(1 x + y, 1) , 2 2x + 2y  . (1) The following are easy to see: x y JB(x, y) = 1 and thus JB has the ordering property (OP). The natural negation of JB is given by JB(x, 0) = NJB(x) = 1 x if 1 2 x 0, 1 2 if 3 4 x 1 2, 2(1 x) if 1 x 3 4. NJB though continuous is not strict (hence not strong) and thus JB does not have CPS(NJB) as per De nition 9. Note that NJB is both a non- lling and a non-vanishing negation. JB does not have the neutrality property (NP). For example, JB 1, 1 4  = 1 2. Lemma 1 (cf. Bustince et al. [3, Lemma 1, p. 214]). Let J be a fuzzy implication and N a strong negation. Then (i) if J has CPS(N) and is neutral (NP) then NJ (x) = N(x); (ii) if N(x) = NJ (x) and J has the exchange property (EP) then J has CPS(N) and is neutral (NP); (iii) if J has CPS(N), the exchange (EP) and ordering (OP) properties then NJ (x) = N(x). Author's personal copy 2296 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 Proof. (i) Let J have CPS(N) and be Neutral. Then NJ (x) = J(x, 0) = J(N(0), N(x)) [ J has CPS(N)] = J(1, N(x)) = N(x) [ J is neutral]. (ii) Let N(x) = NJ (x) and J have the exchange property. Then J(N(y), N(x)) = J(N(y), J(x, 0)) [by de nition of NJ ] = J(x, J(N(y), 0)) [J has (EP)] = J(x, N(N(y))) = J(x, y) [N is strong] and J(1, y) = J(N(y), 0) = N(N(y)) = y. (iii) By Lemma 1.3 in [8], if J satis es (OP) and (EP) then J satis es (NP). Now using (i) we have the result. Example 2. Consider the reciprocal Goguen implication JGG. Then, as can be seen from Table 1, NJGG(x) = JGG(x, 0) = 1 x, a strong negation, but JGG does not have either CPS(1 x) or (NP). Thus the reverse impli- cation of (i) in Lemma 1 does not always hold. Example 3. To see that the reverse implication of (ii) in Lemma 1 does not always hold, consider the upper contra- positivisation J G of Goguen s implication JG(see [7]): JG(x, y) = min  1, y x  , J G(x, y) = min  1, max y x , 1 x 1 y  . J G has CPS(1 x), (NP) (see Proposition 17 below) and NJG (x) = J G(x, 0) = 1 x, but not (EP). Example 4. Again from Example 2 and Table 1, we see that NJGG(x) = JGG(x, 0) = 1 x, a strong negation, but JGG does not have either (OP) or (EP). Thus the reverse implication of (iii) in Lemma 1 is not always true. From parts (i) and (ii) of Lemma 1 we have the following corollary: Corollary 11. Let J be a fuzzy implication that has CPS(N), where N is a strong negation. J is neutral if and only if NJ N. Lemma 2. Let J be a fuzzy implication and N a strong negation. Let us de ne a binary operation SJ on [0, 1] as follows: SJ (x, y) = J(N(x), y), for all x, y [0, 1]. (2) Then for all x, y [0, 1], we have (i) SJ (x, 1) = SJ (1, x) = 1; (ii) SJ is non-decreasing in both the variables. In addition, if J has CPS(N), then (iii) SJ is commutative; (iv) SJ (x, 0) = SJ (0, x) = x if and only if J is neutral (NP); (v) SJ is associative if and only if J has the exchange property (EP). Proof. (i) SJ (x, 1) = J(N(x), 1) = 1, by the boundary condition on J. Also, SJ (1, x) = J(N(1), x) = J(0, x) = 1 again by the boundary condition of J. Author's personal copy J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 2297 (ii) That SJ is non-decreasing in both the variables is a direct consequence of the non-increasingness (non- decreasingness) of J in the rst (second) variable. Let J have CPS(N). (iii) Then SJ (x, y) = J(N(x), y) = J(N(y), N(N(x))) = J(N(y), x) = SJ (y, x). (iv) If J is neutral, then SJ (x, 0) = SJ (0, x) = J(N(0), x) = J(1, x) = x. On the other hand, J(1, x) = SJ (N(1), x) = SJ (0, x) = x, for all x [0, 1]. (v) Let J have the exchange principle. Then SJ (x, SJ (y, z)) = J(N(x), J(N(y), z)) = J(N(x), J(N(z), y)) [ J has CPS(N) ] = J(N(z), J(N(x), y)) [ J has exchange principle ] = J(N[J(N(x), y)], z) = J(N[SJ (x, y)], z) = SJ (SJ (x, y), z). On the other hand, if SJ is associative, then J(x, J(y, z)) = SJ (N(x), SJ (N(y), z)) [by de nition ] = SJ (SJ (N(x), N(y)), z)) [ SJ is associative ] = SJ (SJ (N(y), N(x)), z)) [ SJ is commutative ] = SJ (N(y), SJ (N(x), z)) = J(y, J(x, z)). The following are the two important classes of fuzzy implications well-established in the literature: De nition 12 ([8, De nition 1.16, p. 24]). An S-implication JS,N is obtained from a t-conorm S and a strong negation N as follows: JS,N(a, b) = S(N(a), b), a, b [0, 1]. (3) De nition 13 (Fodor and Roubens [8, De nition 1.16, p. 24]). An R-implication JT is obtained from a t-norm T as its residuation as follows: JT (a, b) = Sup{x [0, 1] : T (a, x) b}, a, b [0, 1]. (4) Remark 14. Though an S-implication can be de ned for any negation N, not necessarily strong, herein we employ the above restrictedde nitionfrom[8].Likewise,thoughanR-implicationcanbede nedforanyt-normT ithassomeimportant properties, like the residuation principle, only if T is a left-continuous t-norm. JT is also called the residuum of T . All S-implications JS,N possess CPS(NJ ), with respect to their natural negation NJ which is also the strong negation N used in its de nition (see Corollary 11 above), (NP) and (EP). All R-implications JT possess properties (NP) and (EP)(see [14]). If the R-implication JT is obtained from a nilpotent t-norm T , its natural negation NJT (x) = JT (x, 0) is a strong negation (see [7, Corollary 2, p. 145]). Also, from [10, Corollary 2, p. 162], and by the characterisation of nilpotent t-norms [11, Corollary 5.7, p. 125 126], we have that an R-implication JT obtained from a nilpotent t-norm T has CPS(JT (x, 0)). On the other hand, if the R-implication JT is obtained from a strict t-norm T then, by de nition, NJT (x) = 0, x (0, 1] and NJT (x) = 1 if x = 0, which is neither strict nor continuous and hence is not strong. Thus, JT does not have contrapositive symmetry with respect to its natural negation, in the sense of De nition 9. Author's personal copy 2298 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 The following theorems characterise S- and R-implications: Theorem 1 (Fodor and Roubens [8, Theorem 1.13, p. 24]). A fuzzy implication J is an S-implication for an appropriate t-conorm S and a strong negation N if and only if J has CPS(N), the exchange property (EP) and is neutral (NP). Theorem 2 (Fodor and Roubens [8, Theorem 1.14, p. 25]). A function J from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1] is an R-implication based on a left-continuous t-norm T if and only if J is non-decreasing in the second variable (J2), has the ordering property (OP), exchange property (EP) and J(x, .) is right-continuous for any x [0, 1]. 3. Upper and lower contrapositivisations Bandler and Kohout, in [2], have proposed two techniques, viz., upper and lower contrapositivisation, towards imparting contrapositive symmetry to a fuzzy implication J with respect to a strong negation N, whose de nitions we give below. De nition 15. Let J be any fuzzy implication and N a strong negation. The upper and lower contrapositivisations of J with respect to N, denoted herein as U:N  and L:N  , respectively, are de ned as follows: x U:N  y = max{J(x, y), J(N(y), N(x))}, (5) x L:N  y = min{J(x, y), J(N(y), N(x))} (6) for any x, y [0, 1]. As can be seen, U:N  and L:N  are both fuzzy implications, as per De nition 8, and always have the contrapositive symmetry with respect to the strong negation N employed in their de nitions. In [7], Fodor has dealt with the contrapositive symmetry of residuated implications JT obtained from strict t-norms T . When N is a strong negation, Fodor in [7] discusses the upper contrapositivisation of JT , denoted by T , as given in (5) and cites the lack of neutrality of the lower contrapositivisation of JT as one of the reasons for not considering it. We show in Example 5 below that upper contrapositivisation also suffers from the same malady.Also from Corollary 11 we have that the natural negation of U:N  is not equal to the strong N employed. Example 5. Consider the fuzzy implication J(x, y) = [1 x + x y2]1/2 with natural negation NJ (x) = J(x, 0) = [1 x]1/2 which is not a strong negation. To see this let x = 0.75. Then NJ (0.75) = 1 x = 0.25 = 0.5, NJ (NJ (0.75)) = NJ (0.75 = 0.5 = 0.707 = 0.75 = x. Thus J does not have CPS( 1 x). Note also that J is neutral, i.e., J(1, y) = [y2]1/2 = y, for all y [0, 1]. Let us consider the strong negation N(x) = 1 x. The upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is given by J (x, y) = x U:N  y = max{J(x, y), J(N(y), N(x))} = J (N(y), N(x)). Let y = 0.5, then J (1, 0.5) = max{J(1, 0.5), J(0.5, 0)} = max{0.5, NJ (0.5)} = 1 0.5 = 0.707 = 0.5 = y. Thus the upper contrapositivised J is not neutral and hence from Corollary 11 its natural negation too is not equal to 1 x. De nition 16. Let J be a fuzzy implication and N a strong negation. A contrapositivisation technique :N  is said to be N-compatible if the contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, denoted as J (x, y) x :N  y, is such that the natural negation of J , J (., 0) = NJ (.) = N(.), the strong negation employed. Or, equivalently J is neutral. In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we investigate the conditions under which U:N  , L:N  applied to any general fuzzy implication are N-compatible, and show that an ordering on N and the natural negation NJ of the original implication J considered is both necessary and suf cient for U:N  , L:N  to be N-compatible.

Let J be a neutral fuzzy implication with natural negation J(x, 0) = NJ (x) and N a strong negation. The upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is N-compatible if and only if N(x) NJ (x), for all x [0, 1]. Proof. Let x [0, 1]. By de nition of U:N  we have U:N  is N-compatible iff N(x) = x U:N  0, iff N(x) = max{J(x, 0), J(1, N(x))}, iff N(x) = max(NJ (x), N(x)), iff N(x) NJ (x), for all x [0, 1]. Proposition 18. If J is a neutral fuzzy implication and N is a strong negation such that the natural negation J(x, 0) = NJ (x) N(x), x [0, 1], then the upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is such that (i) x U:N  0 = NJ (x), x [0, 1]; (ii) 1 U:N  y = NJ (N(y)), y [0, 1]. 3.2. The lower contrapositivisation and N-compatibility We present below the counterparts of Propositions 17 and 18 for lower contrapositivisation. Proposition 19. Let J be a neutral fuzzy implication with natural negation J(x, 0) = NJ (x) and N a strong negation. The lower contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is N-compatible if and only if N(x) NJ (x), for all x [0, 1]. Proof. Let x [0, 1]. By de nition of L:N  we have L:N  is N-compatible iff N(x) = x L:N  0, iff N(x) = min{J(x, 0), J(1, N(x))}, iff N(x) = min(NJ (x), N(x)), iff N(x) NJ (x), for all x [0, 1]. Proposition 20. If J is a neutral fuzzy implication and N a strong negation such that the natural negation J(x, 0) = NJ (x) N(x), x [0, 1], then the lower contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is such that (i) x L:N  0 = NJ (x), x [0, 1]; (ii) 1 L:N  y = NJ (N(y)), y [0, 1]. Corollary 21. Let J be a neutral fuzzy implication such that NJ is strong. Then both the upper and lower contrapositivi- sation of J with respect to NJ , U:NJ  , L:NJ  , are NJ -compatible. If J has CPS(NJ ), then J(x, y) = x U:NJ  y = x L:NJ  y, for all x, y [0, 1]. 3.3. Some new classes of fuzzy implications and contrapositivisation Let the upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to a strong N be N-compatible. Then from Proposition 17 we know N NJ . Since N is strong N(x) = 1 x = 0 and we have that for all x (0, 1], 1 > N(x) NJ (x) and NJ is a non- lling negation. In other words, if the natural negation of the fuzzy implication J is a lling negation we cannot nd any strong N with which the upper contrapositivisation of J becomes N-compatible. Similarly, if the natural negation of the fuzzy implication J is a vanishing negation we cannot nd any strong N with which the lower contrapositivisation of J becomes N-compatible. Author's personal copy 2300 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 As noted in Remark 14, when T is strict, the natural negation, NJT (x), of an R-implication JT obtained from T is such that NJT (x) = 0 for all x in (0, 1] and NJT (0) = 1 and hence NJT is a non- lling but a vanish- ing negation. Since any strong negation N NJT only the upper contrapositivisation is N-compatible, as cited by Fodor [7]. In Section 3.3.1, we present the recently proposed classes of fuzzy implications by Yager in [15] and another new class of fuzzy implications inspired by it and discuss their contrapositive symmetry. These classes of implications, denoted herein as Jf and Jh, do not fall under the established categorisations of R-, S- or QL-implications and thus are of interest in their own right. An application of the contrapositivisation techniques discussed above with respect to Jf and Jh highlights the general nature of these techniques and also motivates an alternate contrapositivisation technique as presented in Section 4. 3.3.1. Jf and Jh fuzzy implications and contrapositivisation De nition 22 (Yager [15, p. 196]). An f -generator is a function f : [0, 1] [0, ] that is a strictly decreasing and continuous function with f (1) = 0. Also we denote its pseudo-inverse by f ( 1), given by f ( 1)(x) =  f 1(x) if x [0, f (0)], 0 if x [f (0), ]. (7) De nition 23 (Yager [15, p. 197]). A function from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1] de ned by an f -generator as Jf (a, b) = f ( 1)(a f (b)), with the understanding that 0 = 0, is called an f -generated implication. It can easily be shown, as in [15, p. 197], that Jf is a fuzzy implication. Table 2 gives a few examples from the above class Jf (see [15, p. 198 200]). De nition 24. An h-generator is a function h : [0, 1] [0, 1], that is strictly decreasing and continuous, such that h(0) = 1. Let h( 1) be its pseudo-inverse given by h( 1)(x) =  h 1(x) if x [h(1), 1], 1 if x [0, h(1)]. (8) Lemma 3. Let Jh from [0, 1]2 to [0, 1] be de ned as Jh(x, y) =def h( 1)(x h(y)), x, y [0, 1]. (9) Jh is a fuzzy implication and called the h-generated implication. Proof. That Jh is a fuzzy implication can be seen from the following: Jh(1, 0) = h( 1)(1 h(0)) = h( 1)(1 1) = 0. Jh(0, 1) = h( 1)(0 h(1)) = h( 1)(0) = 1 = Jh(0, 0). Jh(1, 1) = h( 1)(1 h(1)) = h( 1)(h(1)) = 1, since h( 1) h is the identity on the range of h. a a a h(b) a h(b) h( 1)(a h(b)) h( 1)(a h(b)) Jh(a, b) Jh(a , b). Thus Jh is non-increasing in the rst variable. b b a h(b) a h(b ) h( 1)(a h(b)) h( 1)(a h(b )) Jh(a, b) Jh(a, b ). Thus Jh is non-decreasing in the second variable. Since 0 a h(1) h(1), a [0, 1], we have Jh(a, 1) = h( 1)(a h(1)) = 1, by de nition of h( 1). Jh(0, b) = h( 1)(0 h(b)) = h( 1)(0) = 1, b [0, 1]. Remark 25. If f is an f -generator such that f (0) = , then h(x) = exp{ f (1 x)} is a decreasing bijec- tion on the unit interval [0, 1] and thus can act as an h-generator. Table 3 gives a few examples from the above class Jh. Author's personal copy J.

Jf and Jh implications, CPS(NJ ) and contrapositivisation In the following, we consider the natural negations of the Jf and Jh implications and discuss their contrapositive symmetry with respect to their natural negations. 3.3.2.1. Jf and its natural negation The natural negation of Jf , given by NJ (x) = Jf (x, 0) = f ( 1)(x f (0)), is a negation by the decreasing nature of f . To discuss the properties of NJ , we consider the following two cases: Case I: f (0) < . If f (0) < then NJ (x) = Jf (x, 0) = f ( 1)(x f (0)), x (0, 1). Since f and thus f ( 1)( f 1) are strictly decreasing continuous functions, we have that NJ is a strict negation. NJ is not strong always (see Example 6 below). Example 6. Consider the f -generated implication JfY(x, y) = 1 x1/(1 y) obtained from Yager s class of f -generators f (x) = (1 x) with f (0) = 1 < (see Table 2). Now, if  = 0.5, i.e. 1/ = 2, then NJfY (x) = JfY(x, 0) = 1 x2 is a strict negation.That it is not strong can be seen by letting x = 0.5 in which case NJfY (NJfY (x)) = 1 [1 x2]2 = 1 (1 0.25)2 = 0.4375 = 0.5 = x. On the other hand, if  = 1, then NJfY (x) = JfY(x, 0) = 1 x, which is a strong negation. Case II: f (0) = . In the case when f (0) = it is easy to see that NJ is not even strict, since x (0, 1], we have Jf (x, 0) = NJf (x) = f 1(x f (0)) = f 1(x ) = f 1( ) = 0, i.e., NJf (x) =  0 if x (0, 1], 1 if x = 0. Quite obviously, it is not strong either. Thus, as per De nition 9, Jf does not have contrapositive symmetry with respect to its natural negation. Now, in the case f (0) < , we have that the natural negation of Jf is at least strict and so both upper and lower contrapositivisation techniques are N-compatible, with respect to strong negations N, depending on whether N NJf or N NJf , respectively. On the other hand, when f (0) = , NJf is a non- lling but a vanishing negation and thus only the upper contrapositivisation technique is N-compatible with respect to strong negations N NJf . Author's personal copy 2302 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 Table 4 Examples of classes of implications J whose natural negations NJ are either non-vanishing (NV) or non- lling (NF) or both Jf /Jh : J(a, b) f (0)/h(1) NJ Type logs{1 + (s 1)1 a(sb 1)a} f (0) =  0 if x (0, 1] 1 if x = 0 Only NF 1 a1/(1 b) f (0) = 1 1 a1/ NF and NV [1 a + abp]1/p h(1) = 0 1 a1/p NF and NV min{[n na + abn]1/n, 1} h(1) = 1 1 n min{[n na]1n, 1} Only NV 3.3.2.2. Jh and its natural negation The natural negation of Jh, NJh(x) = Jh(x, 0) = h( 1)(x h(0)) = h( 1)(x), for all x [0, 1] is, in general, only a negation. But, NJh is a strict negation if h(1) = 0; NJh is a strong negation iff h = h 1, in which case NJh = h( 1) = h. Let h h 1. Then, if h(1) = 0 we have that the natural negation NJh is strict and so both upper and lower contrapositivisation techniques are N-compatible, with respect to any strong negation N, depending on whether N NJh or N NJh, respectively. On the other hand, if h(1) > 0 then NJh is a non-vanishing but a lling negation and only the lower contrapositivisation technique is N-compatible with respect to strong negations N NJh. Table 4 gives a few example classes of Jf and Jh implications whose natural negations are non-vanishing and/or non- lling. Thus whenever the natural negation NJ of an implication is either a non- lling or a non-vanishing negation (or both) one of the above contrapositivisation techniques is N-compatible with respect to some strong negations N. Now, let us consider a fuzzy implication J whose natural negation NJ is neither non- lling nor non-vanishing as given below. Consider the negation N (x) = 1 if x [0, ], f (x) if x [, ], 0 if x [, 1], where f (x) is any non-increasing function (possibly discontinuous), ,  (0, 1). For a t-conorm S, let us de ne J (x, y) = S(N (x), y) for x, y [0, 1]. J can easily be seen to be a fuzzy implication. Also the natural negation of J is N . Since N is neither non- lling nor non-vanishing, one cannot nd any strong negation N such that either N N or N N and thus both the upper and lower contrapositivisation techniques are not N-compatible. This motivates the search for a contrapositivisation technique that is independent of the ordering between N and NJ and be N-compatible. The following section explores this idea. 4. An alternate contrapositivisation technique As can be seen from Propositions 17 20, an ordering between the natural negation NJ = J(x, 0) and the strong negation N is essential for the resulting contrapositivised implication to be N-compatible, when we employ either L:N  or U:N  . In this section, we introduce a new contrapositivisation technique, denoted by M:N  , whose N-compatibility is independent of the ordering between N and NJ . For notational simplicity, we denote M:N  by M  in this section. 4.1. The M-contrapositivisation De nition 26. Let J be any fuzzy implication and N a strict negation. The M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, denoted herein as M  , is de ned as follows: x M  y = min{J(x, y) N(x), J(N(y), N(x)) y} (10) for any x, y [0, 1]. Author's personal copy J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 2303 Proposition 27. Let J be any fuzzy implication, N a strict negation and M  the M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to N. Then (i) M  is a fuzzy implication. (ii) If in addition, N is involutive, i.e., N is strong, then M  has CPS(N). Proof. (i) Since J is a fuzzy implication and N a strict negation we have the following: 1 M  0 = min{J(1, 0) N(1), J(N(0), N(1)) 0} = min{J(1, 0), J(1, 0)} = J(1, 0) = 0. 0 M  1 = min{J(0, 1) N(0), J(N(1), N(0)) 1} = min{1, 1} = 1. Similarly, 0 M  0 = 1 M  1 = 1. x M  1 = min{J(x, 1) N(x), J(N(1), N(x)) 1} = min{1, 1} = 1. 0 M  y = min{J(0, y) N(0), J(N(y), N(0)) y} = min{1, 1} = 1. Let x z. Then J(x, y) J(z, y) and since N(x) N(z) we have J[N(y), N(x)] J[N(y), N(z)], from which we obtain that x M  y = min{J(x, y) N(x), J(N(y), N(x)) y} min{J(z, y) N(z), J(N(y), N(z)) y} = z M  y. Similarly, it can be shown that x M  y x M  z whenever y z. Thus M  is a fuzzy implication. (ii) Let N be strong. That M  has CPS(N) can be seen from the following equalities: N(y) M  N(x) = min{J(N(y), N(x)) N(N(y)), J(x, y) N(x)} = min{J(N(y), N(x)) y, J(x, y) N(x)} = min{J(x, y) N(x), J(N(y), N(x)) y} = x M  y. Fig. 2 gives the plot of (a) the Baczynski Implication JB and (b) the plots of the different contrapositivisations applied on JB. Proposition 28. If J is a neutral fuzzy implication and N a strict negation then the M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is such that (i) x M  0 = N(x), x [0, 1]; (ii) 1 M  y = y, y [0, 1]. Proof. (i) By de nition of M  , for all x [0, 1], we have x M  0 = min{J(x, 0) N(x), J(1, N(x)) 0} [ by de nition ] = min{NJ (x) N(x), N(x)} [ J is neutral ] = min{NJ (x) N(x), N(x)} = [NJ (x) N(x)] N(x) = N(x). (ii) Again by de nition, for any y [0, 1], we have 1 M  y = min{J(1, y) N(1), J(N(y), 0) y} = min{y 0, NJ (N(y)) y} = y [NJ (N(y)) y] = y. Author's personal copy 2304 J.

If J is a neutral fuzzy implication and N a strong negation then the M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is N-compatible. Proposition 30. If J has the ordering property (OP) then so does the M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to a strict negation N. Author's personal copy J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 2305 Proof. If x y then by (OP) J(x, y) = 1. Also N(y) N(x) and J(N(y), N(x)) = 1. Now, x M  y = min{J(x, y) N(x), J(N(y), N(x)) y} [ by de nition ] = min{1 N(x), 1 y} [ J has (OP)] = min{1, 1} = 1. On the other hand, if x M  y = 1 then x M  y = 1 min{J(x, y) N(x), J(N(y), N(x)) y} = 1 J(x, y) N(x) = 1 and J(N(y), N(x)) y = 1. Now, if J(x, y) N(x) = 1 then either J(x, y) = 1 or N(x) = 1. Since J satis es (OP), J(x, y) = 1 x y. Also J(x, y) = 1 implies that J(N(y), N(x)) = 1. On the other hand, if N(x) = 1, since N is strict we have x = 0 in which case x y for all y [0, 1]. Similarly, if y = 1 then obviously x y for all x [0, 1]. Thus x M  y = 1 implies x y, i.e, M  has the ordering property (OP) if J does. Remark 31. (i) If J(x, y) y then it can be shown that x M  y y. (ii) If J is continuous, by the continuity of min and max we have that M  is also continuous. (iii) With regard to upper and lower contrapositivisation, when J has CPS(N) with respect to the strong N, we have that x L:N  y x U:N  y J(x, y), i.e., J J (see also Corollary 21).Whereas, in the case of M- contrapositivisation we have that x M  y = min{J(x, y) N(x), J(N(y), N(x)) y} = min{J(x, y) N(x), J(x, y) y} since J has CPS(N)] = J(x, y) [N(x) y] J(x, y). Thus even when J has CPS(N) the M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is a different implication and allows us to construct newer fuzzy implications that have CPS(N). Also the above process does not continue inde nitely. In fact, in the case when J has CPS(N) let J be the M- contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, i.e, J (x, y) = x MJ :N  y. Then the M-contrapositivisation of J with respect to the same N is (J ) (x, y) = (x MJ :N  y) (N(x) y) = [J(x, y) (N(x) y)] (N(x) y) = [J(x, y) (N(x) y)] J (x, y) i.e., (J ) = J . 5. Contrapositivisations as S-implications Since all S-implications JS,N possess CPS(NJ ), with respect to their natural negation NJ which is also the strong negation N used in its de nition and also since all the above contrapositivisation techniques can be applied to any general fuzzy implication, it is only appropriate that we study U:N  , L:N  and M  as S-implications for some fuzzy disjunctions , and , respectively. An investigation into this forms the rest of this section. 5.1. Upper contrapositivisation as an S-implication of a binary operator Taking cue from Lemma 2, given a fuzzy implication J and a negation N, we de ne a binary operator on [0, 1] as follows: x y = max{J(N(x), y), J(N(y), x)}. (11) Theorem 3. Let J be a neutral fuzzy implication and N a strong negation such that the natural negation J(x, 0) = NJ (x) N(x), x [0, 1]. Then the upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, U:N  , is such that (i) x U:N  y = N(x) y, x [0, 1]; Author's personal copy 2306 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 (ii) x 0 = x, x [0, 1]; (iii) x y = y x, x [0, 1]; (iv) is non-decreasing in both the variables. If, in addition, U:N  , has the exchange property (EP), then is a t-conorm. Proof. Since NJ (x) N(x), x [0, 1], and J is neutral, from Proposition 17 we know that U:N  is N-compatible. Thus U:N  has CPS(N) and from Corollary 11 it has (NP) and by Lemma 2 it follows that has the above four properties. If, in addition, U:N  has the exchange property (EP) then again by Lemma 2(v) it follows that is a t-conorm. Theorem 4. Let J be any fuzzy implication with natural negation NJ being involutive. If J(1, y) y, for all y [0, 1], and the upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to NJ , U:NJ  , has the exchange property (EP), then is a t-conorm. Proof. Let us consider the upper contrapositivisation of J with N NJ . Then obviously U:NJ  has CPS(N) and we also have that 1 U:NJ  y = max{J(1, y), J(NJ (y), 0)} = max{J(1, y), NJ (NJ (y)} = max{J(1, y), y} [ NJ is involutive ] = y [ J(1, y) y ]. Thus U:NJ  has CPS(N), (EP) and (NP) and by Lemma 2 it follows that is a t-conorm. Example 7. Consider the reciprocal Goguen s implication JGG (see Example 2 ). JGG(1, y) = 0, for all y [0, 1) and the natural negation of NJGG(x) = 1 x, a strong negation, but JGG does not have either CPS(1 x) or (EP). Also the upper contrapositivisation of JGG with N(x) = 1 x, as can be veri ed, does not have the exchange property (EP). From Theorems 3 and 4 we see the importance of satisfaction of (EP) by U:N  for to be a t-conorm. 5.2. Lower contrapositivisation as an S-implication of a binary operator Similarly, given a fuzzy implication J and a negation N, de ning a binary operator on [0, 1] as follows: x y = min{J(N(x), y), J(N(y), x)}. (12) we have the following counterparts of Theorems 3 and 4, which can be proven along similar lines. Theorem 5. Let J be a neutral fuzzy implication and N a strong negation such that the natural negation J(x, 0) = NJ (x) N(x), x [0, 1]. Then the lower contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is such that (i) x L:N  y = N(x) y, x [0, 1]; (ii) x 0 = x, x [0, 1]; (iii) x y = y x, x [0, 1]; (iv) is non-decreasing in both the variables. If, in addition, L:N  , has the exchange property (EP), then is a t-conorm. Theorem 6. Let J be any fuzzy implication with natural negation NJ being involutive. If J(1, y) y, for all y [0, 1] and the lower contrapositivisation of J with respect to NJ , L:NJ  , has the exchange property (EP), then is a t-conorm. Example 8. Consider the J(x, y) = 1 x(1 y)2. J(1, y) = 1 (1 y)2 = 2 y y, for all y [0, 1]. Since y [0, 1] we have that y y 2 y 2 y 2 y y y and hence J(1, y) y. Also the natural negation NJ (x) = 1 x is involutive, but J does not have either CPS(1 x) or (EP). Author's personal copy J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 2307 5.3. M-contrapositivisation as an S-implication of a binary operator Finally, given a fuzzy implication J and a negation N, de ning a binary operator on [0, 1] as follows: x y = min{J(N(x), y) x, J(N(y), x) y}. (13) We now have the following: Theorem 7. Let J be any neutral fuzzy implication such that the contrapositivisation of J with respect to a strong N, M:N  , has the exchange property (EP). Then is a t-conorm. 6. Contrapositivisation and the residuation principle A t-norm T and JT the R-implication obtained from T are said to have the residuation principle if they satisfy the following: T (x, y) z iff JT (x, z) y, x, y [0, 1]. (RP) It is important to note that (RP) is a characterising condition for a left-continuous t-norm T (see [8, p. 25], [9, Proposition 5.4.2]). 6.1. Upper contrapositivisation as a residuation of a binary operator Let T be a strict t-norm and JT the corresponding R-implication obtained from T such that they satisfy the residuation principle (RP). Fodor in [7] has de ned a binary operation T on [0, 1] by x T y = min{T (x, y), N(JT (y, N(x))}. (14) Fodor has shown that the upper contrapositivisation U:N  = T is the fuzzy implication generated by the residuation of T (see [7, Theorem 2(d), p. 146]), i.e., T and T satisfy the residuation principle (RP). The T operator is not a t-norm in general, and in [7] the following suf cient condition on T for T to be a t-norm is given. Theorem 8 (Fodor [7, Theorem 3, p. 147]). For a t-norm T and a strong negation N, if T (x, y) N[JT (y, N(x))] for y > N(x) then T is a t-norm and is given by x T y =  T (x, y) if y > N(x) 0 if y N(x). (15) T in addition to having very attractive properties has also opened up avenues for many subsequent research works. Also the nilpotent minimum proposed therein has led to some interesting research transformations of t-norms called N-annihilation in [10], characterisation of R0-implications in [5], study of generalisation of nilpotent minimum t-norms in [4]. It is only natural to ask whether the lower contrapositivisation of an R-implication JT can also be obtained as a residuation of a binary operator. Along the same lines of Fodor [7], in Section 6.2, we propose a suitable binary operation t such that the lower contrapositivisation of the R-implication JT has the residuation principle with respect to t. 6.2. Lower contrapositivisation as a residuation of a binary operator Taking cue from T of Fodor we de ne a binary operator t on [0, 1] as follows: x t y = max{T (x, y), N(JT (y, N(x)))}. (16) where JT is the corresponding R-implication obtained from the t-norm T . Now the following can be easily shown, along the lines of Theorem 2 in [7]: Author's personal copy 2308 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 Theorem 9. Let T be a left continuous t-norm, JT its corresponding R-implication, N is a strong negation such that N(x) NJT (x), for all x [0, 1], and operations L:N  and t are as de ned in (6) and (16). Then the following conditions are satis ed: (i) 1 t y = y t 1 = y; (ii) x t 0 = 0 t x = 0; (iii) t is non-decreasing in both the variables; (iv) x t z y x L:N  y z. Proof. (i) Since N(y) NJT (y), for all y [0, 1], we have N(N(y)) N(NJT (y)) and from which we obtain the following: 1 t y = max{T (1, y), N(JT [y, 0])} = max{y, N(NJT (y))} = max{N(N(y)), N(NJT (y))} = N(N(y)) = y. Similarly, y t 1 = max{T (y, 1), N(JT [1, N(y)])} = max{y, N(N(y))} = max{y, y} = y. (ii) As shown in (i) one can also show that x t 0 = 0 t x = 0. (iii) Obvious by noting that N is strictly decreasing and JT is non-increasing in the rst variable and non-decreasing in the second variable. (iv) Since T is left-continuous (T, JT ) satis es (RP). Consider rst the case when x L:N  y z which leads to the following two cases: Case 1: JT (x, y) JT (N(y), N(x)). Then x L:N  y = JT (N(y), N(x)) and we have x L:N  y z iff JT (N(y), N(x)) z, iff T (N(y), z) N(x) [ by (RP)], iff JT (z, N(x)) N(y), iff N[JT (z, N(x))] y. (17) Case 2: JT (x, y) JT (N(y), N(x)). Then x L:N  y = JT (x, y) and x L:N  y z iff JT (x, y) z T (x, z) y. (18) From (17) and (18) we see that x t z = max{T (x, z), N(JT (z, N(x)))} y. On the other hand, let x t z y. This implies by (16) that T (x, z) y and N[JT (z, N(x))] y. By (RP) T (x, z) y iff JT (x, y) z, (19) and we also have that N[JT (z, N(x))] y iff JT (z, N(x)) N(y), iff T (z, N(y)) N(x) [ (T, JT ) satisfy (RP)], iff T (N(y), z) N(x) [ T is commutative], iff JT (N(y), N(x)) z. (20) Author's personal copy J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 2309 Again, we have from (19) and (20) that x L:N  y z. Thus x t z y iff x L:N  y z. Given a left-continuous t-norm and a non-involutive negation n, in [4] the authors have studied the following binary operation on [0, 1]: x n y =  x y if y > n(x), 0 if y n(x). (21) Evidently, (21) is a generalisation of (15). The authors have proven that n has all the properties of a t-norm, except for associativity (see [4, Lemma 1, p. 287]). Moreover, left-continuity of implies that of n. If is the residuum of , the residuum n of n is given as follows: x n y =  1 if x y, n(x) (x y) if x > y. (22) For a characterisation, some examples and graphs of such negations see [4, pp. 285 286]. The authors have characterised continuous t-norms such that, given a (non-involutive) negation n, n de ned by (21) is a t-norm and the natural negation of the corresponding residuum n of n, de ned by (22), coincides with n, i.e., n(x) = x n 0. Let  denote the above class of (left-)continuous t-norms n. Now, for any T , the natural negation NJT of the corresponding R-implication JT is not a strong negation and thus JT does not have CPS(NJT ) as per De nition 9. If NJT is also a non-vanishing negation then given a strong negation N NJT , the lower contrapositivisation of JT is not only N-compatible but also has the residuation principle with respect to a binary operation t as de ned in (16). Again, t is not a t-norm in general. In the following we give a suf cient condition for t to be a t-norm: Theorem 10. For a t-norm T and a strong negation N, if whenever y > N(x), T (x, y) N[JT (y, N(x))], then t is a t-norm. In fact t T . Proof. By the de nition of an R-implication JT obtained from a t-norm T we have that x y JT (x, y) = 1. If y N(x) then JT (y, N(x)) = 1 and N[JT (y, N(x))] = 0. Now, x t y = max{T (x, y), N(JT (y, N(x)))} = T (x, y). If y > N(x) then by the hypothesis T (x, y) N[JT (y, N(x))] and hence x t y = T (x, y). Thus both when y N(x) and y > N(x), t T , a t-norm. Remark 32. Theorem 10 is not satisfactory as t T implies L:N  = JT , which in turn means that JT has CPS(N) and thus by the neutrality of JT we have that N NJT . An alternate suf cient condition for t to be a t-norm is worth exploring in the light of the importance T received in the literature. 7. Concluding remarks In this work we have investigated the N-compatibility of two contrapositivisation techniques proposed by Ban- dler and Kohout [2] towards imparting contrapositive symmetry to a given fuzzy implication, viz., upper and lower contrapositivisations. A contrapositivisation technique is said to be N-compatible if the natural negation of the contra- positivised fuzzy implication is equal to the strong negation N employed therein. This is equivalent to the neutrality of the contrapositivised implication. We have shown that given a strong negation N and a fuzzy implication J, the upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, U:N  , is N-compatible if and only if N NJ , where NJ is the natural negation of J. Such a strong N exists only if NJ is non- lling. Similarly, the lower contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, L:N  , is N-compatible if and only if N NJ . Such a strong N exists only if NJ is non-vanishing. Author's personal copy 2310 J. Balasubramaniam / Fuzzy Sets and Systems 157 (2006) 2291 2310 Also we have proposed a new contrapositivisation technique, called M- contrapositivisation, M  , whose N-compatibility is independent of the ordering between N and NJ and thus is applicable for any implication J and strong negation N. Some interesting properties of this new contrapositivisation technique are also discussed. Fodor [7] has shown that for a special case of J the upper contrapositivisation is a residuation of a binary operator. We have shown that the lower contrapositivisation can be seen as the residuation of a suitable binary operator. We have also proposed binary operators (fuzzy disjunctions) such that the lower, upper and M-contrapositivisation can be seen as S-implications obtained from them. Also some suf cient conditions for these fuzzy disjunctions to become t-conorms are given. It is interesting to note that the exchange principle of the contrapositivisations seems very much necessary for the disjunctions , and to become t-conorms. Thus it would be worthwhile to investigate when does U/L/M  have the exchange property (EP). Acknowledgement The author wishes to express his gratitude to Prof. C.
