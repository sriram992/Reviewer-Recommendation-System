Yager, On some new classes of implication operators and their role in approximate reasoning, Information Sciences 167 (2004) 193 216] has introduced a new class of fuzzy implications, denoted Jf, called the f-gen- erated implications and has discussed some of their desirable properties, such as neutrality, exchange principle, etc. In this work, we discuss the class of Jf implications with respect to three classical logic tautologies, viz., distributivity, law of importation and contrapositive symmetry. Necessary and su cient conditions under which Jf implications are distributive over t-norms and t-conorms and satisfy the law of importation with respect to a t-norm have been presented. Since the natural negations of Jf implications, given by N Jf x J f x; 0 , in general, are not strong, we give su cient conditions under which they become strong and possess contrapositive symmetry with respect to their natural negations. When the natural negations of Jf are not strong, we discuss the contrapositivisation of Jf. Along the lines of Jf implications, a new class of implications called h-generated implications, Jh, has been proposed and the interplay between these two types of implications has been discussed. Notably, it is shown that while the natural negations of Jf are non- lling those of Jh are non-vanishing, properties which determine the compatibility of a contrapositivisation technique.  2006 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction Fuzzy implication operators play an important role both in Approximate Reasoning and Fuzzy Control Theory. The most established and well-studied classes of fuzzy implications are R-, S- and QL-implications (see, for example, [15,16,19,25] for their de nitions and properties). Recently, Yager [31] has introduced a new class of implications, denoted Jf, called the f-generated implications which in general are di erent from 0020-0255/$ - see front matter  2006 Elsevier Inc.

Motivation for this work Lately there has been a spate of works that discusses and explores the validity of many classical logic tau- tologies in fuzzy logic, especially those that involve fuzzy implications. Three such classical logic tautologies involving fuzzy implications that have obtained maximum attention from researchers are those that deal with the distributivity of fuzzy implications over t-norms and t-conorms, the satisfaction of the law of importation with respect to a t-norm and contrapositive symmetry. Recently there has been a lot of discussion [7,12 14,22,26] centred around a paper by Combs and Andrews [11] where they attempt to exploit the equivalence p ^ q ! r  p ! r _ q ! r 1 towards eliminating combinatorial rule explosion in fuzzy systems. (1) is only one of four such equations as listed in [17], which deals with the distributivity of implication operators with respect to t-norms and t-con- orms, the rest of them being p _ q ! r  p ! r ^ q ! r ; 2 r ! s ^ t  r ! s ^ r ! t ; 3 r ! s _ t  r ! s _ r ! t : 4 In [26], Trillas and Alsina have investigated the conditions under which the following general form of (1), where p,q,r 2 [0,1] J T p; q ; r  S J p; r ; J q; r 5 holds for the classes of R-, S- and QL-implications, where T and S denote any t-norm and t-conorm respec- tively. The generalisations of Eqs. (2) (4) are as follows: J S p; q ; r  T J p; r ; J q; r ; 6 J r; T 1 s; t  T 2 J r; s ; J r; t ; 7 J r; S1 s; t  S2 J r; s ; J r; t ; 8 where p,q,r,s,t 2 [0,1]. Conditions under which Eqs. (6) (8) hold for R- and S-implications have appeared in [7]. Except for the case when J is an R-implication obtained from a strict t-norm T and S1 = S2 is a nilpotent t-conorm in (8), in all the other cases, if J is an R- or an S-implication, the t-norm T and the t-conorm S do get xed to TM(x,y) = min(x,y) and SM(x,y) = max(x,y), respectively. Also Eq. (7) has been discussed in [1,2] under the assumptions that T = T1 = T2 is a strict t-norm and the implication J is continuous except at (0,0). The above equations play an important role in lossless rule reduction in Fuzzy Rule Based Systems [5,6,24,29]. Thus it becomes both interesting and important to discuss the validity of these distributive equa- tions for a given fuzzy implication in the hope of obtaining t-norms T and t-conorms S other than TM and SM, respectively. We will see below that the family of f-generated implications has more solutions to (7) than an R- or an S-implication. On the other hand, for Yager s f-generated implication too the solution to (8) is not fully settled. Thus it is worthwhile to study the distributivity of Jf over t-norms and t-conorms. The equation (x ^ y) ! z  (x ! (y ! z)), known as the law of importation, is another desirable tautology in classical logic. The general form of the above equivalence is given by J T x; y ; z  J x; J y; z ; x; y; z 2 0; 1; where T is a t-norm and J a fuzzy implication. In A-implications de ned by Turksen et al. [28], the general form of the law of importation, with T as the product t-norm TP(x,y) = x y, was taken as one of the axioms. Baczyn ski [1] has studied the law of importation in conjunction with Eq. (7) and has given a characterisation. J. Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 931 Author's personal copy Bouchon-Meunier and Kreinovich [23] have characterised fuzzy implications that have the law of importation as one of the axioms along with Eq. (7). They have considered the minimum t-norm TM for T and claim that Mamdani s choice of implication min is not so strange after all . Ref. [8] discusses the validity of this tautology for R-, S- and QL-impli- cations and its possible applications in Approximate Reasoning are explored. Contrapositive symmetry is yet another classical tautology desirable for fuzzy implications. Contraposi- tive symmetry plays a signi cant role in classical logic structures wherein proof by contradiction is a com- monly employed method to validate conjectures. Works in [9,10,20] discuss ways of imparting contrapositive symmetry with respect to any arbitrary strong negation N. Also contrapositive symmetry of fuzzy implications has been studied in a functional equation framework in [2] along with the law of importation and Eq. (7). This work, where we discuss the class of Jf implications with respect to three classical logic tautologies, viz., distributivity over t-norms and t-conorms, law of importation and contrapositive symmetry, can be seen as part of the above e orts. Yager in [31] has done an extensive analysis of the impact of this new class of implications in Approximate Reasoning by introducing concepts like strictness of implications and sharpness of inference, among others. This work can also be seen as a continuation of the above study on the classical tautologies satis ed by Yager s f-generated implications that have an in uence in Approximate Reasoning. For more recent works on the role of fuzzy logic operators in computing with words see [27,32]. 1.2. Outline of this work Firstly, by discussing the four di erent general forms of distributive equations we show that the Yager s class of f-generated implications does have more solutions for one of them than that possessed by R-, S- or QL-implications. We also give necessary and su cient conditions under which the class of Jf implications sat- is es the law of importation. Following this, we give su cient conditions under which the natural negations of Jf implications are strong and the implications Jf possess contrapositive symmetry with respect to their natural negations. Since the natural negations of Jf implications, in general, are not strong we discuss the contrapositivisation of Jf implications using the techniques proposed in [10]. We have shown that, in general, only the upper con- trapositivisation is N-compatible with Jf. Finally, taking cue from the f-generated implications Jf, we also present a new class of implications, Jh, called h-generated implications and show that they have some very useful properties, viz., their natural nega- tions are non-vanishing, and hence the lower contrapositivisation is N-compatible with Jh. The paper is organised as follows. In Section 2, we recall the class of f-generated fuzzy implications Jf pro- posed by Yager in [31] and also some relevant results on t-norms and t-conorms. In Section 3, we investigate the distributivity of Jf over t-norms and t-conorms, while in Section 4, the law of importation with respect to a t-norm T is explored and in Section 5, the contrapositive symmetry of Jf implications is discussed. In Section 6, we present a new class of implications, Jh, called h-generated implications and discuss their properties vis-a -vis contrapositivisation. Section 7 gives some concluding remarks. 2. Preliminaries To make this work self-contained, we brie y mention some of the concepts and results employed in the rest of the work. 2.1. Negations De nition 1 [19, De nition 1.1, p. 3]. A negation N is a function from [0,1] to [0,1] such that N(0) = 1; N(1) = 0; N is non-increasing. 932 J. Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 Author's personal copy De nition 2. A negation N is said to be non-vanishing if N(x) 5 0 for any x 2 [0,1), i.e., N(x) = 0 i x = 1; non- lling if N(x) 5 1 for any x 2 (0,1], i.e., N(x) = 1 i x = 0. A negation N that is not non- lling (non-vanishing) will be called lling (vanishing). De nition 3 [19, De nition 1.2, p. 3]. A negation N is called strict if in addition N is strictly decreasing and continuous. Note that if a negation N is strict it is both non-vanishing and non- lling, but the converse is not true. De nition 4 [19, De nition 1.2, p. 3]. A strong negation N is a strict negation N that is also involutive, i.e., N(N(x)) = x, "x 2 [0,1]. 2.2. T-Norms and T-conorms De nition 5 [18, De nition 1.1, p. 4]. A function T from [0,1]2 ! [0,1] is called a triangular norm (shortly t-norm) if, for all x,y,z 2 [0,1], T x; y T y; x ; T1 T x; T y; z T T x; y ; z ; T2 T x; y 6 T x; z whenever y 6 z; T3 T x; 1 x: T4 De nition 6 [18, De nition 1.13, p. 11]. A function S:[0,1]2 ! [0,1] is called a triangular conorm (shortly t-conorm) if, for all x,y,z 2 [0,1], it satis es S x; y S y; x ; S1 S x; S y; z S S x; y ; z ; S2 S x; y 6 S x; z whenever y 6 z; S3 S x; 0 x: S4 De nition 7 [18, De nition 2.9, p. 26; De nition 2.13, p. 28]. A t-norm T (t-conorm S resp.) is said to be Continuous if it is continuous in both the arguments. Idempotent if T(x,x) = x (S(x,x) = x) for all x 2 [0,1]. Archimedean if T (S resp.) is such that for every x,y 2 (0,1] (x,y 2 [0,1) resp.) there is an n 2 N with x n T < y x n S > y . Strict if T (S resp.) is continuous and stricly monotone, i.e., T(x,y) < T(x,z) (S(x,y) < S(x,z)) whenever x > 0 (x < 1 resp.) and y < z. Nilpotent if T (S resp.) is continuous and if each x 2 (0,1) is such that x n T 0 x n S 1 for some n 2 N. Table 1 lists the basic t-norms and t-conorms along with their properties. Theorem 1 [18, Theorem 5.1, p. 122]. T is a continuous Archimedean t-norm iff T has a continuous additive generator, i.e., there exists a continuous, strictly decreasing function f:[0,1] ! [0,1] with f(1) = 0, which is uniquely determined upto a positive multiplicative constant, such that for all x,y 2 [0,1] J.

De nition 8 [18, De nition 3.39, p. 79]. A multiplicative generator of a t-conorm S is a strictly decreasing function /:[0,1] ! [0,1], which is left-continuous in 1 and satis es /(0) = 1, such that for all x,y 2 [0,1] we have S x; y / 1 / x  / y ; where /(1) is the pseudo-inverse of /. For more details on the pseudo-inverses of monotone functions see, for example, [18], Section 3.1. 2.3. Yager s class of implication operators De nition 9 [19, De nition 1.15, p. 22]. A function J from [0,1]2 to [0,1] is called a fuzzy implication if for all x,y,z 2 [0,1] it has the following properties: J x; z P J y; z if x 6 y; J1 J x; y 6 J x; z if y 6 z; J2 J 0; y 1; J3 J x; 1 1; J4 J 1; 0 0: J5 De nition 10 (cf. [25]). A fuzzy implication J is said to have the neutrality property or is said to be neutral if J 1; y y; y 2 0; 1; NP the exchange property if J x; J y; z J y; J x; z ; x; y; z 2 0; 1: EP De nition 11 [31, p. 196]. An f-generator is a function f:[0,1] ! [0,1] that is a strictly decreasing and con- tinuous function with f(1) = 0. Also we denote its pseudo-inverse by f (1) given by (10).

Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 Author's personal copy De nition 12 [31, p. 197]. A function from [0,1]2 to [0,1] de ned by an f-generator as J f x; y f 1 x  f y ; x; y 2 0; 1; with the understanding that 0 1 = 0, is called an f-generated implication. It can easily be shown, as in [31, p. 197], that Jf is a fuzzy implication. Remark 13. Note that since x 6 1 ) x f(y) 6 f(y) 6 f(0) we have Jf(x,y) = f (1)(x f(y)) = f1(x f(y)) for all x,y 2 [0,1]. Also as can be seen from Theorem 1 and as noted in [31], the f-generators can be used as additive generators for generating t-norms. The following properties of Jf have already been discussed by Yager (see [31, p. 197]): Neutrality: Jf(1,x) = f (1)(1 f(x)) = f (1)(f(x)) = x. Exchange principle: Jf (x,Jf(y,z)) = f (1)(x f (Jf(y,z))) = f (1)(x f(f (1)(y f(z)))) = f (1)(x y f(z)) = Jf(y,Jf(x,z)). Table 2 gives a few examples from the above class Jf (see [31, pp. 198 200]). 3. On the distributivity of f-generated implications Jf over t-norms and t-conorms In this section, we study the distributivity of the f-generated implications Jf over t-norms and t-conorms, by studying the conditions under which Jf implications satisfy Eqs. (5) (8). 3.1. On Eqs. (5) and (6) Theorem 2 (cf. [7, Theorems 5 and 6]). Any neutral fuzzy implication J that is one-to-one in the rst variable, when the second variable is in (0,1), reduces (i) (5) to (1) and satis es (1); (ii) (6) to (2) and satis es (2). Proposition 14 [7, Propositions 3 and 6]. Let J be a binary operator on [0,1]. Then the following are equi- valent: J is non-increasing in the rst variable; J satis es (1), i.e., (5) with T = TM and S = SM; J satis es (2), i.e., (6) with T = TM and S = SM. Lemma 1. Let Jf be an f-generated implication. Jf is one-to-one in the rst variable, while the second variable lies in (0,1). Proof. Let y 2 (0,1) be xed and let x1,x2 2 [0,1] such that Jf (x1,y) = Jf (x2,y). Now since f(y) 2 (0,1) we have Table 2 Examples of some Jf implications with their f-generators Name f(x) f(0) Jf(x,y) Yager lnx 1 yx Frank  ln sx1 s1   ; s > 0; s 6 1 1 logs{1 + (s  1)1x (sy  1)x} Trigonometric cos p 2  x   1 cos1 x  cos p 2  y     Yager s class (1  x)k; k > 0 1 1  x 1 k  1  y J.

Since Jf is neutral and one-to-one in the rst variable with the second variable in (0,1), by Theorem 2(i) we have that S = SM and T = TM. ((:) On the other hand, since Jf is a fuzzy implication it has (J1) and thus by Proposition 14 J satis es (5) with S = SM and T = TM. h Theorem 4. Let Jf be an f-generated implication. Then Jf satis es (6) if and only if S = SM and T = TM. Proof. Again by the one-to-oneness of Jf in the rst variable and Theorem 2(ii). h 3.2. On Eqs. (7) and (8) To discuss Eqs. (7) and (8) w.r.to Jf we consider two cases under each of them, viz., when f(0) = 1 and f(0) < 1. First we note that, since Jf is neutral, i.e., Jf (1,y) = y, "y 2 [0,1], we have that T1 = T2 = T in (7) and S1 = S2 = S in (8). Hence when Jf satis es (7) and (8) they reduce to (11) and (12), respectively J f r; T s; t  T J f r; s ; J f r; t ; 11 J f r; S s; t  S J f r; s ; J f r; t : 12 Proposition 15 [7, Propositions 9 and 12]. Let J be a binary operator on [0,1]. Then the following are equivalent: J is non-decreasing in the second variable; J satis es (3), i.e., (11) with T = TM; J satis es (4), i.e., (12) with S = SM. 3.2.1. On Eqs. (7) and (8) when f(0) = 1 In the following result we show that Jf implications obtained from f-generators, such that f(0) = 1, satisfy (11) for t-norms other than min. Theorem 5. Let Jf be obtained from an f-generator where f(0) = 1. Then Jf satis es the distributive law (11) if (i) T = TM, or (ii) T is the t-norm obtained using f as the additive generator, i.e., T(x,y) = f (1)(f(x) + f(y)). Proof (i) Since Jf is an implication operator, and thus has (J2), from Proposition 15 we see that Jf satis es (11) when T = TM. (ii) Let T be the t-norm obtained using f as the additive generator, i.e., T(x,y) = f (1)(f(x) + f(y)). Since f(0) = 1 we know that f (1) = f1, f  f1 = id and we have 936 J.

Along similar lines the same can be proven when J is a QL-implication too. As noted earlier, since (7) has an impor- tant role to play in rule reduction, from Theorem 5, we note that when J is an f-generated implication, there exist other choices for T than min, unlike in the case of R-, S- and QL-implications. Example 1 shows that if the t-norm T in (11) is such that its generator is di erent from the f-generator used to obtain Jf then (11) may not be satis ed. Example 1. Let f(x) = lnx, then f(0) = 1, Jf(x,y) = JY(x,y) = yx, the Yager s implication [30]. Considering f as an additive generator we get the product t-norm TP(x,y) = x y. Now, let T be the ukasiewicz t-norm TLK(x,y) = max(0,x + y  1). Now, letting r = s = t = 0.4, we have JY(r,s) = JY(r,t) = 0.40.4 = 0.693 while TLK(s,t) = max(0,0.4 + 0.4  1) = 0. Hence JY(r,TLK(s,t)) = 00.4 = 0 while TLK[JY(r,s),JY(r,t)] = TLK(0.693,0.693) = 0.386, i.e JY(r,TLK(s,t)) 5 TLK[JY(r,s),JY(r,t)], when r = s = t = 0.4. Again by (J2) and Proposition 15 we see that Jf satis es (12) when S = SM. From Example 2 it is reasonable to surmise that a result similar to Theorem 5 may not be possible. Example 2. Let f(x) = lnx, then f(0) = 1, Jf(x,y) = JY(x,y) = yx, the Yager s implication [30]. Considering f as an additive generator we get the product t-norm TP whose dual t-conorm with respect to 1  x is the strict Algebraic Sum t-conorm SP(x,y) = x + y  x y. Let us de ne an increasing continuous function /:[0,1] ! [0,1) from f(x) = lnx as follows: /(x) = exp{f(x)} = exp{lnx} = x. Now, considering / as an additive generator of a t-conorm, we get the nil- potent ukasiewicz t-conorm SLK(x,y) = min(x + y,1). From Table 3 it is clear that (12) does not hold when J is JY and S is either the ukasiewicz t-conorm SLK or the Algebraic Sum t-conorm SP with r = 0.3, s = t = 0.1. Hence, determining t-conorms S such that (12) holds when J = Jf is worthy of exploration in view of the importance of (12) in the eld of rule reduction. 3.2.2. On Eqs. (7) and (8) when f(0) < 1 Again by the neutrality of Jf it is enough to consider (11) and (12). Towards investigating (11) when f(0) < 1 we need the following modi ed versions of Theorems 7 and 8 in [7] and the lemma given below. Theorem 6 (cf. [7, Theorems 7 and 8]). Any neutral fuzzy implication J such that J( ,0) is onto reduces (7) to (3) and satis es (3), i.e., J satis es (7) only if T1 = T2 = TM; (8) to (4) and satis es (4), i.e., J satis es (8) only if S1 = S2 = SM.

To show that Jf( ,0) is onto we need to show that for every y 2 [0,1] there exists x 2 [0,1] such that Jf (x,0) = y. Let y 2 [0,1] be arbitrary. Then J f x; 0 y ) f 1 x  f 0 y ) x  f 0 f y ) x f y f 0 : Now 1 P y P 0 ) f(1) 6 f(y) 6 f(0) < 1 ) 1 P x P 0. Thus for any y 2 [0,1] there exists x f y f 0 such that Jf(x,0) = y and so Jf( ,0) is onto. h From Theorem 6 and Lemma 2 we have the following: Theorem 7. Let Jf be an f-generated implication with f(0) < 1. Then Jf satis es (7) if and only if T1 = T2 = TM. Proof. ():) Let Jf satisfy (7). Then T1 = T2 by the neutrality of Jf. Then by the ontoness of Jf ( ,0) and The- orem 6 we have that T1 = T2 = TM. ((:) On the other hand, if T1 = T2 = TM in (7), since Jf is a fuzzy implication and so has (J2) we have by Proposition 15 that Jf satis es (11). h Theorem 8. Let Jf be an f-generated implication with f(0) < 1. Then Jf satis es (8) if and only if S1 = S2 = SM. A summary of the above results is given in Table 5 in Section 7. 4. On the law of importation J(T(x,y),z) = J(x,J(y,z)) In this section we consider the following general form of law of importation: J T x; y ; z J x; J y; z ; x; y; z 2 0; 1; LI where T is a t-norm and J is a fuzzy implication.

Contrapositive symmetry of f-generated implications In the framework of classical two-valued logic, contrapositiviy of a binary implication operator is a tautol- ogy, i.e., a ) b  :b ) :a. In fuzzy logic, contrapositive symmetry of a fuzzy implication J with respect to strong negation N CP(N) plays an important role in the applications of fuzzy implications, viz., Approx- imate Reasoning, Deductive Systems, Decision Support Systems, Formal Methods of Proof, etc. (see also [20,21]). De nition 16. A fuzzy implication J is said to have contrapositive symmetry with respect to a strong negation N, denoted CP(N), if J x; y J N y ; N x ; x; y 2 0; 1: CP De nition 17. Let J be any fuzzy implication. The natural negation of J, denoted by NJ, is given by J(x,0) = NJ(x), "x 2 [0,1]. Clearly NJ(0) = 1 and NJ(1) = 0. Usually, the contrapositive symmetry of a fuzzy implication J is studied with respect to its natural negation, denoted CP(NJ), provided NJ is strong. Also in the setting of fuzzy logic, contrapositive symmetry is the cha- racterising property of strong fuzzy implications obtained from a t-conorm and a strong negation, which are de ned as follows: De nition 18 [19, De nition 1.16, p. 24]. An S-implication JS,N is obtained from a t-conorm S and a strong negation N as follows: J S;N x; y S N x ; y ; x; y 2 0; 1: 13 The following theorem characterises S-implications: Theorem 10 [19, Theorem 1.13, p. 24]. A fuzzy implication J is an S-implication for an appropriate t-conorm SJ and a strong negation N if and only if J has CP(N), the exchange property (EP) and is neutral (NP), where SJ(x,y) = J(N(x),y). In general, the natural negation NJ of J need not be strong. Even if NJ is strong J still may not have CP(NJ). For example, consider the fuzzy implication J K x; y 1  x x  y2 1 2. The natural negation of JK is N JK x J K x; 0 1  x 1 2 which is not a strong negation and hence JK does not have CP(N JK). On the other hand, though the natural negation of the implication J GG x; y min 1; 1x 1y n o , N JGG x 1  x, is a strong negation JGG does not have CP(1  x). In this section, we analyse the nature of the natural negations of Jf, N Jf , under di erent boundary condi- tions on the underlying generator f and give a su cient condition under which N Jf is strong and Jf has CP(N Jf ). 5.1. The family of Jf implications and CP(N) The natural negation of Jf, given by N Jf x J f x; 0 f 1 x  f 0 , is quite evidently a negation. To dis- cuss the nature of N Jf we consider the following two cases: Case I: f(0) < 1 If f(0) < 1 then N Jf x J f x; 0 f 1 x  f 0 , "x 2 (0,1). Since f and, thus, f1 are strictly decreasing continuous functions, we have that N Jf is a strict negation. For N Jf to be strong, we need that N Jf N Jf x x; 8x 2 0; 1, which is not the case always (see Example 3). Example 3. Consider the f-generated implication JfY x; y 1  x 1 k 1  y obtained from the Yager s class of f- generators f(x) = (1  x)k with f(0) = 1 < 1 (see Table 2). Now, if k = 0.5, i.e.1 k 2, then NJfY x JfY x; 0 1  x2 is a strict negation. That it is not strong can be seen by letting x = 0.5 in which case N JfY NJfY x 1  1  x22 1  1  0:25 2 0:4375 6 0:5 x. On the other hand, if k = 1, then NJfY x JfY x; 0 1  x, which is a strong negation. J. Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 939 Author's personal copy Case II: f(0) = 1 In the case when f(0) = 1 it is easy to see that N Jf is not even strict, since "x 2 (0,1], we have J f x; 0 N Jf x f 1 x  f 0 f 1 x  1 f 1 1 0. Quite obviously, it is not strong either. In fact, N Jf is a vanishing but a non- lling negation. Thus, as per De nition 16, Jf does not have contrapositive symmetry with respect to its natural negation. The following result gives a su cient condition under which this happens. Theorem 11. Let the f-generator be such that f(0) = 1 and f1 = f. Then the natural negation of Jf, N Jf , is a strong negation and Jf has CP N Jf . Proof. Let the f-generator be such that f(0) = 1 and f1 = f. Then the pseudo-inverse of f from (10) is given by f 1 x f 1 x if x 2 0 f 1 ; f 0 1; 0 if x 2 1; 1:  14 Now, the natural negation of Jf is given by J f x; 0 N Jf x f 1 x  f 0 f 1 x  1 f 1 x for any x 2 [0,1]. Since f is strictly decreasing so is N Jf . Also, N Jf N Jf x f 1  f 1 x f  f 1 x x, since f1 = f. Hence N Jf , is a strong negation. From the following string of equalities we note that Jf has CP N Jf : J f N Jf y ; N Jf x f 1 N Jf y  f N Jf x  f 1 f 1 y  f  f 1 x  f 1 f 1 y  x f 1 f y  x J f x; y :  Corollary 19. If N is any strong negation then JN has CP(N). Any strong N can be thought of as a decreasing bijection / on the unit interval [0,1] with / = /1 and hence is a multiplicative generator of a strict t-conorm. Also note that for a strong N, JN has CP(N), (EP) and (NP). Thus by Theorem 10 JN can be represented as an S-implication. Now, the t-conorm SJ obtained from JN according to Theorem 10 is SJ(x,y) = JN(N(x),y) = N[N(x) N(y)] = /1[/(x) /(y)], which by Def- inition 8 is nothing but the t-conorm obtained using / as the multiplicative generator. Hence, in the case f(0) = 1 and f1 = f we do not obtain any new fuzzy implications but only S-implications from a strict t-con- orm S and the strong negation NS which is also the multiplicative generator / of S. 5.2. Jf and contrapositivisation From the discussions in Section 5.1 we observe that the natural negations of Jf, in general, are not strong and thus, as per De nition 16, do not have contrapositive symmetry with respect to their natural negation. In fact, the natural negation N Jf of Jf is, in general, only a strict negation if f(0) < 1, while it is a vanishing and a non- lling negation if f(0) = 1. Towards imparting contrapositive symmetry to such fuzzy implications J with respect to a strong negation N the following two contrapositivisation techniques upper and lower contrapositivisation have been pro- posed by Bandler and Kohout in [10], whose de nitions we give below. De nition 20. Let J be any fuzzy implication and N a strong negation. The upper and lower contraposit- ivisations of J with respect to N, denoted herein as ) U:N and ) L:N , respectively, are de ned as follows: x ) U:N y maxfJ x; y ; J N y ; N x g; 15 x ) L:N y minfJ x; y ; J N y ; N x g 16 for any x,y 2 [0,1]. As can be seen, ) U:N and ) L:N are both fuzzy implications, as per De nition 9, and always have the contra- positive symmetry with respect to the strong negation N employed in their de nitions. 940 J. Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 Author's personal copy De nition 21. Let J be a fuzzy implication and N a strong negation. A contrapositivisation technique ) :N is said to be N-compatible if the contrapositivisation of J with respect to N, denoted as J x; y x ) :N y for all x,y 2 [0,1], is such that the natural negation of J*, given by NJ  J ; 0 , is equal to the strong negation N employed. De nition 21, in essence, is asking for J* to have CP(N J). The following result has been proven in [9]: Proposition 22. Let J be a neutral fuzzy implication with natural negation J(x,0) = NJ(x) and N a strong negation. (i) The upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is N-compatible if and only if N(x) P NJ(x), for all x 2 [0,1]. (ii) The lower contrapositivisation of J with respect to N is N-compatible if and only if N(x) 6 NJ(x), for all x 2 [0,1]. Proof. We give the proof of part (i) as that of part (ii) is similar. (i) Let x 2 [0,1]. By de nition of ) U:N we have ) U:N is N-Compatible iff N x x ) U:N 0 iff N x maxfJ x; 0 ; J 1; N x g iff N x max N J x ; N x iff N x P N J x ; for all x 2 0; 1:  If the upper contrapositivisation of J with respect to a strong N is N-compatible, then from Proposition 22 we know N P NJ. Since N is strong N(x) = 1 if and only if x = 0 and we have that for all x 2 (0,1], 1 > N(x) P NJ(x) and NJ is a non- lling negation. In other words, if the natural negation of the fuzzy implication J is a lling negation we cannot nd any strong N with which the upper contrapositivisation of J becomes N-compatible. Similarly, if the natural negation of the fuzzy implication J is a vanishing negation we cannot nd any strong N with which the lower contrapositivisation of J becomes N-compatible. Now, in the case f(0) < 1, we have that the natural negation of Jf is at least strict and so both upper and lower contrapositivisation techniques are N-compatible, with respect to strong negations N, depending on whether N P N Jf or N 6 N Jf , respectively. On the other hand, when f(0) = 1, N Jf is a non- lling but a van- ishing negation and thus we cannot have any strong negation N 6 N Jf . Therefore, only the upper contrapo- sitivisation technique is N-compatible with respect to strong negations N P N Jf . A summary of results in this section is given in Table 6 in Section 7. In the following section, taking cue from the Yager s f-generated implications, we propose a new class of h- generated implications, denoted Jh, where h is de ned on [0,1] to [0,1], unlike f which is from [0,1] to [0,1] and study its properties. We also show that one can obtain natural negations N Jh of h-generated implications that are non-vanishing and hence the lower contrapositivisation technique is N-compatible with respect to strong negations N 6 N Jh. 6. A new class of implications: h-generated implications Jh De nition 23. An h-generator is a function h:[0,1] ! [0,1], that is strictly decreasing and continuous such that h(0) = 1. Let h(1) be its pseudo-inverse given by h 1 x h1 x if x 2 h 1 ; 1 1 if x 2 0; h 1  ( 17 J. Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 941 Author's personal copy Lemma 3. Let the function Jh from [0,1] [0,1] to [0,1] be de ned as J h x; y def h 1 x  h y ; x; y 2 0; 1: 18 Jh is a fuzzy implication and called the h-generated implication. Proof. That Jh is a fuzzy implication can be seen from the following: Jh(1,0) = h(1)(1 h(0)) = h(1)(1 1) = 0. Jh(0,1) = h(1)(0 h(1)) = h(1)(0) = 1 = Jh(0,0). Jh(1,1) = h(1)(1 h(1)) = h(1)(h(1)) = 1, since h(1)  h = id. For any x,x0,y 2 [0,1] we have x 6 x0 ) x h(y) 6 x0 h(y) ) h(1)(x h(y)) P h(1)(x0 h(y)) ) Jh(x,y) P Jh(x0,y). Thus Jh is non-increasing in the rst variable. For any x,y,y0 2 [0,1] we have y 6 y0 ) x h(y) P x h(y0) ) h(1)(x h(y)) 6 h(1)(x h(y0)) ) Jh(x,y) 6 Jh(x,y0). Thus Jh is non-decreasing in the second variable. Since 0 6 x h(1) 6 h(1), "x 2 [0,1], we have Jh(x,1) = h(1)(x h(1)) = 1, by de nition of h(1). Jh(0,y) = h(1)(0 h(y)) = h(1)(0) = 1, for all y 2 [0,1]. h Without explicitly using the pseudo-inverse (18) can be written in the following form: J h x; y h1 max x  h y ; h 1 ; x; y 2 0; 1: 19 Also, Jh has the following desirable properties: Neutrality (NP): Jh(1,x) = h(1)(1 h(x)) = x, since h(1)  h = id. Exchange principle (EP): For every h-generator h and x,y,z 2 [0,1] we get J h x; J h y; z h 1 x  h J h y; z h1 max x  h h1 max y  h z ; h 1 ; h 1 h1 max x  max y  h z ; h 1 ; h 1 h1 max x  y  h z ; x  h 1 ; h 1 h1 max x  y  h z ; h 1 ; since x h(1) 6 h(1). Similarly we get that J h y; J h x; z h1 max y  x  h z ; h 1 : Thus Jh satis es the exchange principle. Table 4 gives a few examples from the above class Jh. 6.1. Jh and its natural negation N Jh The natural negation of Jh, N Jh x J h x; 0 h 1 x  h 0 h 1 x , for all x 2 [0,1] is, in general, only a negation. But, N Jh is a strict negation if h(1) = 0; N Jh is a strong negation i h = h1, in which case N Jh h 1 h. When h = h1 from Corollary 19 we see that Jh has CPS(N Jh). Let h 5 h1. Then, if h(1) = 0 we have that the natural negation N Jh is strict and hence is both a non-vanishing and non- lling negation. When h(1) > 0 then N Jh is a non-vanishing but a lling negation.

On the other hand, if h(1) > 0 then N Jh is a non-vanishing but a lling negation and only the lower contrapositivisation technique is N-compatible with respect to strong nega- tions N 6 N Jh.

Then let us de ne an ^h : 0; 1 ! 0; 1 as follows ^h x def expff 1  x g: 20 Then ^h is a strictly decreasing function on the unit interval [0,1], such that ^h 0 expff 1  0 g expff 1 g 1 since f(1) = 0. Now, if f(0) = 1 then ^h 1 0 while if f(0) < 1 then ^h 1 > 0. In either case, the ^h obtained as in (20) can act as an h-generator. Similarly, from an h-generator one can obtain an ^f -generator as follows: ^f x def  ln h 1  x : 21 While an f-generator can be seen as the additive generator of some continuous Archimedean t-norm T, an h- generator can be seen as the multiplicative generator of some continuous Archimedean t-conorm S. Thus (20) and (21) are how one obtains the multiplicative generator of the N  dual t-conorm S from the additive gen- erator of the t-norm T and viceversa (see [18], pp. 80 81), where N is the classical negation N(x) = 1  x. Also note that if the range of the f-generator is [0,1], i.e., f(0) = 1, then f itself can act as the h-generator and Jh = Jf and h(1) = 0. This equivalence can be readily seen in the case of Yager s class of generators from both Tables 2 and 4. On the other hand, we can still obtain the h-generator from f as in (20) (see Example 4). Example 4. Consider the f-generator given by f(x) = 1  x. Then f(1) = 0 and also f(0) = 1 and thus letting h = f we get that Jf = Jh(x,y) = 1  x + x y. On the other hand, by employing (20) we obtain the following: ^h x expff 1  x g expfxg; ^h 1 x  ln x if x 2 ^h 1 1 e ; ^h 0 1; 1 if x 2 0; ^h 1 ; ( J ^h x; y ^h 1 x  expfyg minf ln x  expfyg ; 1g minfy  ln x; 1g; N J^h x minf ln x; 1g; whereas Jf(x,y) = 1  x + x y and N Jf x 1  x. When h(1) 5 0 or f(0) 5 1, one cannot take f = h and by applying (21) and (20) one gets di erent ^f and ^h, respectively (see Example 5). Example 5. Consider the h-generator h x 1  x2 2. Then clearly h(1) = 0.5 5 0 and thus is not suitable to be employed as an f-generator directly. Also Jh x; y min 1; 2  2  x x  y2 p n o as can be seen from Table 4. On the other hand, using the transformation (21) we have the following: ^f x  ln h 1  x  ln 1  x2 2x 2  ln 1 2 1  x2 2x; ^f 1 0; ^f 0 ln 2; ^f 1 x 1  2 1  ex  1 2; x 2 0; ln 2 0; x 2 ln 2; 1 ( ) max 0; 1  2 1  ex  1 2 n o ; J ^f x; y max 0; 1  2  2 1 2 1  y2 2y x 1 2 ( ) ; N J ^f x max 0; 1  2  2 1 2 x 1 2 ( ) : Similarly, the f-generator f(x) = lnx is such that f(1) = 0 and f(0) 5 1 and thus h 5 f directly. But by using the transformation (20) we have ^h x 1  x and J ^h x; y 1  x x  y while Jf(x,y) = JY(x,y) = yx. 944 J. Balasubramaniam / Information Sciences 177 (2007) 930 946 Author's personal copy A more detailed study of f- and h-generated implications has been carried out in [3,4]. 7. Concluding remarks In this work we have studied the newly proposed Yager s class of f-generated fuzzy implications with respect to three classical tautologies, viz., distributivity over t-norms and t-conorms, law of importation and contrapositive symmetry. The results of the above investigation are given in Tables 5 and 6 for ready reference. We have also suggested some su cient conditions under which Jf implications possess contrapositive sym- metry with respect to their natural negation. Since the natural negations of Jf, in general, are not strong we resorted to the well-established contrapositivisation techniques, viz., upper and lower contrapositivisation [10]. We have shown that, in general, only the upper contrapositivisation is N-compatible with Jf and hence we have proposed a new class of fuzzy implications called h-generated implications, denoted Jh, along the lines of Jf, for which class the lower contrapositivisation is N-compatible. In this work both necessary and su cient conditions have been proposed for Jf to satisfy the considered tautologies (except in the case of (7), (8) and CP(N) when f(0) = 1, where it is only a su cient condition). Thus determining the necessary conditions so that Jf satis es these tautologies when f(0) = 1 is likely to be both interesting and important. Yager in [31] has done an extensive analysis of the impact of this new class of implications in Approximate Reasoning by introducing concepts like strictness of implications and sharpness of inference, among others. For more recent works on the role of fuzzy logic operators in computing with words see [27,32]. This work can be seen as a continuation of the above study on the classical tautologies satis ed by Yager s f-generated implications that have an in uence in Approximate Reasoning.
