The main motto is to allow the computers to learn automatically without human intercession or collaboration and adjust actions according to it. Fig.1 Basic ML Model Fig.1 shows the steps involved in ML process. ML Model consists mainly of four steps: environment, learning, repository and execute [1]. Environment means to acquire outside information. Quality of information affect directly on learning to understand whether easy or clutter. Learning means to get the knowledge from information and that knowledge is added to the repository which stores many general principles that guide the implementation activities. Thomas H. Davenport writes in the Wall Street Journal, Humans can typically create one or two good models a week (while) machine learning can create thousands of models a week"[2]. Machine Learning Techniques: Fig. 2 shows the Machine learning classification techniques is divided into following category [4, 5]: A. Supervised Learning, B. Unsupervised Learning, C. Reinforcement Learning. D. Semi-supervised Learning Fig.2. Machine learning Classification technique A. Supervised learning It recognizes a labelled data set and is divided into two types: classification and regression [3]. Supervised learning is widely used in different-different applications, like speech recognition, spam detection and object recognition [6]. Supervised learning, if applied with proper data, the error rate can be reduced tens to the minimum error rate bound [3]. Table 1 describes the tasks performed using supervised learning, the algorithms used for performing the tasks and application domains. Table1. Supervised Learning Details Category Tasks Algorithms Applications Examples Supervised Learning Classification Neural networks, decision tree, SVM Intrusion/fault/an omaly detection Regression Logistic regression, SVR, Gaussian process for regression Throughput prediction, channel parameter regression B. Unsupervised Learning Unsupervised Learning means we have a collection of unlabelled data, we wish to analysis and discover patterns within it. Unsupervised learning has two important examples; dimension reduction and clustering [7]. Classic clustering algorithms include k means, hierarchical clustering, spectrum clustering, fuzzy clustering and the Dirichlet process [3, 4]. Table 2 displays algorithms used to segment text topics, propose items and find data outliers. ENVIRONMENT LEARNING REPOSITORY EXECUTE 2019 IJRAR June 2019, Volume 6, Issue 2 www.ijrar.org (E-ISSN 2348-1269, P- ISSN 2349-5138) IJRAR1AWP026 International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews (IJRAR) www.ijrar.org 131 Table 2. Unsupervised Learning Details Category Tasks Algorithms Applications Examples Unsupervised learning Clustering k means, spectrum clustering Congestion control [5], hierarchical routing[5] Dimension reduction Manifold learning, local linear embedding(L LE), isometric mapping(ISO MAP) Data aggregation[5] C. Reinforcement Learning The algorithm learns by receiving feedback on the effect of modifying some parameters, e.g. the power and modulation [6]. In this machine is trained to take exact decisions based on the business requirement to maximize efficiency. It is used in gaming and navigation and in general, to address applications such as robotics, finance (investment decisions), inventory management, where the goal is to learn a policy, i.e., a mapping between states of the environment into actions to be performed, while directly interacting with the environment [6,7]. Table 3 shows the algorithm task and technique used in various applications. Table 3. Reinforcement Learning Details Category Tasks Algorithms Applications Examples Reinforcement learning Policy learning Q learning Resource management, routing D. Semi-supervised learning It is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. Self-training is the oldest form of semi-supervised learning [8]. Example of semi-supervised learning is recognizing a person's face on a webcam. It consists of the methods such as classification, regression, and prediction [5] semi-supervised learning techniques can be organized in four classes: i) methods based on generative models ii) methods based on the assumption that the decision boundary should lie in a low-density region iii) graph-based methods iv) two-step methods (first an unsupervised learning step to change the data representation or build a new kernel; then a supervised learning step based on the new representation or kernel) [6]. II. Application ML has various applications in diverse fields: Agriculture In India, agriculture has become an important source of economic development. The agriculture industries started exploring new methods to grow food production because of increasing population and changes in weather. This makes researchers find new well-organized and valuable technologies for high productivity. Agriculturalist can collect data by using precision agriculture. Precision agriculture is technology, which provides advanced techniques to improve farm output. By utilizing Precision agriculture it is possible to make economic growth in agriculture and it is also used in many applications like pest detection in plants, weed detection, yield production of crops and plant disease detection, etc. A farmer uses pesticides to control pest, prevent diseases and to increase crop yield. The diseases in the crop are creating a problem of low production and economic losses to farmers and agricultural industries. Therefore identification of disease and its severity based as become necessary. Table 4 shows different-different techniques are used detect the plant diseases and accuracy of each. Table 4.ML Classification Technique for Agriculture ML Classification Technique Culture No. of Diseases Result SVM Classifier Oil palm [10] 2 diseases 97% accuracy for Chimaera and 95% accuracy for Anthracnose disease. Potato [11] 2 diseases Accuracy 90%. Tea [12] 3 diseases Accuracy 93%. Soybean [13] 3 diseases Accuracy is approximately 90% ANN Classifier Pomegranate[14] 4 diseases Accuracy around 90% Groundnut [15] 4 diseases Accuracy 97.41%. KNN Classifier Cotton [16] 1 disease Accuracy 82.5% Fuzzy Classifier Wheat [17] 1 disease Disease detection accuracy 88% and recognition of disease type accuracy56% CNN Classifier 14 crops [18] 26 diseases Accuracy 99.35%. Soybean [19] 3 diseases Accuracy 99.32%. 25 plants [20] 58 diseases Accuracy 99.53% Healthcare Healthcare field facing more problems and it is becoming more expensive. Several ML techniques used to rectify them, ML techniques use for prediction of various diseases like thyroid disease, cardiovascular disease, heart disease, Hepatitis Disease, cancer disease, and diabetic disease. From the earlier study, identified that naive Bayes provides 86% of accuracy for the diagnosis of heart disease. SVM gives 96.40% of accuracy for the breast cancer diagnosis, and CART provides 79% of accuracy for a tasting of diabetic disease [4]. Table 5 display the various techniques to detect the particular disease with its accuracy, also mention the dataset collect from which place. 2019 IJRAR June 2019, Volume 6, Issue 2 www.ijrar.org (E-ISSN 2348-1269, P- ISSN 2349-5138) IJRAR1AWP026 International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews (IJRAR) www.ijrar.org 132 Table 5 .ML Classification Technique for Healthcare ML Technique used Disease Dataset Accuracy J48 Heart Disease [21] UCI 84.35% SVM 85.03% Na ve Bayes Heart Disease[22] Diabetic Research Institute in Chennai 86.41% Decision Tree Breast Cancer [23] Swami Vivekananda Diagnostic Centre Hospital 97% DT+SVM Breast Cancer [24] UCI Machine Learning Repository 91% SVM Thyroid Disease[25] UCI 98.62% SVM Diabetic Disease[26] UCI 78% Finance Machine learning and artificial intelligence in financial industry [28] holds a lot of scopes, these include credit unions, banks, credit card companies, insurance companies, accountancy companies, consumer finance companies, stock brokerages, investment funds, and individual fund managers. [27] Fig.3 shows ML techniques are used for the finance segments. Fig 3.Financial segments A. Diagnostic Analytics It is used for knowing the root cause of a phenomenon, such as a project success or a failure. Diagnostic analytics includes all forms of financial risk assessment. A practical implementation is a tool "Halo" by Pricewaterhouse Cooper. Halo works on accounting journals and ledgers [29]. Its ability to flag higher-risk transactions. This is not an online real-time solution since the effort is only to diagnose and point out the financial risks. Accounting is about old transaction records, and that is what a tool like a halo tries to extract information from a client's systems and discover to bring forth high-risk transactions with their patterns and trends. It also gives out information on process inefficiencies in the accounting process, like eliminating duplicate accounting journal entries, etc. This is useful for a large financial organization because of the high volume of transactions that happen during a particular period in various departments [27]. B. Predictive Analytics It is used to show the result of an event in the future, such as the success or failure of a financial transaction, financial budget overrun, or a budget slippage for an organization such as a bank or a company. There are different parameters in machine learning model code takes into account for analysis before deriving the conclusion. Purpose is to provide a sense to the top management direction that the financial side of the business. It does not solve the problem, but it merely tells or acts a warning signal of failure that deviates from the plan for future related to finances. After applying predictive analytics, we get lots of fields of finance that come into play, such as cost accountancy, managerial economics, and decision support systems. predictive costing reports are based on past cost accountancy data.it helps large financial businesses stay on track with their cost budgets and make sure the right flags are raised if the real cost is predicting to increase as a result of prediction by a machine learning model. In management accounting or economics, as it is known in the academic circles, the focus on what-if scenarios [27]. ML models based on past data and applying them based on principles of management accounting. C. Prescriptive Analytics The greatest value obtains by constructing the prediction model based on predictive analytics and is advised for future actions. it uses ML to build a future plan based on past failures in financial transactions in similar situations, such as failed financial transactions, and it gives out specific activities that need to carry out in order for the financial transaction to success. In the financial sector, it is now truly able to do course corrections even before the failures happen. The prescriptive part starts when there is an accurate prediction made; then the actions that need to take even before this happens come after that [27]. Education ML used in education have much focus lately For predicting student s performance, the widely used model is instance-based learning, Na ve Bayes, Decision Tree, Artificial Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, Classification Tree [30], and clustering. Various data used to analyse the student s performance, such as prelude of the earlier semester, pre- university, examination mark, and demographic attribute. Generalized Linear Model (GLM) is the extended framework of linear regression. The idea computing a hyperplane to cut the loss function [31]. Support vector machine is widely used for data mining and classification to predict membership of a data. It is based on the geometrical interpretation. The algorithm searches for optimal separating surface, such as hyperplane [32]. The decision tree is one of the most commonly used techniques in predicting student s performance. Data mining in education field known as Educational Data Mining (EDM). It happens because of the increase in educational resources and data that can be explored to learn how a student learned. Researchers also investigated the factors that influence learning outcomes [33] Table 6 show the accuracy result for the Generalized Linear (GL), Deep Learning (DL), and Decision Tree (DT) with runtime. 2019 IJRAR June 2019, Volume 6, Issue 2 www.ijrar.org (E-ISSN 2348-1269, P- ISSN 2349-5138) IJRAR1AWP026 International Journal of Research and Analytical Reviews (IJRAR) www.ijrar.org 133 Table 6. Experimental Accuracy Result for Education Security Using unauthorized APs in the company, government and military facilities, there is a high possibility of being subjected to different viruses and hacking attacks. It requires to detect unauthorized APs for the protection of information. Various methods of research are in progress, addressing various aspects of the issue [36]. Dataset was created using Round Trip Time (RTT) values. The data set organized to apply the machine learning algorithm to give the result, and then the results obtained are compared, to show which algorithm is more accurate [35]. Table 7 shows the various ML methods are used for security purpose with its accuracy. Table 7.
