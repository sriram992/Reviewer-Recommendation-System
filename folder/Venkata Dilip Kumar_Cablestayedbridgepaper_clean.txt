Comparison of Different Types of Pylon Shapes on Seismic Behaviour of Cable-Stayed Bridges Govardhan Polepally, Venkata Dilip Kumar Pasupuleti and Archanaa Dongre Abstract Cable-stayed bridges are the most exible bridges and getting popularity because of its economy for longer spans and aesthetics. This study focuses on the effect of the shape of the pylon on the seismic response of cable-stayed bridge. For this study, complete geometry, material properties, loads and boundary conditions of the Quincy Bayview Bridge are considered from the past published literature. The bridge span dimension and other parameters are kept constant, and the only shape of the pylon is varied viz. A type, H type, inverted Y shapes. The height of the pylon is kept constant for all the numerical models for comparison purposes. The 3D bridge model is modeled using SAP 2000 software and analyzed for three earthquake ground motions Bhuj 2001, Loma Prieta 1989 and El Centro earthquake 1940. The seismic response of bridge at various locations are considered and compared. The study shows that the shape of the pylon has got great in uence on the seismic behavior of cable-stayed bridge.

Polepally et al. still a concern to structural designers, maintenance and construction community. A few of the primary reasons for the increase of cable-stayed bridges all over the world are their structural ef ciency, aesthetic appeal, enhanced stiffness compared to suspension bridges, ease of construction, large spans and small size of substructures. Primarly it would be of highest advantage were a large cantilever is needed for a span of the bridge and that point suspension bridge would be uneconomical. There are different types of cable-stayed bridges built based on variations like side-spar cable-stayed bridge, cantilever spar cable-stayed bridge, multi-span cable-stayed bridge, extra dosed bridge and cable-stayed cradle-system bridge apart from four classes of rigging on cable-stayed bridges harp, mono, star and fan. The structural components of a cable-stayed system behave in the following manner: The stiffening girder transmits the load to the tower through cables, which are always in the tension. The stiffening girder is subjected to bending and axial loading. The tower transmits the load to the cable-stayed bridges; their form and con guration depend on the way individual wires are assembled. A strand is generally composed of seven-wires, helically formed around a center wire and its diameter ranges from 3 7 mm. As cables are the most important elements in cable-stayed bridges; they carry the load from the super structure to the tower and to the backstay cable anchorages. In addition to high tensile strength, they must also have high fatigue resistance and corrosion protection. This study mainly focuses on the dynamic analysis of different types of pylon shapes of cable-stayed bridge to understand the effect of span length. 2 Literature The concept of cable-stayed bridges was rst proposed in the seventeenth century [1], however, the modern cable-stayed bridge began with the Stralsund Bridge, which was completed in 1956 in Sweden with a main span length of 183 m [2]. Cable- stayed bridges, due to their large dimensions and exibility, usually experience long fundamental periods, aspect that makes the difference with respect to other structures, and of course, that affects their dynamic behavior. However, their exibility and dynamic characteristics depend on several parameters such as the main span length, stay system and their layout, support conditions and many other things [3]. And modal analysis results on cable-stayed bridges are discussed in many papers, with emphasis on the seismic behavior. First vibration modes show a very long period, in the order of several seconds, and they are fundamentally deck modes. They are followed by cable vibration modes, coupled with the deck. The tower modes are usually of higher-order, which can be coupled with the deck depending on the support conditions. Undoubtedly, the modes are very dif cult to separate when they are suf ciently coupled [4]. An exact analysis of natural frequencies and modal shapes on cable-stayed bridges is very important, not only for the study of the seismic response but also for wind action and traf c loads [5]. Shah et al., studied the seismic response of bridge considering different shapes of pylon and soil structure interaction [6]. Sarhang thesis mainly concentrated on comparison of three different types of Comparison of Different Types of Pylon 71 cable stayed bridges using structural optimization and found to be very useful in optimization of complete structure [7]. Similarly, linear and non-linear dynamic analysis of cable stayed bridges were also carried out to understand the dynamic behavior and for possible failure locations [8, 9]. 3 Modeling and Analysis Cable-stayed bridge can be divided into three primary categories, cables, pylons and bridge deck. The Quincy Bay view bridge consists of 56 cables in two planes along the bridge deck, twenty-eight of them are in main span and the rest of the cables are in the side spans. The total length of the bridge is 541.8 m, the main span is 285.8 m and the two side spans are 128.1 m respectively as shown in Fig. 1a. The bridge deck is made up of concrete with thickness of 0.230 m and the bridge deck consists of two steel composite girders with the total height of 3 m. Two H type pylons support the bridge deck and the cables. The height of the pylons from the piers is 79 m and pylon also consists of two struts, the upper strut and lower strut. The lower strut supports the bridge deck. The cable connections at the pylons are starting at top of the pylons Fig. 1 Schematic diagram of 3 different types of pylon shapes of cable-stayed bridge a A shape. b H shape. c Inverted Y shape 72 G.

The lower ends of the cables support the bridge deck and the upper end of the cables connects at the top of pylon with fan type and diameter of the cable is 0.146 m. Rest of models are same as Quincy Bay view bridge but only difference is pylon shape, reaming all are constant including material and geometrical properties. Complete schematic diagram of the mentioned cable-stayed bridges are shown in Fig. 1 with dimensions. As for the modeling and analysis of the bridges, a nite element based software SAP2000 [10] is used. Most of the studies have similar software for effective and faster computations. Material properties assigned for different components explained above are given in Table 1. The bridge is assumed to be a composite structure consisting steel and concrete as prescribed in the past literature. Detailed sections modeled in SAP2000 for pylon and deck are mention in the Fig. 1. Boundary conditions at the bottom of the pylons are considered to be xed and two edges of the bridge deck are considered to be simply supported. For modeling of cables, this study directly uses the cable element and their attachments to the pylon and deck are considered to be rigidly connected. 3.1 Case Studies As discussed earlier, in this study three distinct cases have been considered with varying pylon shapes without changing other parameters. 4 Modal Analysis Dynamics of any structure is governed by a simple equation of motion mention in the (Eq. 1), assuming the damping coef cient to be zero. MU + KU = F(t) = 0 (1) Comparison of Different Types of Pylon 73 Above basic equation would give mode shapes based on the degree of freedom. Modal analysis is also very important in understanding the boundary conditions and modeling accuracy by seeing the frequencies obtained. Modal analysis is carried for three scenarios to calculate the frequencies and time periods. The obtained mode shapes for A shape, H shape and inverted Y shape pylons are shown in the Figs. 2, 3 and 4 respectively. And comparative modal analysis results for three cases are given in Table 2, where, column 1 represents mode shape number, column 2, column 3 and column 4 represents time period in seconds of A shape, H shape and inverted Y shape pylons respectively.

In fact parametric studies are most needed for robust conclusions.

Dynamic linear analysis will give the basic idea in understanding the behavior of cable-stayed bridge under the action of wind or earthquake ground motions. This study mainly concentrated on understanding characteristic behavior using modal analysis and linear behavior is calculated using earthquake ground motions. Con- sideration of seismic effects in the design of any bridge is almost a mandatory step for long life of the structure. As long as all the components of the bridge are lower 76 G. Polepally et al. than the yield values, linear analysis is the most suitable analysis. Once the effects grow larger, geometric non-linear inclusion needs to be considered for large defor- mations and material non-linear to be considered for individual member failures. In this study P-Delta effect has been considered as the bridge can undergo very large deformations. The following analysis results for three cases have been presented to discuss the effect of each earthquake ground motion on the three scenarios. Obtained results have showed different behavior than what is expected logically. This study has also limited itself to the discussion based only on the maximum displacements. For example, obtained plots are divided into a and b . (a) Shows the time history response on top of the pylon in the x and y direction, whereas gure (b) shows the time history response at the mid of the deck in both the directions. 5.1 Behavior Due to Loma Prieta Earthquake Ground Motion Loma Prieta earthquake has occurred on the San Andreas Fault system and has generated peak acceleration of 0.65 g at the epicenter. This ground motion was applied to all the three case studies and obtained responses at the mid of the deck and top of the pylon are shown in the Fig. 6a, b, respectively and respective peak values at both mid of the deck and top of the pylon for three cases are presented in Table 3, where third, fourth column represent maximum responses at mid and fth, sixth column represents at the top of pylon.

This earthquake has not only dam- aged the traditional mud and masonry structures but also new reinforced concrete structures that were constructed questioning the durability of ongoing construc- tion practices. Figure 7 shows the responses of three different pylon shape bridges subjected to Bhuj earthquake ground motion and in Table 4, column 2, column 3 represents the peak values obtained at the mid of the deck and column 4, column 5 represents peak values obtained at the top of the deck.

Polepally et al. 5.3 Behavior Due to El Centro Earthquake Ground Motion El Centro earthquake was one of the devastating earthquakes in 1940 and affected the USA and Mexico. The north south component ground motion is considered and applied to all the three scenarios, obtained responses at the mid of the are shown in Fig. 8a and responses obtained at the top of the pylon are shown in Fig. 8b. Table 5 shows the peak responses obtained at the top of the pylon and Table 6 shows the peak values obtained at the mid of the deck.

So, largely numerical models play a vital role due to their ease in modeling, computations and faster parametric studies. In this study, the most important key design considerations for cable-stayed bridges under gravity loads and earthquake loads are discussed. The numerical model of a cable-stayed bridge is formulated for single plane of cables with global coordinates for bridges having three different pylon shapes. Different parameters are considered to get the in uence of the principal characteristics which are layout of the stays, the inertia of deck and pylons. Few key observations from this study are time period of the bridge with A-shaped pylon is less when compared to other two pylon shapes, and inverted-Y shaped pylon have a larger time period. And as the numbers of cables are increased, the time period has also increased, but the difference in time period between 6 cables and 7 cables is very high compared to increase in time period between 7 cables and 8 cables bridge for all kinds of pylon shapes. And from time history analysis, the maximum responses obtained for all the bridges are dependent on the type of ground motion they are subjected to. It is observed that the Inverted-Y shape pylon bridge has less response for Loma and Bhuj ground motion, whereas A-shape pylon bridge has less response for Elcentro earthquake when compared other pylon-shaped bridges.
