Measurements of water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) were performed by a modi cation of the wet cup method described by ASTM E 96-95, indicating that membranes with 10% nanocrystalline cellulose, prepared using a sulfuric acid, exhibited the lowest permeability value of 174 g mil/h m2 among the com- posite lms studied. Both the acacia and the softwood kraft pulp bers when used for xylan lm formation exhibited higher water vapor transmission rates at addition levels of 50% and no improvement at lower levels of 5% and 10%, in comparison to control xylan lms. Reinforcement of xylan with hydrochloric acid made nanocrystalline cellulose yielded lms that showed a reduction in water transmission but the reduction was not as signi cant as with the reinforcement of xylan with sulfuric nanocrystalline cellu- lose. The results showed that xylan lms reinforced with 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited reductions in water transmission rates of 362%, 62% and 61% over lms prepared with 10% softwood kraft bers, 10% acacia ber and 10% hydrochloric acid prepared nanocrystalline cellulose, respectively. The morphology of the resulting nanocomposite lms was examined by SEM and AFM which showed that control lms containing xylan and sorbitol had a more open structure as compared to xylan sorbitol lms containing sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. The results from FT-IR suggested strong interactions occurred between the nanocrystalline cellulose and the matrix. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction Petrochemically based polymers, such as polyole ns and polyesters, have been increasingly used as packaging materi- als due, in part, to their availability, low cost and favorable mechanical properties, but their non-biodegradability has gen- erated environmental concerns (Tharanathan & Saroja, 2001). The advantages of using biopolymers to produce such packaging lms include their renewability, availability, limited environmen- tal impact and simpli ed end-of-life disposal issues (Petersson & Oksman, 2006; Ragauskas et al., 2006; Samir, Alloin, & Dufresne, 2005). Early studies examined the application of chitosan, starch and cellulose derivatives for their lm forming properties (Krochta et al., 1994). Xylan is one of the most common hemicelluloses and is the most abundant polysaccharide in nature after cellu- lose (Coughlan & Hazlewood, 1993; Ebringerov & Heinze, 2000; Gabrielli & Gatenholm, 1998). Glucuronoxylan, isolated from aspen wood, when plasticized with xylitol or sorbitol has been used to produce lms that exhibit improved strength and oxygen Corresponding author.

Ragauskas). barrier properties with respect to control glucuronoxylan lms (Gr ndahl, Eriksson, & Gatenholm, 2004; Linder, Bergman, Bodin, & Gatenholm, 2003). H ije, Gr ndahl, T mmeraas, and Gatenholm (2005) have shown that arabinoxylan lms can be prepared from the extracts of barley husks without the need for plasticizers. Dammstr m, Salm n, and Gatenholm (2005) showed that lms based on glucuronoxylan reinforced with bacterial cellulose have tensile strength values ranging between 65 and 110 MPa. Xylan has also been used as an additive with wheat gluten for the pro- duction of biodegradable composite lms (Kayserilioglu, Bakir, Yilaz, & Akkas, 2003). The xylan did not adversely affect the lm forming quality or water vapor transmission rate, although mechanical and solubility properties were dependent on the quan- tity of xylan in the wheat gluten. Water vapor transmission rate is an important property for many lm packaging appli- cations in uencing shelf life and product stability. Tock (1983) reviewed some of the permeability and water vapor transmis- sion rate properties of commercial polymeric lms and provided an overview of how structural changes, such as crystallinity, and the presence of plasticizers and lamination can in uence the bar- rier properties of polymer lms. Miranda, Garnica, Lara-Sagahon, and C rdenas (2004) discussed water vapor transmission values of chitosan lm plasticized with sorbitol, glycerol or polyethy- lene glycol reporting values from 1.3 to 1.5 10 3 [g/(m2 h Pa)]. 0144-8617/$ see front matter 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Saxena et al. / Carbohydrate Polymers 84 (2011) 1371 1377 Aydinli and Tutas (2000) determined WVP of (6.3 11.6) 10 5 [g mm/(m2 h Pa)] for polyethylene glycol-plasticized locust bean gum as compared to (6.2 11.6) 10 5 [g mm/(m2 h Pa)] reported by Mikkonen, Heikkil , Hel n, Hyv nen, and Tenkanen (2010). The WVP of sorbitol-plasticized oat spelt arabinoxylan lms studied using a fan-equipped desiccator was 4.5 10 5 [g mm/(m2 h Pa)] (Mikkonen et al., 2009), while P roval, Debeaufort, Despr , and Voilley (2002) reported a value of 63.7 10 5 [g mm/(m2 h Pa)] for corn arabinoxylan lms. Saxena, Elder, Shaobo, and Ragauskas (2009) have shown that the addition of 7% sulfuric nanocellulose whiskers to xylan increased the tensile energy absorption of the resulting lms by 445% and the tensile strength of the lm by 141%. The improvements in mechanical properties of the compos- ite lm based on reinforcement with cellulose whiskers can be attributed to the formation of a rigid hydrogen-bonded network of cellulose whiskers that is governed by the percolation mecha- nism (Samir et al., 2005). Recent studies by Saxena and Ragauskas (2009) have also shown that xylan lms reinforced with 10% sulfu- ric nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited a 74% reduction in speci c water transmission properties with respect to control xylan lm and 362% improvement with respect to xylan reinforced with 10% softwood kraft pulps. The objective of this study is to compare these previous results with xylan lms reinforced with hydrochloric acid prepared nanocrystalline cellulose and lms reinforced with aca- cia and softwood bleached kraft bers. The bleached acacia kraft ber was selected because it is one of the shortest commercially available pulp bers with a weight-weighted length of 0.62 mm and width of 0.02 mm and yet is approximately 4000 orders of magnitude larger than the cellulosic whiskers employed. 2. Experimental 2.1. Materials Oat spelt xylan and sorbitol were obtained from Aldrich and used as received. The plant derived xylan was shown to con- sist of 81.0% xylose, 9.8% arabinose, 7.6% glucose, 1.4% galactose and 0.2% of mannose. For all studies, a dry commercial elemen- tal chlorine-free (ECF) bleached softwood (SW) kraft pulp and fully bleached acacia kraft pulp were used as received. The arith- metic mean length and curl of acacia kraft bers and softwood bers were 0.653 0.028 mm, 0.088 0.005 and 2.276 0.052 mm, 0.089 0.006 mm respectively as determined using a ber quality analyzer (FQA). Dialysis tubes were purchased from Spectrum Labs. All other reagents and solvents were purchased from Aldrich and used as received. 2.2. Preparation of sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose An aqueous suspension of nanocrystalline cellulose was pre- pared following the procedure outlined by Pu et al. (2007). In brief, softwood kraft pulp was ground in a Wiley mill to pass through a 20-mesh screen. The acid hydrolysis of the milled pulp was accom- plished with 64 wt% sulfuric acid at 45 C for 45 min with stirring. The reaction was halted by adding a 10-fold excess of deionized (DI) water. The sediment was centrifuged for 20 min at 11,000 rpm and the precipitate was collected, re-dispersed and re-centrifuged twice. The solids suspension was then dialyzed against DI water for 3 days using regenerated cellulose dialysis tubing (Spectra/Por membrane, MWCO 50K) until the pH of the solution was neu- tral. Sonication was then performed on the whiskers solution for 35 min while immersed in an ice bath. The average yield of cellu- losic whiskers was 35%. The bulk charge for the starting cellulose bers and whiskers was determined using a method developed by Katz, Beatson, and Scallan (1984) and was found to be 3.82 mmol carboxylate groups/100 g and 9.73 mmol acid groups/100 g, respec- tively. 2.3. Preparation of hydrochloride nanocrystalline cellulose An aqueous suspension of hydrochloric nanocrystalline cellu- lose was prepared following the procedure outlined by Araki, Wada, Kuga, and Okano (1998). Fully bleached softwood kraft pulp with 7% wet-basis moisture content was Wiley milled to pass through a 0.5 mm mesh screen. A sample of this ground pulp (36.00 g, oven-dried weight) was treated with an aqueous 4.0 N HCl solu- tion (2600 mL) at 80 C for 8 h. The reaction was terminated by diluting the mixture with deionized water (8 L). After standing overnight, the clear supernatant was decanted and the settled cel- lulosics were diluted with deionized water (8 L) and then allowed to settle. This procedure was repeated until the pH of the supernatant was approximately 3. The cellulosics were then transferred to a series of dialysis tubes (Spectra/Por membrane, MWCO 50K) and dialyzed against deionized water for several days until the solu- tion pH was >4 and the supernatant became turbid. The cellulosics were next sonicated with an Ultrasonic Processor GEX-500 for 2 min followed by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 5 min. The turbid supernatant was decanted, the sediment was dispersed in deion- ized water, sonicated for 2 min and re-centrifuged. This procedure was repeated until the supernatant become clear. The cellulosic suspensions were concentrated by centrifugation at 11,000 rpm for 25 min and the clear supernatant was discarded, resulting in a nal consistency of 1.57% for the whiskers. The concentrated whisker suspension was used directly to form nanocomposites. The gravimetric yield of HCl generated whiskers was 7 10%. The HCl generated whiskers had an absence of strong acid groups but weak acid groups of 1.4 mmol/100 g. 2.4. Preparation of xylan nanocomposite lm Xylan composite lms were formed by adding an aqueous sus- pension (35.00 mL) of sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose suspension to xylan (0.25 g). The solid nanocrystalline cellulose content in the suspension used was 0.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 50.0 wt% of the total mixture of sorbitol, xylan, and nanocrystalline cellulose. Sorbitol (0.25 g, 1.37 mmol) was added to the mixture with stirring and the mixture was heated to 95 C for 15 min. The solution was then poured into polystyrene petri dishes (4.60 cm diameter) and allowed to dry at room temperature for three days. The resulting thickness of xylan lms reinforced with sulfuric cellulose whiskers was 0.091 0.002 mm thick. Xylan composite lms containing hydrochloride generated nanocrystalline cellulose, ECF bleached kraft softwood and aca- cia bers were prepared with the same procedure used to form xylan sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose composite lms. The thick- ness of resulting composite lms for xylan 10% softwood ber lm was 0.244 mm, xylan 10% acacia ber was 0.0886 and xylan 10% hydrochloride nanocrystalline cellulose was 0.096 mm, with stan- dard deviation of 0.088 mm, 0.065 mm and 0.005 mm, respectively. 2.5. Water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) The WVTR analysis was performed as described by ASTM E 96-95. Films were sealed to 4.60 cm diameter petri dish with a 5-min epoxy adhesive. The sample dish containing deionized water (10.00 mL) was weighed and placed in a convection oven at a setting of 37.0 C in the oven. The sample dish was period- ically removed and weighed. The weight loss over a period of 24 h was determined to access the WVTR of the lms. The water vapor transmission rate was calculated using: WVTR = mass of water lost/time area = ux/area with units of g d 1 m 2. The per- A. Saxena et al. / Carbohydrate Polymers 84 (2011) 1371 1377 1373 centage of error as determined by percentage error = (standard deviation/mean) 100 was less than 7%. 2.6. Optical microscopy analysis The composite lms were mounted on microscope slides and examined with Leica DMLM optical microscope. Bright- eld images were collected with a transmitted light detector. 2.7. Electron microscopy Differences in cross-section and surface morphology of the com- posite lms were analyzed using a Hitachi S800, thermally assisted eld emission (TFE) scanning electron microscope (SEM) with an accelerating voltage of 12 kV. The samples were sputter-coated with gold prior to examination. 2.7.1. Atomic force microscopy Nanocrystalline cellulose and lms were analyzed using a Dimension 3100 scanning probe microscope and Nanoscope III con- troller. The images were acquired in tapping mode in air using an etched silicon probe with the cantilever resonance frequency of 150 kHz. Scans were done at 2 m. 2.8. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) FT-IR analysis was performed in an absorbance range of 4000 500 cm 1, to compare the control xylan lms with the nanocomposite lms using Bruker Vector 22 FT-IR. 3. Results and discussion This study examines the reinforcement of xylan/sorbitol lms with nanocrystalline cellulose, bleached acacia ber and softwood kraft bers and its impact on water transmission. By AFM analysis, nanocrystalline cellulose was observed to have rod like structure with an average length of sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose in range of 150 200 nm and a width of less than 20 nm while hydrochloric nanocrystalline cellulose had an average length of 200 300 nm and a width slightly less than 20 nm. These results are consistent with the literature reported for nanocrystalline cellulose prepared from softwood kraft pulps using sulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid. Recently, studies by Saxena et al. (2009) have reported that oat- spelt xylan, plasticized with sorbitol and reinforced with 7% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose increased the tensile energy absorption of the xylan lms by 445% and the tensile strength of the lm by 141% with respect to control xylan lm. Saxena and Ragauskas (2009) have also shown that when xylan lms are reinforced with 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose, WVTR reduces from 304 g/h m2 for control to 174 g mil/h m2 for xylan sulfuric nanocrystalline cel- lulose lms. To determine the impact of alternative cellulosic llers on water transmission properties, a series of xylan composite lms were prepared and analyzed using the water vapor transmission test. In the current work, similar experiments were performed using acacia ber and hydrochloric prepared nanocrystalline cellu- lose as reinforcement in a xylan lm. Because the thickness of the xylan sulfonated nanocrystalline cellulose, xylan softwood ber and xylan acacia ber are different, the WVTR was normalized to lm thickness (l) with units in mm to obtain the speci c water vapor transmission rate (R = WVTR l) with units of g mm/d m2 (Hu, Topolkaraev, Hiltner, & Baer, 2000). Xylan lms reinforced with 10% acacia ber and 10% hydrochlo- ric nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited virtually no improvement in speci c water vapor transmission rate in comparison to control. Xylan lm reinforced with 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose exhibited lowest speci c water transmission rate of 174 g mil/h m2 Table 1 Speci c water vapor transmission rate of xylan lms.

Water vapor transmission rate for xylan lms. and xylan lm with softwood ber exhibited highest water trans- mission rate as summarized in Table 1. The water transmission rate at other levels is summarized in Fig. 1. It was found that the addition of 5% softwood kraft pulp bers yielded a xylan lm with increased speci c water vapor transmission rate and a signi cant high water vapor transmission rate at 50% dosage with respect to control. The addition of softwood kraft bers in the xylan lm causes a signi - cant high speci c water vapor transmission rate at any dosages (5%, 10% and 50%). The addition of hydrochloric acid prepared nanocrys- talline cellulose to xylan lms was also analyzed for speci c water transmission rate. The speci c WVTR values decreased as the con- tent of HCl generated nanocrystalline cellulose in the xylan lm increased from 0% to 5% and further decreases at higher dosage of 50% addition in the xylan. WVTR values of xylan 50% hydrochlo- ric nanocrystalline cellulose are almost similar to the values of xylan 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. The rate of water transmission for the composite xylan and con- trol lms for rst 24 h is summarized in Fig. 2. As can be seen, the control xylan lm has a higher rate of weight of water loss per unit time whereas 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose and 50% hydrochloride generated nanocrystalline cellulose reinforced xylan lms have the lowest weight difference loss per unit time. The rate increases initially then remains constant for control, sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose and hydrochloric nanocrystalline cellu- lose reinforced lm but for acacia and softwood ber reinforced lm, the rate shows an increase trend. The mechanism of water transmission can be attributed to a diffusion process in which water vapor condenses and dissolves on lm surface and then liquid water diffuses through the membrane and nally water vapor evaporates from the other side of lm. The low initial rate can be described as initial adsorption phase when water vapor condenses and dis- solves on lm surface and then liquid water diffuses through the membrane and nally water vapor evaporates from the other side of lm. The incorporation of sulfonated cellulose whiskers was found to reduce WVTR properties which can be attributed to the tortu- ous path the water molecules have to travel around the cellulose whiskers to diffuse through the lm. Since,the llermaterialiscrys- talline together with the dense, rigid hydrogen bonded network, it acts as a physical barrier to the transport of the diffusing molecules. 1374 A.

FTIR of xylan 10% different llers composite lm. Furthermore, since cellulose whisker and xylan are hydrophilic in nature, the diffusing water molecules could be absorbed via hydrogen bonding, which would also alter the ux. Once steady state equilibrium is attained, the ux remains constant. It appears that pulp bers cannot form an integrated matrix that cellulose whiskers can and this latter effect has a substantial bene t in the overall reduction of water transmission. The uneven structure and agglomeration of the xylan can be the cause of higher water transmission rate of control xylan lm in comparison to xylan rein- forced with sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. Figs. 3 and 4 show the FT-IR spectra of xylan lms containing sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose, acacia ber, softwood kraft pulp bers and hydrochloric nanocrystalline cellulose, respectively. Several characteristic bands of nanocrystalline cellulose can be readily assigned at 3340 cm 1 (OH stretch) and 2893 cm 1 (CH2 stretch). A strong absorption band can be observed at 3330 cm 1 after addition of nanocrys- talline cellulose for all concentrations, related to the typical O H vibration of crystalline nanocellulose. The intensity of overall O H band (3200 3450 cm 1) increases with the nanocellulose whiskers concentration. This can be attributed to an increase of hydro- gen bonding between xylan and nanocrystalline cellulose and the strong interactions between nanocrystalline cellulose surface and the matrix which is comparable to Khan s FT-IR study with whiskers and methylcellulose (Khan et al., 2010). Other bands 1160 and 1070 cm 1 have their intensity increased after nanocrystalline cel- lulose addition and these bands are speci c to cellulose, and some of them have been studied in detail to determine the crystalline organization (Akeholm, Hinterstoisser, & Salmen, 2004). Strong peaks around 1100 cm 1 assigned to secondary alcohol. The peak at 1205 cm 1 is sulfate peak of cellulose nanocrystalline cellulose from the esteri cation reaction. The peak at (3200 3450 cm 1) of the nanocomposite moved to higher wavenumbers suggesting a strong interaction occurred between the ller and the matrix (Li, Zhou, & Zhang, 2009). The interactions between cellulose and xylan in a model system consisting of bacterial cellulose/glucuronoxylan have been studied in the past that showed strong interactions existed between cellulose and xylan (Dammstr m, Salm n, & Gatenholm, 2009). Optical microscope images of xylan, xylan softwood kraft ber and xylan nanocrystalline cellulose lms were acquired both before and after the water transmission rate studies and these results are summarized in Figs. 5 7. The xylan sulfuric nanocrys- talline cellulose lm appears denser than control xylan lm as seen in Fig. 5. Optical microscope images of xylan acacia lms were acquired before the WVTR test and immediately after and these results are summarized in Fig. 6. Xylan acacia lms appear swollen after the water vapor transmission study as can be seen in Fig. 6(a) and (b). All the lms retain their shape after the water transmission test but the control lm appears weaker than lm reinforced with nanocrystalline cellulose. It appears that the mechanical proper- ties of all the lms deteriorated after water vapor transmission test which may be attributed to interference of water with the asso- ciated hydrogen bonding between matrix and llers and this may make the lms weaker. The speci c density of xylan lms was also calculated and the result shows that the xylan 10% nanocrystalline cellulose lms were denser than the control xylan, xylan 10% soft- wood and xylan 10% acacia lms with speci c densities of 0.7616, 0.7272, 0.1780 and 0.1132 g/cm3 respectively. The less dense struc- ture of the control xylan, xylan 10% softwood and xylan 10% acacia lms in comparison to the xylan 10% nanocrystalline cellulose lm leads to lower water transmission rates for the xylan sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose lms in comparison to the other lms. The xylan control lm shown in Fig. 5(a) exhibits hexag- onal platelets like pattern (Marchessault, Morehead, Walter, Glaudemans, & Timell, 1961). The optical micrograph of xylan lm reinforced with softwood kraft bers, exhibited in Fig. 7(c), shows ber aggregation which may provides channels in the membrane that allow for more rapid permeation of water. Nanocrystalline cellulose have been reported to have crys- tallinity values greater than 60% (De Souza Lima & Borsali, 2004; Ioelovich, 2008). This property, together with the result- ing rigid hydrogen-bonded network of nanocrystalline cellulose was attributed to cause an increase in tortuousity (Saxena, Elder, A. Saxena et al. / Carbohydrate Polymers 84 (2011) 1371 1377 1375 Fig. 5. Optical microscope image of (a) control xylan and (b) xylan reinforced with sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose. Fig. 6. .

Kenvin, & Ragauskas, 2010) for water molecules to follow and the crystalline portion nanocellulose may further lower the water transmission rate as compared to more open structure of control xylan lm as can be seen in Fig. 8(a) and (b). SEM images of control xylan lm surface in Fig. 9(a) shows agglomeration in comparison to well dispersed sulfuric nanocrys- talline cellulose on xylan surface in Fig. 9(b). The uneven structure and agglomeration of the bers can provide increase free volume of the matrix polymer leading to higher diffusivity of the per- meating water molecules in the control xylan lm which may cause higher water vapor transmission rate of control xylan in comparison to xylan reinforced with sulfuric nanocrystalline cel- lulose. It appears that pulp bers cannot form an integrated matrix that nanocrystalline cellulose can and this latter effect has a substantial bene t in the overall reduction of water transmission. 4. Conclusions Cellulose whiskers were incorporated into xylan slurry to pre- pare biodegradable lms with improved water barrier properties. It appears that the high degree of crystallinity of nanocellu- lose, the dense composite structure of the formed lms with nanocrystalline cellulose and xylan leads to a lm that has reduced moisture transmission properties. These effects were attributed to a rigid hydrogen-bonded network of hydrogen bonded nanocel- lulose to form an integrated matrix as described by percolation theory. Optical microscopic images indicated that xylan incor- porated with softwood kraft ber and acacia ber exhibit ber aggregation in comparison to well dispersed sulfuric nanocrys- talline cellulose on xylan surface as indicated in optical and SEM images of xylan sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose lm. This pro- vides more open structure for more rapid permeation in control xylan, xylan softwood kraft ber and xylan acacia bers leading to higher water vapor transmission rate as compared to xylan sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose lms which have substantially lower water vapor transmission rate. The synergistic xylan 10% sulfuric nanocrystalline cellulose performed well and show poten- tial for the development of improved biodegradable barrier membranes.
