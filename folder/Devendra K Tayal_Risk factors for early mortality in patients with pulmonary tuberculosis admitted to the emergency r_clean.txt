Introduction Tuberculosis (TB) is a major public health problem world- wide. A signi cant number of patients die due to TB across the globe despite good control programmes in many coun- tries including India.1 The best WHO estimate is that around 10.0 million people developed TB disease in 2018, with 1.2 million deaths from TB, including 251,000 Human Immunod- e ciency Virus (HIV) positive people.1 In India the estimated number of new TB cases was 2,700,000 accounting for about a quarter of the world s TB burden with 440,000 deaths in 2018.1---3 The India National TB Elimination Plan 2017---2025 introduced a mortality target (90% reduction by 2025, i.e. global reduction from 32 to 3 death per 100,000 population)3 to contribute to monitoring this core parameter. The literature on factors associated with early mortal- ity of patients with TB is scanty. The available studies are based on cohort analysis of treatment outcomes and, with a single exception,4 analysed long-term mortality with a retrospective approach.5---11 These studies identi ed drug- resistant TB and HIV infection as the main determinants of mortality.4---8 The risk factors for early and long-term mortal- ity are likely to be different. Adequate identi cation of early mortality predictors would allow clinicians to early identify patients at risk. Moreover, as after Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission the surviving patients often need pulmonary reha- bilitation, a more precise risk strati cation of these cases would be very useful, both from a clinical and public health perspective.12---16 The aims of this prospective case-control study were: 1) to identify risk factors of patients with TB associated with early mortality (within one week from admission); 2) to develop a simple risk score to be easily assessed in periph- eral units to call for rapid clinical action and prevention of avoidable mortality. Methods This is an international collaborative prospective case- control study consisting of two steps: 1: to identify the risk factors independently associated to early mortality; and 2: based on them, to design a simple risk score which can be applied in all health facilities to prevent early mortality. Setting and patients This collaborative study was conducted between May 2017 and May 2019 at the National Institute of Tuberculosis and Respiratory Diseases, New Delhi, India (a referral, tertiary level institute for TB management) in collaboration with the Maugeri Institute, Tradate, Italy (a reference centre with interest in TB research and rehabilitation).13 In India one of four admissions to the emergency department are due to patients with diagnosed or presumptive TB. All consec- utive bacteriologically con rmed (at direct sputum smear and XPERT MTB/RIF assay) patients admitted at the emer- gency department with symptoms and/or signs suggestive of TB (e.g. cough, fever, or hemoptysis, for more than two weeks) were enrolled in the study upon consultation with the Maugeri Institute. The patients who died within 7 days after admission within the study period were de ned as cases and those surviving were de ned as controls. All causes of death were documented. The study was approved by the ethics and research com- mittee of the participating institutions (N 12,007/2017 dated 07-02-2017 and 12,733/2017 dated 01-03-2017, respectively). Patients (when not possible, the relatives) signed the informed consent. Study design All enrolled patients underwent a comprehensive clinical examination and a detailed medical history. All the ndings were entered in a clinical data-collection form, including: 1 Demographics and anthropometrics; socio-economic status as per Kuppuswamy scale.17; smoking history (number of bidis and cigarettes smoked per day mul- tiplied by the year of smoking); alcohol use history according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, (DSM-IV) criteria for alcohol dependence18; 2 Duration of signs and symptoms; history of previous anti- TB treatment; direct sputum smear for acid fast bacilli; co-morbidities (diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, co-infection with HIV and cardiovas- cular diseases); 3 Clinical signs: arterial blood pressure, pulse rate, respi- ratory rate, body temperature, and presence/absence of wheezing; 4 Laboratory: Pulse oximetry (SpO2) and arterial blood gases; blood count, renal and liver function tests, serum electrolytes; 5 As per Indian guidelines all patients were tested for HIV co-infection. 6 All patients underwent a postero-anterior chest radio- graphy read by two independent expert clinicians and Early mortality among tuberculosis patients 37 classi ed according to the USA National Tuberculosis Association criteria19 as follows: (7) Minimal lesions. Without cavities and of slight to mod- erate density. They may involve a small part of one or both lungs, but the total extent (regardless of distri- bution) should not exceed the volume of lung on one side that occupies the space above the second chondro- sternal junction and the spine of the forth -or body of the fth- vertebra. (8) Moderately advanced lesions. Localized in one or both lungs, cavities (if present) with a total diameter below 4 cm, with total extent not exceed the following: a. disseminated lesions of slight to moderate density throughout the total volume of one lung or the equiva- lent in both lungs; b. dense and con uent lesions limited in extent to one-third the volume of a single lung. (9) Far advanced lesions. More extensive than the moder- ately advanced ones. Other chest X-ray details (such as unilateral/ bilateral, with/without cavities) were also recorded. Discrepancies in reading were resolved by consensus. Statistical analysis Sample size calculation Preliminary data from the emergency department ( rst quarter 2016) indicate that out of 175 admissions, 69 were due to bacteriologically con rmed TB patients, with high mortality within the rst week following admission (5/69, 7.2%). The hypothesis guiding the study design and the sam- ple size calculation is that a fraction of this mortality is preventable via rapid referral to higher clinical level, given adequate criteria to identify the patients are available and that a suitable cut-off to de ne early mortality is one week. Therefore, considering these assumptions with 95% con - dence interval and 3% absolute precision, the sample size was calculated as follows: n = Z2 (1 /2)PQ d2 = (1.96)2 (0.07) (0.93) (0.1) (0.1) n = Sample size;  = 0.05; P = Percentage of patient with diag- nosis of PTB; Q = (1-P); Z = 1.96 at signi cance level of 5%; d = Absolute precision The resulting sample size of 243, was rounded up to 250. Step 1: de ning risk factors for early mortality Both univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the risk factors independently associ- ated with early mortality. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically signi cant. Step 2: de ning a simple risk score to predict early mortality Among the independent factors signi cantly associated to early mortality in the multiple logistic regression analysis, we identi ed those which could be easily evaluated in a peripheral health unit; they were used to design a clinical prediction model able to stratify the risk of death among TB patients. A speci c weight was assigned to each vari- able based on their Odds Ratios (i.e., the risk factor with a higher odds ratio got a higher weighted score). The scores were then used to classify patients into levels of increasing risk of mortality. The study data was analysed and the scores assigned with several simulations in such a way that no patient group with lower mortality risk would be placed at a higher level (and vice-versa). A higher risk score was therefore expected to be associated with a higher probability of early mortality. Proportions were calculated for categorical variables and mean Standard Deviation (SD) for continuous variables. The data were entered in Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sci- ences (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) version 21.0. Results The analysis was performed on 250 patients out of which 49 were cases (patients who died within one week from admission) and 201 controls (those who survived). Their characteristics are summarized in Table 1. Step 1: risk factors for early mortality From the univariate analysis the factors signi cantly asso- ciated with mortality were: lower socio-economic status, longer treatment duration, severe malnutrition (assessed by Body Mass Index ---- BMI), previous history of anti-TB treat- ment, advanced disease on chest radiography, tachycardia, hypotension and tachypnoea, anaemia, sepsis, thrombo- cytopenia, electrolyte dis-balance including hyponatremia and hypokalemia, SpO2 90%, hypercapnia, hypoxaemia and hypoproteinemia. As shown in Table 2, the factors independently and signi- cantly associated with mortality at the multiple logistic regression analysis were SpO2 90%, severe malnutrition, tachypnea, tachycardia, hypotension, advanced disease at chest radiography, severe anaemia, hypoxaemia, hypona- tremia, hypoproteinemia and hypercapnia. Only four patients diagnosed with TB were co-infected with HIV. Four patients were infected by rifampicin-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis among cases and 18 among controls. Step 2: simple risk score to predict early mortality The ve signi cant risk parameters from the multivariate logistic regression analysis and easy to measure in eld conditions include: SpO2 90%, tachypnoea, hypotension, advanced disease at chest radiography and tachycardia (Table 3A). Using the weights summarised in Table 3A, the scoring system to stratify the risk of death was designed assign- ing a score from 0 to 6+ to each patient (Table 3B). The mortality rate associated with a risk score of 1---2, 3---5 and 6 was found to be 15%, 33% and 87.5%, respectively. The prediction model had area under receiver operating char- acteristic (ROC) curve (Fig. 1) of 0.86 indicating a very good predictability of the model. This model predicted early 38 R. Singla et al.

Discussion This prospective study assessed the risk factors of patients with TB associated with early mortality at the emergency department level in a developing country. Furthermore, it allowed us to stratify the mortality risk by using basic and easy measurable parameters. To the best of our knowl- edge, our study is also the rst prospective study speci cally designed and powered to study early mortality of these patients admitted to the emergency department and to propose a clinical prediction model to stratify all the patients admitted to an emergency department for early mortality.9---11 Although the evidence raised is limited to India, and more evidence is needed, the model is likely to be useful in other intermediate and low-income settings, being based on simple parameters. Early referral to intensive care is likely to reduce preventable early mortality. Our study suggests that severe malnutrition is an inde- pendent risk factor for mortality. In a study by Yung-Feng Yen et al.20 severe malnutrition was signi cantly associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality in these patients. The Indian Government has considered malnutrition in patients with TB as a serious concern and framed a national policy to provide nancial aid to all patients by transferring cash incentives every month to their accounts till the completion of treatment as an initiative to improve their nutritional status.2 In our study severe anaemia was observed in 46.9% of cases, as compared to 19.1% of controls. Anaemia was associated with mortality in a retrospective case-control study in South Africa in which 50% of patients died.10 Interestingly enough, the factors independently and sig- ni cantly associated with mortality in our study did not include history of previous treatment. As the treatment of drug-susceptible TB has not changed over the last four decades and the prevalence of drug resistance is alarming in several countries (including India), new drugs and regimens are urgently needed.21,22 The use of clinical prediction rules (CPRs) gained recent relevance in the eld of pulmonary diseases. Most of the prediction rules available so far in the area of TB cover diag- nosis, with only three studies providing prognosis-centred CPRs.11,23---29 Wejse et al.28 proposed the rst CPR (the BandimTBscore) in a low-resource country (Guinea-Bissau), based on ve symptoms and six clinical signs. However, the study included HIV-positive patients who might have been independent risk factors for mortality.24 Horita et al.30 developed a CPR to predict in-hospital TB mortality. How- ever, exclusion of multi-drug resistant cases might have biased the conclusions as well as excluding co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes) from their prediction model.30 Bastos et al.11 conducted a retrospective cohort study in Portugal and selected ve risk parameters in patients with pulmonary TB to formulate a risk assessment tool. They strati ed patients into low (score 2), moderate (score 3---5) and high (score 6) mortality risk. However, six-month mortality was taken as the outcome measure. Patients with higher scores are likely to bene t from early admission to intensive/advanced medical care units. Impor- tantly, the prediction of mortality is independent from both the patients collaboration and the clinician s subjective judgement. Recent evidence suggests that a signi cant propor- tion of TB cases are affected by functional abnormalities (obstruction, restriction, mixed pattern) at the end of their treatment as a consequence of sequelae.12---16 Recent evidence is also available on the need for pulmonary reha- bilitation following surgery for TB.31---32 A more accurate Early mortality among tuberculosis patients 41 evaluation of severely ill patients with pulmonary TB with earlier access to intensive care for those for which indica- tion exists will minimise mortality, increase the proportion of patients successfully cured and probably lower the occur- rence of post-treatment sequelae. Further studies on this are needed. Study limitations Some demographic factors like age and sex did not match between cases and controls. Only four patients were HIV-TB co-infected, as the prevalence of HIV-TB co-infection in the Delhi population is much lower when compared to national gures.33 Therefore, the in uence of this important factor on early mortality could not be properly evaluated. Fur- thermore, the study was conducted in a TB hospital where usually patients with advanced disease are admitted, so the mortality rates might be skewed. Furthermore, the 7 days cut-off to de ne early mortality (cases) is arbitrary and the proposed score needs to be tested in different settings and countries to de ne its generalisability. Conclusions The ve signi cant risk parameters which are independently and signi cantly associated with mortality in TB patients and are easy to measure in eld conditions include: SpO2 90%, tachypnoea, hypotension, advanced disease at chest radiography and tachycardia. We propose a scoring system to predict a mortality rate in patients with severe pul- monary TB admitted to an emergency department. The study may help clinicians at the periphery level to early identify severely ill patients using a scoring system based on simple parameters. These parameters, easily measur- able in peripheral health institutions of any setting would allow early referral of such patients to specialised centres to reduce mortality, improve success rates, minimise the need for pulmonary rehabilitation and prevent post-treatment sequelae. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the workplace safety when potentially infectious TB cases are admitted, and the role of appropriate airborne infection control measures in reducing the risk of transmission to other patients, health care workers and visitors.34 Finally, although internal validation of the risk score was performed, additional studies validating the score in similar and differ- ent settings would allow us to clearly de ne a potentially useful prognostic score for severe TB patients.
