We propose a novel concept for assigning con dent weights to the experts based on cardinals of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IVIFSSs). The con dent weight is assigned to each of the experts based on their pre- ferred attributes and opinions, which reduces the chances of biasness. Instead of using medical knowledgebase, the proposed algorithm mainly relies on the set of attributes pre- ferred by the group of experts. To make the set of preferred attributes more important, we use combined choice matrix, which is combined with the individual IVIFSM to produce the corresponding product IVIFSM. This article uses IVIFSMs for representing the ex- perts opinions. IVIFSM is the matrix representation of IVIFSS and IVIFSS is a natural combination of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) and soft set. Finally, the performance of the proposed algorithm is validated using a case study from real life. 1 Introduction Molodtsov [1] introduced soft set theory as a generic mathematical tool for dealing with uncer- tain problems, which cannot be handled using tra- ditional mathematical tools such as theory of prob- ability [2], theory of fuzzy sets [3], rough set theory [4], and the interval mathematics. All these theories have their own inherent dif culties due to the inade- quacy of the parameterization. Molodtsov s soft set [1] is free from such kind of dif culties, which can be used for approximate description of objects with- out any restriction. Due to this absence of restric- tion on the approximate description, soft set theory has been emerging as a convenient and easily appli- cable tool in practice. Since its introduction, soft set theory has been successfully applied in many different elds such as decision making [5-12], data analysis [13], fore- casting [14], simulation [15], optimization [16], texture classi cation [17], etc. Maji et al. [18] pre- sented some operations for soft sets and also dis- cussed their properties. They presented the con- cept of fuzzy soft set (FSS) [19] which is based on a combination of the fuzzy set and soft set mod- 77 DOI 10.2478/jaiscr-2014-0025 58 Tambouratzis T., Souliou D., Chalikias M., Gregoriades A. els. Yang et al. [20] introduced the concept of the interval-valued fuzzy soft set (IVFSS) by combin- ing the interval-valued fuzzy set and soft set and then explained a decision making algorithm based on IVFSS. Decision making problems were solved rst by Maji and Roy [11] using soft sets. They [12] studied a soft set theoretic approach to deal with de- cision making and introduced the concept of choice value. Combining soft set [1] with intuitionistic fuzzy set [25, 33], Maji et al. [21 23] introduced the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy soft sets (IFSS). The suitability of IFSS for the decision making ap- plications is found in [24]. Das and Kar [31] pro- posed an algorithmic approach for group decision making based on IFSS. The authors [31] have used cardinals of IFSS as a novel concept for assigning con dent weight to the set of experts. Cagman and Enginoglu [6-7] pioneered the concept of soft ma- trix to represent a soft set. Mao et al. [30] pre- sented the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy soft ma- trix (IFSM) and applied it in group decision making problems. Jiang et al. [26] introduced IVIFSS by combining interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set and soft set and discussed their properties. Jiang et al. [9] presented an adjustable approach to IFSS based decision making by using level soft sets of IFSSs. Feng et al. [27] extended the level soft sets method to interval-valued fuzzy soft sets. Qin et al. [28] generalized the approaches introduced by Feng et al. [27] and Jiang et al. [9]. They [28] de- ned the notion of reduct IFSSs and presented an adjustable approach for decision making based on IVIFSS. Zhang et al. [29] investigated the decision making problems based on IVIFSS. They [29] de- veloped an adjustable approach to IVIFSSs based decision making using level soft sets. Recently, Das et al. in [32] have introduced IVIFSM and applied it to multiple attribute decision making problems. Das and Kar [34-35] have also introduced the con- cept of intuitionistic multi fuzzy soft set (IMFSS) and hesitant fuzzy soft set (HFSS) and applied them in decision making problem. Preceding discussion narrates that a few de- cision making approaches [26, 28, 29, 32] have been developed by the researchers in the context of IVIFSS. In [26], Jiang et al. introduced IV- IFSSs and discussed their various operations and properties. In [28], authors presented an adjustable approach to IVIFSS based decision making using reduct IFSS and level soft sets of IFSS. Zhang et al. in [29] developed an adjustable approach to IVIFSS based decision making. They [29] also de ned the concept of the weighted IVIFSS, where they em- phasized the importance of the parameters in IV- IFSS. Then they presented a decision making ap- proach using weighted IVIFSS. Authors introduced IVIFSM in [32] and studied a novel algorithmic ap- proach focussing on the choice parameters of dif- ferent experts. Since decision makers/experts ex- press their opinions based on the available infor- mation and domain of expertise of different experts are different, so a prioritising mechanism of various experts are necessary to introduce a quality deci- sion making paradigm. Due to lack of information or limited domain knowledge, experts often prefer to express their opinions only for a subset of at- tributes instead of the entire set of attributes. As a result, some decision makers may express their opinions to more numbers of attributes, while others show their interest only for a few attributes. Nor- mally, more importance can be assigned to those experts who encompass more attributes. In an- other case, an expert who is more con dent about some set of attributes can be assigned more impor- tance. For having better decision making outcome in MAGDM problems, importance or weight of var- ious decision makers imparts a huge signi cance in the entire process. But as per our knowledge, this mechanism can be found only in [31], where au- thors have used a novel concept in terms of con - dent weight assigning mechanism of experts in the framework of IFSS. None have implemented the idea presented in [31] for group decision making us- ing IVIFSS. Motivated by this idea, we have intro- duced a MAGDM algorithm using con dent weight assigning of experts in the context of IVIFSS. The proposed algorithm mainly focuses on the choice parameters/attributes of various experts and com- putes the con dent weight of an expert based on her prescribed opinions. We have used cardinals of IVIFSS for measuring the weight. The proposed con dent weight also reduces the chance of biasing. Once the weights are assigned to individual experts opinions, this article present a consensus reaching approach based on IVIFSM, combined choice ma- trix, product IVIFSM, score, and accuracy values. We have used a case study related to heart dis- ease diagnosis, where two cases are shown. Case I shows the nal outcome without assigning any weight, whereas case II shows the result by assign- 59 MAXIMISING ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY OF. . . ing weight. As per the experimental result, these two cases show different ordering of diseases. Rest of this article is organized as follows. In section 2, we brie y review some basic notions and background of soft sets, FSSs, IVFSSs, IVIFSSs, and IVIFSMs. Section 3 presents IVIFSM and a few operations on it. The cardinal of IVIFSS is in- troduced in section 4 followed by the proposed al- gorithmic approach in section 5. A case study has been illustrated in section 6 to verify the practicabil- ity and effectiveness of the proposed method. Then a brief discussion on the results is given in section 7. Finally, key conclusions are drawn in section 8. 2 Preliminaries This section brie y reviews some basic concepts re- lated with this article. 2.1 Soft Set Let U be an initial universal set and E be a set of parameters. Let P(U) denotes the power set of U and A E. A pair (F{A},E) is called a soft set [1] over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by F{A} : E P(U)such that F{A}(e) = /0 if e / A. In other words, a soft set over U is a mapping from parameters to P(U), and it is not a set, but a param- eterized family of subsets of U. For any parameter e A,F{A}(e) may be considered as the set of e- approximate elements of the soft set (F{A},E). For illustration, let us consider the following example. Example 1. Let U be the set of ve diseases (Vi- ral fever, Malaria, Typhoid, Gastric ulcer, Pneumo- nia) given by U = {d1,d2,d3,d4,d5} and E be the set of ve symptoms given by E= {Temperature, Headache, Stomach pain, Cough, Chest pain} ={s1,s2,s3,s4,s5}. Let A = {s1,s2,s3} E. Now consider that F{A} is a mapping given by, F{A} (s1) = {d1,d2}, F{A} (s2) = {d1,d3}, F{A} (s3) = {d2,d4}. Then the soft set (F{A},E) = {(s1,d1,d2), (s2,d1,d3),(s3,{d2,d4}),(s4,{/0}),(s5,{/0}). A fuzzy soft set can also be represented in the form of a two dimensional table. Table 1, given below, represents the soft set (F{A},E). Table 1.

Let FS(U) denotes the set of all fuzzy sets of U and A E. A pair ( F{A},E ) is called a fuzzy soft set (FSS) [19] over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by F{A} : E FS(U) such that F{A}(e) = /0if e / A where /0 is null fuzzy set. A fuzzy soft set is a parameterized family of fuzzy subsets of U. Its universe is the set of all fuzzy sets of U, i.e., FS(U). A fuzzy soft set can be con- sidered a special case of a soft set because it is still a mapping from parameters to a universe. The dif- ference between fuzzy soft set and soft set is that in a fuzzy soft set, the universe to be considered is the set of fuzzy subsets of U. Example 2. Let U and E remain same as in Ex- ample 1. Here A = {s1,s2,s3,s5} E. Let F{A} (s1) = {d1/0.2,d2/0.4,d3/0.9,d4/0.7}, F{A} (s2) = {d2/0.8,d3/0.1,d4/0.7}, F{A} (s3) = {d1/0.6,d2/0.2,d3/0.8}, and F{A} (s5) = {d1/0.6,d2/0.7,d3/0.5,d4/0.8}. Then the fuzzy soft set is given by ( F{A},E) = (s1,{d1/0.2,d2/0.4,d3/0.9,d4/0.7}), (s2,{d2/0.8,d3/0.1,d4/0.7}), (s3,{d1/0.6,d2/0.2,d3/0.8}), ( s4,{ /0} ) , (s5,{d1/0.6,d2/0.7,d3/0.5,d4/0.8}) . Tabular representation of the fuzzy soft set ( F{A},E) is shown in Table 2. 60 ( F{A},E) = (s1,{d1/(0.2,0.5),d2/(0.4,0.3),d3/(0.9,0.1),d4/(0.7,0.2)}), (s2,{d2/(0.8,0.2),d3/(0.1,0.8),d4/(0.7,0.2)}), (s3,{d1/(0.6,0.3),d2/(0.2,0.6),d3/(0.8,0.1)}), ( s4, /0 ) , (s5,{d1/(0.6,0.1),d2/(0.7,0.2),d3/(0.5,0.2),d4/(0.8,0.2)}) . Then the IFSS is given below. Tambouratzis T., Souliou D., Chalikias M., Gregoriades A.

Let IFS (U) denotes the set of all intuitionistic fuzzy sets of U and A E. A pair ( F{A},E) is called an intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IFSS) [22] over U, where F{A} is a mapping given by, F{A} : E IFS(U) so that F{A}(e) = /0 if e / A, where /0 is null intuitionistic fuzzy set, i.e., the membership value of x, (x) = 0; the non- membership value of x, (x) = 1 and the indeter- ministic part of x, (x) = 0, x /0.

Let us take 61 MAXIMISING ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY OF. . . 2.4 Interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft set (IVIFSS) Let U be an initial universe and E be a set of parameters. IVIF(U) denotes the set of all interval- valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets of U. Let A E. A pair ( F{A},E) is an IVIFSS [26] over U, where F{A} is a mapping, given by F{A} (s1) = { d1/ ( (0.2,0.4) (0.5,0.6) ) ,d2/ ( (0.4,0.5) (0.3,0.4) ) ,d3/ ( (0.7,0.8) (0.1,0.2) ) d4/ ( (0.6,0.7) (0.2,0.3) )} , F{A} (s2) = { d2/ ( (0.6,0.8) (0.1,0.2) ) ,d3/ ( (0.1,0.2), (0.7,0.8) ) ,d4/ ( (0.5,0.7) (0.2,0.3) )} , F{A} (s3) = { d1/ ( (0.6,0.7) (0.2,0.3) ) ,d2/ ( (0.2,0.3) (0.6,0.7) ) ,d3/ ( (0.6,0.8) (0.1,0.2) )} , and F{A} (s5) = { d1/ ( (0.6,0.7) (0.1,0.2) ) ,d2/ ( (0.5.0.7) (0.2,0.3) ) ,d3/ ( (0.4,0.6) (0.2,0.3) ) ,d4/ ( (0.7,0.8) (0.1,0.2) )} . F{A} : E IVIF(U). An IVIFSS is a parameterized family of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy subsets of U. Thus, its universe is the set of all interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets of U, i.e., IVIF(U). A, F( ) is an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set of U. F( ) is expressed as: F( ) = {< x,[ l F( )(x), r F( )(x)],[ l F( )(x), r F( )(x)] > |x X}. ( ( ( ) ( ) Example 4. Let U, A and E are same as in Example 3.

Let E be a set of parameters andA E. Table 4.

[ l FA(e)(u), r FA(e)(u)] and [ l F{A}(e)(u), r F{A}(e)(u)] are respectively the interval- valued intuitionistic fuzzy membership and non- membership degrees of the object u associated with the parameter e. Let U = {x1,x2,...,xm} and E = {e1,e2,...,en}. For simplicity, if we take the [ij]th entry of the relation then the matrix is de ned as [ aij]m n = a11 a12 a1n a21 a22 a2n ... ... ... ... am1 am2 amn . The above matrix is called an IVIFSM [32] of order m n corresponding to the IVIFSS ( F{A},E) over U. Example 5. The IVIFSM corresponding to Example 4 is given below. Then a subset of U E is uniquely de ned by RA = {(u,e) : e A,u F{A}(e)},which is called a relation of ( F{A},E). The membership function of RA is written as RA : U E Int([0,1]) and de- ned by F as aij = [{ l F{A}(ej)(xi), r F{A}(ej)(xi)},{ l F{A}(ej)(xi), r F{A}(e j)(xi)}], 63 MAXIMISING ACCURACY AND EFFICIENCY OF. . . of the decision makers.

Then A and are said to be con- formable for the product ( A ) and their prod- uct ( A ) is called product IVIFSM. The product ( A ) is also denoted simply by A . 3.1 Choice Matrix and Combined Choice Matrix Choice Matrix is a square matrix whose rows and columns both indicate parameters. If is a choice matrix, then its element (i, j) is de ned as follows: If A = [ ai j]m n and = [ jk]n p, then A = [ cik]m p, cik = [maxn j=1 min{ l aij, l jk},maxn j=1 min{ r aij, r jk}], [minn j=1 min{ l aij, l jk},minn j=1 min{ r aij, r jk}] . where Example 6. Example for the product of IVIFSM and combined choice matrix is shown in Step 5 of both the case studies, explained in Section 6. 64 3.3 Addition of IVIFSMs Two IVIFSMs A and B are said to be con- formable for addition, if they have the same order Tambouratzis T., Souliou D., Chalikias M., Gregoriades A. and after addition, the sum is also an IVIFSM of the same order. Now if both A = ( aij) and B = ( bij) be the same order m n, then the addition of A and B is denoted by A B and is de ned by Example 7. Example for the addition operation is shown in Step 6 of of both the case studies, ex- plained in Section 6. 3.4 Complement of IVIFSM Complement of an IVIFSM ( aij)m n is denoted by ( aij)c m n,where ( aij)m nis the matrix representa- tion of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft set ( F{A},E). ( aij)c m n is the matrix representation of the interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft set ( Fc {A},E)and is de ned as [ cij] = [ ai j] [ bij], where cij = { [ max { l aij, l bij}, max { r aij, r bij}], [ min { l aij, l bij}, min { r ai j, r bi j}] } i, j. 4 Cardinal Set of IVIFSS and Car- dinal Score The cardinal set of IVIFSS ( F{A},E) is denoted by (c F{A},E) and de ned by ( ai j)c m n = [( l aij )c , ( r aij )c] , [( l aij )c , ( r aij )c] = [1 r ai j,1 l ai j],[1 r ai j,1 l ai j]. (c F{A},E) = {[ l c F{A}(x), r c F{A}(x)],[ l c F{A}(x), r c F{A}(x)]}x : x E}. It is an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set over E. The membership function [ l c F{A}(x), r c F{A}(x)] and non-membership function [ l c F{A}(x), r c F{A}(x)] of (c F{A},E) are respectively de ned by l c F{A}(x) = d U l F{A}(d) |U| , r c F{A}(x) = d U r F{A}(d) |U| x E l c F{A}(x) = d U l F{A}(d) |U| , r c F{A}(x) = d U r F{A}(d) |U| x E. and 65 Table 5.

Step 1: Opinions of a set of experts / decision makers P = {p1, p2,..., pk} for a given set of alter- natives D = {d1,d2,...,dm} and a set of attributes S = {s1,s2,...,sn} are represented using interval- valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrices. Step 2: Cardinal matrix of each IVIFSM is ex- plored and then cardinal score is computed. Step 3: Cardinal score is multiplied with the cor- responding IVIFSM to produce the normalized IV- IFSM. Let [ a(i j) ] m n be an IVIFSM and cardi- nal score is h, then the normalized IVIFSM, de- noted by NIVIFSM, is de ned byNIVIFSM[ a(ij)] = [ h a(ij) ] m n ,for i = 1,2,...,m and j = 1,2,...,n. Step 4: Choice matrix (i, j)Pand combined choice matrix (i, j)PC of each of the decision makersP = {p1, p2,..., pk} are computed in the con- text of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set based on their choice parameters / attributes. Step 5: Product IVIFSM (PIVIFSM) for each deci- sion maker is calculated by multiplying the normal- ized IVIFSMwith its combined choice matrix. Step 7: Weight W(di) of each alternative di{i = 1,2,...,m} is estimated by adding the membership and non-membership values of the entries of the re- spective row (ith row). Step 8: di D, compute the score S(di) of di, such that, S(di) = {( l i l i)+( r i r i)}/2, di D i. Step 9: If S(di) > S(dj) dj D, then alternativediis selected. If j, such that,S(di) = S(dj), where i = j for highest score value, then de- cision is made according to their accuracy values as described in step 10. Step 10: Accuracy value H(di), i = 1,2,...,m, is de ned as H(di) = {( l i + l i)+( r i + r i)}/2, di D i. If H(di) > H(dj) j for which S(di) = S(dj), de- ned in Step 9, alternative di is selected. If H(di) = H(dj)for any j, then di and d j both are selected. Tambouratzis T., Souliou D., Chalikias M., Gregoriades A.

Patients belong- ing to Stage I are assumed not to be affected by heart disease. Patients belonging to Stage II are in initial stage, patients belonging to Stage III are in more unsafe stage than in stage II and so on. Patients belonging to Stage V are in the last stage of heart disease which is unrecoverable. Let E be the set of ve symptoms (Chest pain, Palpitations, Dizziness, Fainting, Fatigue) given by E = {s1,s2,s3,s4,s5}. Suppose that a group of three experts P = {p1, p2, p3} are monitoring the symptoms of a patient as per their knowledgebase to reach a consensus about which stage is more likely to appear for the patient, where expert p1 is aware of symptoms (s1, s2, s3, s4), p2 is aware of symptoms (s1s2,s3,s5), and p3 is aware of symptoms (s1,s2,s4,s5).

[Step 7] Now the weights of various stages of heart disease W(di),i = 1,2,...,5 are calculated as fol- lows: W(d1) = [0.34+0.34+0.13+0.34+0.22, 0.48+0.48+0.29+0.48+0.30], [0.04+0.04+0.04+0.14+0.04, 0.09+0.09+0.13+0.20+0.09] = = [ [1.37,2.03], [0.3,0.6] ] . Similarly, W(d2) = [ [1.31,2.08], [0.3,0.53] ] , W(d3) = [ [1.82,2.2], [0.28,0.66] ] , W(d4) = [ [1.36,2.07], [0.27,0.54] ] , W(d5) = [ [1.11,1.91], [0.43,0.88] ] . [Step 8] Scores of various stages of heart disease are computed as follows: S(d1) = {(1.37 0.3)+(2.03 0.6)}/2 = 1.25 S(d2) = {(1.31 0.3)+(2.08 0.53)}/2 = 1.28 S(d3) = {(1.82 0.28)+(2.2 0.66)}/2 = 1.54 S(d4) = {(1.36 0.27)+(2.07 0.54)}/2 = 1.31 S(d5) = {(1.11 0.43)+(1.91 0.88)}/2 = 0.86 [Step 9] Since score of d3 is maximum, the patient under consideration belongs to Stage III as per the collective opinions of the group of experts. 7 Discussion of Results This study proposes a decision making method- ology under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy en- vironment, where a con dent weight is assigned to each of the experts based on prescribed opinion. The con dent weight for each expert is computed by deriving the cardinal score of their correspond- ing IVIFSSs. The opinion of an expert with more cardinal score is more important than others and consequently the opinion of that expert contributes a vital role in decision making process. When an expert is more con dent about her opinion, more cardinal score is assigned to that expert. Due to lack of information or limited domain knowledge, experts often prefer to express their opinions only for a subset of attributes instead of the entire at- tribute set. In that case, cardinal score will be more when an expert provides opinion about more num- ber of attributes and less when she provides opinion about less number of attributes. This is very much similar to our real life situations. This also removes the biasness and adds more credibility to the nal decision. Our algorithm does not use any medical knowledgebase, so it does not depend on the cor- rectness of the knowledgebase. We give more im- portance on the parameter selection of experts by nding initial choice matrices and then combined choice matrix. We rely on experts opinions and then investigate the collective opinion by a system- atic procedure based on cardinal matrix. As our approach is guided by a con dent weight assign- ing mechanism, so chances of biasing is less in our model. Among two cases, Case 1 does not use the con dent weight, while Case 2 uses it. As per col- lective opinion of a group of experts, the ordering of the diseases, i.e., stages of heart disease is given be- low in Table 6. The result shows different ordering in second case as we have considered the experts con dent weights. Case I produces the nal out- come as d2, i.e., stage II of heart disease and Case II produces d3, i.e., stage III of heart disease as per the collective opinion. Table 6. Ordering of diseases in different cases Case I d2 > d3 > d4 > d1 > d5 Case II d3 > d4 > d2 > d1 > d5 8 Conclusion This article has proposed an algorithmic ap- proach for multiple attribute group decision making using IVIFSM based on con dent weight assigning mechanism of experts. Firstly, we have presented IVIFSM and some of its relevant operations. Next we have proposed the con dent weight assigning mechanism of experts using cardinal score in the context of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy en- vironment. Our proposed algorithm is based on combined choice matrix, product IVIFSM, cardi- nal matrix, score function, and accuracy function, 76 Tambouratzis T., Souliou D., Chalikias M., Gregoriades A. which yields the collective opinion of a group of decision makers. Another important aspect of this study is that we have not used the concept of medi- cal knowledgebase in our decision making process. The case study is related with medical diagnosis, where we have used opinions of a group of experts about a common set of symptoms. IVIFSM has been used to represent the opinions. We have per- formed a comparative analysis in the case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of using weight as- signing procedure. Future scope of this research work might be to investigate the application of ro- bustness in MAGDM in the framework of IVIFSS. Also researchers might focus on various properties of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy soft matrix and then apply them to suitable uncertain decision making problems. References [1] D.
