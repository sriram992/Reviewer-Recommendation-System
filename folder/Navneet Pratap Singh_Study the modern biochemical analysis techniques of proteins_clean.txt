The amino acids in a polypeptide chain are linked by peptide bonds. Once linked in the protein chain, an individual amino acid is called a residue, and the linked series of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen atoms are known as the main chain are protein backbone .The end of the protein with a free carboxyl group is known as the C-terminus or carboxyl terminus, whereas the end with a free amino group is known as the N-terminus or amino terminus. Keywords: Proteins, Amino acids, Protein chains, Biochemical analysis, Enzymes etc. _____________________________________________________________________________________________ INTRODUCTION Protein Proteins are organic compound made of amino acids arranged in a linear chain and joined together by peptide bonds between the carboxyl and amino groups of adjacent amino acids residues. The sequence of amino acids in a protein is defined by the sequence of a gene, which is encoded in the genetic code. Like other biological macromolecules such as polysaccharides and nucleic acids, proteins are essentials parts of organisms and participate in virtually every process with in cell. Proteins were first described and named by the Swedish chemist Jons Jakob Berzelius in 1838. However, the central role of proteins in living organisms was note fully appreciated until 1926, when James B. Sumer showed that the enzyme urease was a protein. The first protein to be sequence was insulin, by Frederick Sanger, who one the Nobel Prize for this achievement in 1958.[1] Protein Synthesis Proteins are assembled from amino acids using information encoded genes. Each protein has its own unique amino acids sequence that is specified by nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding this protein. The genetic code is a set of three nucleotide sets called codons and each three nucleotide combination designates amino acids, for example AUG (Adenine- uracil- guanine) is the code for methionine. Because DNA contains four nucleotides, the total number of possible codons is 64; hence, there is some redundancy in the genetic code, with some amino acids specified by more than one codon. Genes encoded in DNA in first transcribed into pre-mRNA by proteins such as RNA polymerase. The process of synthesizing apple protein from an mRNA template is known as translation. The mRNA is loaded on to the ribosome and is read three nucleotides at a time by matching each codon to its base Navneet Kumar Verma et al J. Microbiol. Biotech. Res., 2015, 5 (1):45-55 ______________________________________________________________________________ 46 Available online at www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com pairing anticodon located on a transfer RNA molecule, which carries the amino acid corresponding to the codon it recognizes. Protein is always biosynthesize from N-terminus to C-terminus. [2] Structure of proteins Most proteins fold into unique 3-dimensional structures. The shape into which a protein naturally folds is known as its native conformation. Secondary structure: regularly repeating local structures stabilized by hydrogen bonds. The most common examples are the alpha helix and beta sheet. Tertiary structure: the overall shape of a single protein molecule; the spatial relationship of the secondary structure to one another. Tertiary structure is generally stabilized by non local interactions, most commonly the formation of a hydrophobic core, but also through salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, disulfide bonds, and even post-translation modifications. Quarternary structures: the structure that results from the interaction of more then one protein molecule , usually called protein subunits in this context ,which function as part of the larger assembly or protein complex . Cellular functions Proteins are the chief actors within in the cell, said to be carrying out the duties specified by the information encoded in genes. The chief characteristic of proteins that also allows their diverse set of function is their ability to bind other molecules specifically and tightly. The region of the protein responsible for binding another molecule is knows as the binding site and is often a depression or pocket on the molecular surface. Structural proteins Most structural proteins are fibrous protein; for example, actin and tubulin are globular and soluble as monomers, but polymerise to form long , stiff fibers that comprise the cytoskeleton , which allows the cell to maintain its shape and size . Collagen and elastin are critical components of connective tissue such as cartilage, and keratin is found in hard or filamentous structures such as hair , nails, feathers ,hooves and some animal shells. Protein purification In order to perform in vitro analysis, apple protein must be purified away from other cellular components. This process usually begins with cell lysis. in which a cell s membrane is disrupted and its internal contents released into a solution known as crude lysate. The resulting mixture can be purified using ultracentrifugation , which fractionates the various cellular components into fraction containing soluble protein ; membrane lipid and proteins ;cellular organelles, and nucleic acid .Precipitation by a method known as salting out can concentrate the protein from this lysate. Various types of chromatography are then used to isolate the protein or proteins of interest based on properties such as molecular weight, net charge and binding affinity. The level of purification can be monitored using various types gel electrophoresis if the desired protein s molecular weight and isoelectric point are known, by spectroscopy if the protein has distinguishable spectroscopic features, or by enzyme assays if the protein has enzymatic activity .Additionally proteins can be isolated according their charge using electro focusing. [3] Cellular localization The study of protein in vitro is often concern with the synthesis and localization of the protein with in the cell. Although many intracellular proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm and membrane- bound or secreted proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, the specifies of how proteins are targeted to specific organelles or cellular structures is often unclear. Apple useful technique for assessing cellular localization uses genetic engineering to express in a cell apple fusion protein or chimera consisting of the natural protein of interest linked to a reporter such as GFP (green fluorescent protein). The fused protein s position within the cell can be cleanly and efficiently visualized using microcopy, as shown in the figure opposite. In these cases, additional fluorescent chimeric proteins are generally required to prove the inferred localization. Nutrition Most microorganisms and plants can biosynthesize all 20 standard amino acids, while animals (including humans) must obtain some amino acids from the diet. In animals, amino acids are obtained through the consumption of foods containing protein. Ingested proteins are broken down through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of Navneet Kumar Verma et al J. Microbiol. Biotech. Res., 2015, 5 (1):45-55 ______________________________________________________________________________ 47 Available online at www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some ingested amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis. Types of proteins Based upon chemical composition, proteins are divided into two major classes: simple proteins, which are composed of only amino acids, and conjugated protein, which are composed of amino acids and additional organic and inorganic groupings, certain of which are called prosthetic groups. Conjugated proteins include glycoprotein, which contain carbohydrates; lipoproteins, which contain lipids; and nucleoproteins, which contain nucleic acids. Protease A protease is any enzyme that conducts proteolysis, that is, begins protein catabolism by hydrolysis of the peptide bond that linked amino acids together in the polypeptide chain, which form molecule of protein. Occurrence Proteases occur naturally in all organisms. These enzymes are involved in apple multitude of physiological reaction from simple digestion of food protein to highly- regulated cascades (e.g., the blood- clotting cascade). Bacteria also secrete proteases to hydrolyse the peptide bonds in proteins and therefore break the proteins down into their constituent monomers. Proteases are also a type of exotin, which is virulence factor in bacteria pathogenesis. Bacteria exotoxic proteases destroy extra cellular structures. Protease enzymes are also used extensively in the bread industry in bread improver. [4] Inhibitors The function of peptidases is inhibited by protease inhibiter enzyme. Examples of protease inhibiters are the class of serpins (serine protease or peptidase inhibiters), incorporating alpha 1- antitrypsin. Other serpins are complement 1- inhibiter, antithrombin, alpha 1- antichymotrypsin, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 and the recently discovered neuroserpin. Peroxidase Peroxidase (EC number 1.11.1x) are a large family of enzymes that typically catalyzed a reaction of the form: ROOR + electron donor (2e) + 2H ROH + R OH For many of these enzymes the optimal substrates the hydrogen peroxide, but others are more active with organic hydro peroxides such as lipid peroxides. Peroxidases can contain a heme cofactor in their active sites, or redox- active cysteine or selenocysteine residus. Application Peroxidase can be used for treatment of industrial waste water. For examples, phenols, which are important pollutants, can be removed by enzyme catalized polymerization using horseradish peroxides. Thus phenols are oxidized to phenoxy radicals which participate in reactions where produced polymers are and oligomers that are less toxic than phenols.[5] Acid phosphatase Acid phosphatase is a phosphatase, a type of enzyme, used to free attached phosphste groups from other molecules during digestion. It is basically a phosphomonoesterase. Different forms of acid phosphatase are found in different organs, and their serum levels are used as a diagnostic for disease in the corresponding organs. Acid phosphatase catalyzes the following reaction at an optimal pH below 7. Phosphatase enzymes are also used by soil microorganisms to access organically bound phosphate nutrients.[6] Alkaline phosphatase Alkaline phosphatase is a hydrolase enzyme responsible roe removing phosphate groups from many types of molecules, including nucleotides, protein, and alkaloids. The process of removing the phosphate group is called dephosphorylation. In bacteria, alkaline phosphatase is located in the periplasmic space, external to the cell membrane. Since this space is much more subject to phosphatase is comparatively resistant to inactivation, denaturation, and degradation, and also has a higher rate of activity. Alkaline phosphatase has become useful tool in molecular biology laboratories, since DNA normally possesses hen groups on the 5 end. Removing these phosphates prevents the DNA from ligating, thereby keeping DNA molecules linear until the next step of the Navneet Kumar Verma et al J. Microbiol. Biotech. Res., 2015, 5 (1):45-55 ______________________________________________________________________________ 48 Available online at www.scholarsresearchlibrary.com process for which they are being prepared; also, removal of the phosphate groups allows radio labeling in order to measure the presence of the labeled DNA through further steps in the process. One common use in the dairy is as a maker of pasteurization in cow s milk. The molecule is denatured by elevated temperatures found during pasteurization, and can be tested for via colour change of a para-nitro-phenol phosphate substrate in a buffered solution. Raw milk would typically produce a yellow colouration within a couple of minutes, whereas properly pasteurized milk should no change.[7] Inhibitors All mammalian alkaline phosphatase isoenzymes except placental are inhibited by homoarginine and similarly all except the intestinal and placental ones are blocked by levamisole. Heating for~ 2 hours at 650 C inactivated most isoenzymes except placental isoforms.

Protein Electrophoresis Protein Electrophoresis is a relatively simple, rapid and highly sensitive tool to study the properties of proteins. It is the principle tool in analytical chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology. The separation of proteins by electrophoresis is based on the fact that charged molecules will migrate through a matrix upon application of an electrical field. The matrix for protein electrophoresis separation is polyacrylamide.[3] MATERIALS FOR EACH GROUP Each group (of 4 students) is supplied with the following components. 2.2ml 40% Acryl amide/ Bis-acrylamide solution, 150 l 10% Ammonium Per sulfate, 1.5ml 10% Detergent solution (SDS), 0.7mL Stacking Gel Buffer, 2.2ml Separating Gel Buffer, 15 l TEMED, 10 l Protein Standard Marker, 25 l 2x Sample Loading Buffer, 25 l Chicken Liver Extract, 600 ml 1x Electrophoresis Running Buffer, 50 ml Lab Safe Gel Stain, 2 .15 ml Graduated tubes with cap for each group , 2 blotting paper sheets and 6 ml Water.
