INTRODUCTION There are wide varieties of storage systems, for instance, compressed air energy storage, electrochemical battery energy storage systems (BESSs), pumped storage hydroelectric systems, hydrogen storage, ywheel energy storage, thermal energy storage, supercapacitors, cryogenic energy storage, liquid metal batteries, pumped thermal electricity storage and superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) systems. Each storage system is associated with pros and cons. BESS is considered very less because of its voltage and current limitations. Further, the chemicals were used in the manufacturing of batteries, which adversely affect the environment. Also, pumped storage hydroelectric systems depend up on its geographical locations. Hence, it may not be suitable for applications that used in day-to-day life. By overcoming all these limitations, SMES has a capability to store electric energy. The versatile and potential applications of SMES can be found in electrical energy and power systems. The principle of operation of an SMES is when a direct current (DC) voltage is applied across the terminals of a coil, energy will be stored. The current in the coil will continue to ow even after voltage source has been removed. This is because when a superconductor is cooled less than its critical temperature, the coil attains a very less resistance that is negligible, due to which energy will be stored by generated magnetic eld due to its inherent current. The energy can be discharged by its discharging coil. SMES can transit from its full-charge state to full discharge state at high speed vice versa, due to which the ef ciency of SMES are very high compared with normal coils. Generally, SMES has very quick self-discharge because of its self-cooling via cryogenic liquid. The general components of SMES are shown in Figure 1. It mainly consists of three parts: (i) low- temperature/high-temperature superconducting coil magnet, (ii) cryogenic refrigerator and (iii) helium/nitrogen liquid. This article is mainly focussed on the application of SMES in electrical power and energy systems. This article is composed with ve sections. First section gives a brief introduction about SMES. Second section deals with various applications of SMES in microgrid (MG). Further section deals with application of SMES in electrical vehicle (EV) systems. Section 4 deals with its application on renewable energy resources, and nally, it is provided with conclusive remarks with its future perspective that is given in Section 5.

APPLICATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETIC ENERGY STORAGE IN MICROGRID 2.1. Superconducting magnetic energy storage coil The SMES consists of an extremely conductive coil attached to the grid by means of a power conditioning systems [1]. This acts as a constant current source and allows energy to be stored for longer duration of time without leakage and acts as a backup to inject power in the grid in case of any disturbance. The overall performance of the SMES depends on the precise con guration of these superconductive coils. The design and selection of the coil for SMES consists of two stages [2]: coil geometry decision and optimization. 2.2. Coil shape and design The selection of the coil geometry in SMES is considered on the basis of factors such as stray eld and available conductor length and the strain tolerance. Depending upon these criteria, there are various types of coil geometry for SMES reported till date. The three general coil geometries used are solenoid and toroid [3]. Here, various con gurations of these coils are presented for comparison. In particular, the eld orientation effects on the critical current and the effects on the total energy storage are examined. 2.3. Solenoid geometry and optimization In comparison with toroid geometry, the solenoid geometry of the coil is simpler, can bear more mechanical stress and requires minimum wire consumption and is most cost effective solution [4]. Irrespective of high stray elds, solenoid geometry is successful for SMES for low- temperature superconductor and for small SMES as they do not need precompression and easy to coil [5,6]. Although the conventional shape of the solenoid coil is rectangular, a coil with step-shaped cross section consists of a count of coaxial coils with different lengths. This con guration is illustrated in [7]. A thin solenoid coil of height h and radius R , with aspect ratio = h/2R has proved to be promising geometry for storage. The superconductor for this kind of geometry is given by [8,9] Qsc Cs E2=3B1=3; (1) where s refers to solenoid. The stored energy per unit of conductor is given as Ks E=Qsc Cs 1E1=3B1=3: (2) The results on the stored energy for the aspect ratio 0.001 and 1.0 are given later in Table I [10]. 2.4. Toroid geometry Whenever the 2G high-temperature superconductor (HTS) materials are considered, toroid geometry is given preference. The toroid geometry reduces the perpendicular component of the magnetic eld on the conductor, which means less stray elds and presumably lower alternating current (AC) loss hence no requirement of shielding. The toroidal coils can be arranged in two ways: rst, as a continuous helical winding called helical toroids, or second, as a number of short solenoids connected in series called modular toroids [11,12]. The helical toroids can be further classi ed on two new methods of helical winding, that is, the force-balanced coil [11] and the stress-balanced coil [13]. The stress-balanced coil is an improved design of force-balanced coil and is designed to balance the aspect ratio of coils. These designs can counterbalance high electromagnetic forces generated because of high magnetic elds and currents in the SMES. The virial theorem can optimize the structure of a helical coil and can reduce the SMES structure mass by 75% of toroidal eld coil storing similar energy. The Stress-Balanced Coil (SBC) can achieve the SMES design with a superconductor of about 17% of the ampere metres of the total toroidal eld coil for the same amount of energy [12]. The modular design uses short modules of solenoid connected in series and placed symmetrically. The number of small toroids in uences design consideration as well as fabrication and hence ascertain feasibility of design. There are two methods used to optimize the SMES design parameters (magnetic energy, amount of superconductor and device volume): rst, an object weighting method, and second, a fuzzy logic method [14,15]. Both the methods use both stray eld and critical currents as constraints. This analysis Figure 1. General components of superconducting magnetic energy storage.

Figure 1 represents a modular toroid con guration. Out of helical and modular coil, the helical coil has an advantage of completely enclosed magnetic eld, while the modular coil leaks magnetic eld outside its structure. This problem was solved by using two new coil con gurations for SMES. The rst one is torroid structure consisting of D-shaped solenoids with D coil lling the gaps between the circular coils. The second con guration is an n-polygon group, which comprise of D-shaped cross section. Both the designed worked well in n = 4 polygon system as shown in Figure 3 and performed well in terms of energy storage and magnetic leakage [65]. Fundamental equations and relations between inductance and coil geometry and energy stored are given as follows [3]: The inductance of a toroidal coil is given by L R 1  1  b2 p ; (3) where b is the ratio of minor radius to the major radius R. For a total current, It, the stored energy is E R=2 1  1  b2 p It 2: (4) The maximum eld is Bm It=2R 1  b2   :  (5) And the quantity of the conductor required for the coil is Qsc 2 aI2 t 2 RbIt; (6) which can expressed in terms of the energy and eld Qsc 2 RbI4=3 t =I1=3 t (7) 16 2b3= 1  b 1  1  b2 p  2  1=3 E2=3B1=3 Cp b E2=3B1=3: Solving for K = E/Q, Kp 1  b 1  1  b2 p  2 16 2b3  1=3 E1=3B1=3: (8) The values of E/Qsc are given in Table II for b in the range 0.05 to 0.8. Microgrid sources such as wind energy system, solar photovoltaic (PV) systems, fuel cell (FC) sources and diesel generators have been anticipated as vital components for serving rural area even without grid connection. The gure explaining the MG is shown in Figure 2. However, the important problem associated with these sources is intermittent power outputs, which may cause instability in power system. To overcome, the power uctuations, the SMES may be better alternative that can diminish the stability problems. However, there are some concerns about the reliability problems for SMES [16]. In [16], these concerns were addressed. The reliability of SMES was addressed by a fuzzy logic-based current control strategy. The Current in SMES will be obtained by nding the energy in the circuit. Further, the same type of fuzzy logic controller in conjunction with SMES for grid-connected wind energy system was put forward. Perhaps, the dynamic performance of the grid-connected wind energy systems was not properly demonstrated in [17]. To overcome this, in [18], a hysteresis controlling scheme combined with fuzzy logic was introduced. The basic controlling scheme is shown in Figure 2. In this scheme, the magnetic eld will be generated because of current passing through the coil, due to which energy will be stored in the superconducting coil. The energy from SMES will be exchanged through the DC DC converter and DC AC inverter. In this scheme, SMES is used in conjunction with voltage source converter to have better self-commutating capability. The DC DC converter switching is decided by fuzzy logic control scheme, and its current and voltage control was given by hysteresis controller [18]. With this approach, small and large disturbances at grid side are drastically reduced. Introduction of SMES in MG system enhances the voltage and power quality [19]. DC DC converter is a static power electronic circuit, which is used to convert the DC voltage from one level to other. Mainly, there are ve versions of DC DC converters such as, buck (step-down), boost (step-up), buck boost (step-down/up), Cuk (step-up/down) and Sepic (step- down/up) converters. Various control mechanisms such as hysteresis controllers, pulse-width-modulated controllers, fuzzy logic-based controllers, adaptive controller, arti cial neural network-based controllers and sliding mode control schemes have been applied to DC DC converter to achieve its best voltage regulation in Table II.

One important such implementation strategy is shown in Figure 3. The important application of SMES in MG is to enhance its frequency regulation, power delivery and power quality in its voltage and current waveforms. The basic MG system with 1.6 MJ SME is connected with 3-MVA wind farm connected to a bus bar via 0.9/33-kV three-phase step-up transformer, which is then interconnected to PV system through a transformer of 0.9/33 kV. Also, a diesel generator of 20 MVA with its voltage rating of 11 kV is stepped up to 33 kV is connected to factory loads and is shown in Figure 1. The complete MG system has been implemented in MATLAB/Simulation with its hysteresis controlling scheme, and results have been enumerated later. The MG system with and without SMES has been executed, and results are depicted in Figure 4. The system is subjected to 10% sudden change in factory load, which affects the DC link voltage and is shown in Figure 4(a). The DC link voltage decreased from 26 to 25 kV, which subsequently affect the load current shown in Figure 4 (b), and its results are shown in Figure 4(c) and (d), respectively. Whereas system with SMES shows DC voltage to be constant maintained at 26 kV, and its AC currents are constant without any distortion. SMES nds many applications in wind energy systems, particularly in its stability point of view [17]. The SMES is applied to DC DC converter at the load side as well as at the terminal of wind generator. The functioning of SMES is veri ed with two control schemes, namely, sinusoidal pulse-width modulation scheme obtained by fuzzy logic controller and pitch control scheme. A new hysteresis control scheme has been implemented in conjunction with fuzzy control and is given in [18]. More of these kinds of SMES application found to double fed induction generators instead of xed speed wind generators due to its superior advantages [20]. Even in excitation systems of double- fed induction generators, SMES has been extensively used [21]. During power outages, SMES plays a vital to maintain the reactive power of connected systems, which is quite often in wind PV-connected MG system [22]. Also, in certain cases, voltage sag and voltage swell conditions are also ef ciently handled by the SMES system [23]. A further in implementation of MG system is injection of FC system. With the introduction in to PV wind-based system, due to its intermittent nature, a new control scheme with SMES have been applied and veri ed [13,24]. 3. APPLICATION OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETIC ENERGY STORAGE IN ELECTRICAL VEHICLE AND RENEWABLE ENERGY SYSTEM Electrical vehicles projected to be future for personal and commercial transportation, which then increases load requirement in MG that is uncertain. The abrupt power charging of EV results in load uctuations that subsequently introduce harmonics into the system. Many researches are focussed on the suitable control schemes for abrupt power charging when it connected to MG. Problem becomes more severe in MG due to intermittent power by PV and wind systems. Hence, there is a necessity to ll the gap between intermittent power by renewable sources and EV. Various superconducting energy schemes have been discussed in [25]. Figure 2. Structure of microgrid.

However, the system controllers mainly depend up on the DC DC converter and DC AC converter. The individual converter scheme is shown in Figure 5(b). Each inverter is controlled by its voltage and current controller. The output of the inverter is then connected to lter, which subsequently reduces the harmonics in the system. To analyse the stability of system, a small signal model has to be developed. 3.1. Small signal model of diesel generator The diesel generator consists of a diesel engine, valve actuator and speed control loop. Input to the model is load PL, that is, output power of the electrical generator. The transfer function of valve actuator, diesel engine and rotor swing equations could be written as follows: X 1 s X 2 s 1 1 STsm (9) Figure 5.

(2017) 2017 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. DOI: 10.1002/er given in Figure 6(d). The entire system has been integrated as shown in Figure 4(a) and tested MATLAB/Simulation environment, and its results are listed in Figure 7. The complete system nomenclature can be found in [13]. Various controller gains, for instance, proportional controller, integral controller and derivative controller, have been chosen at an optimum level with an objective to achieve best in performance at its voltage and current wave form and subsequently to minimize the total harmonic distortion. The system has been subjected to various sag and swell conditions with simultaneous abrupt charging of EV. MG system has been prone sag condition from 0.1 to 0.2 s and swell condition from 0.1 to 0.2 s. In the both cases, the output voltage and output current found constant and which were due to SMES. Finally, the total harmonic distortion of output voltage has also been tested and found with exciting 2.30% with all lower order harmonics eliminated. All these results are shown in Figure 7. The proposed system has been executed with and without SMES, and its results have been tabulated in Table II. From which, it is clear that system with SMES is able to reduce the harmonic content and able perform better with SMES. Superconducting magnetic energy storage has good control over the load conditions as well, and it is shown in Figure 8. As per load demand, the SMES participated in actively and able to maintain the load voltage as constant. Further, with the ability of control in voltage, it leads to less circulating currents. Mitigation of circulating currents leads to improvement of power transfer capability. 4. OTHER APPLICATIONS AND FUTURE PROSPECTUS OF SUPERCONDUCTING MAGNETIC ENERGY STORAGE The basic design of 10-kJ class SMES can be found in [26], high- led HTS SMES coil [27], 200-kJ 2G HTS solenoidal SMES coil can be found in [28], and their thermal and cooling design can be found in [29]. The SMES founds application in mitigating the wind energy system uctuations [30], voltage harmonics [31] and enhancing stability [32], and its modern prospectus applications are given in [33,34]. Robust controller schemes such as fuzzy logic, hysteresis, H-in nity and sliding mode control schemes have been applied to SMES in conjunction with voltage source converter in MG [32,35,36]. High power superconduction power station have been started and function at China [37]. Several power control schemes in conjunction with the SMES have been developed for frequency regulation, reactive power control, speed control and power charging [31,36,38 41]. In near future, SMES can acquire a very prominent place in EV system, space shuttles, satellites system and even in medical applications as well. (a) (b) (c) (d) Figure 8.
