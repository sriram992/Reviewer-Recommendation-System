Enrollment of patients of Black African ancestry with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in phase II and phase III of the belimumab trials was not re ective of the racial distribution observed in the lupus population. This study was undertaken to assess the ef cacy and safety of intravenous (IV) belimumab plus standard therapy in patients of self-identi ed Black race. Methods. EMBRACE (GSK Study BEL115471; ClinicalTrials.gov identi er: NCT01632241) was a 52-week multi- center, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in adults of self-identi ed Black race with active SLE who received monthly belimumab 10 mg/kg IV, or placebo, plus standard therapy. The optional 26-week open-label extension phase included patients who completed the double-blind phase. The primary end point of the study was SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 with modi ed proteinuria scoring adapted from the SLE Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) (SRI SLEDAI-2K). Key secondary end points included SRI response rate at week 52, time to rst severe SLE are, and reductions in prednisone dose. Results. The modi ed intent-to-treat population comprised 448 patients, of whom 96.9% were women and the mean  SD age was 38.8  11.42 years. The primary end point (improvement in the SRI SLEDAI-2K response rate at week 52) was not achieved (belimumab 48.7%, placebo 41.6%; odds ratio 1.40 [95% con dence interval 0.93, 2.11], P = 0.1068); however, numerical improvements favoring belimumab were observed, in which the SRI SLEDAI- 2K response rates were higher in those who received belimumab compared with those who received placebo, espe- cially in patients with SLE who had high disease activity or renal manifestations at baseline. The safety pro le of belimu- mab was generally consistent with that observed in previous SLE trials. Adverse events were the primary reasons for double-blind phase withdrawals (belimumab 5.4%, placebo 6.7%). Conclusion. The primary end point of this study was not achieved, but improvement with belimumab versus pla- cebo was observed, suggesting that belimumab remains a suitable treatment option for SLE management in patients of Black African ancestry.

Black African ancestry is associ- ated with a higher prevalence of SLE, greater disease severity, an increased risk of cardiovascular events, more end-organ dam- age, and higher mortality rates, compared with a White racial background (3 10). Belimumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity of the B lymphocyte stimulator, which plays a key role in B cell selection and differentiation (11,12). The ef cacy and safety of intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous belimumab have been demonstrated in phase II and III studies of SLE (13 16). Due to underrepresentation of patients of Black African ancestry in these trials, underpowered subgroup analy- ses of this population yielded con icting ef cacy data between the phase II and III studies. Post hoc analysis of the phase II study data demonstrated an improved Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Erythematosus National Assessment version of the SLE Disease Activity Index (SELENA SLEDAI) response in patients of Black African ancestry who received belimumab compared with those who received placebo (17). In contrast, post hoc analysis of pooled data from 2 pivotal phase III studies showed that patients of Black African ancestry had a higher SLE Responder Index (SRI) response rate at week 52 with placebo compared with belimumab (18). The 52-week EMBRACE study investigated the ef cacy and safety of belimumab 10 mg/kg IV plus standard therapy compared with placebo plus standard therapy in adults with SLE of self-identi ed Black race. This report presents results of the ef cacy and safety end point analyses from data col- lected up to the week 52 visit of the double-blind phase, and the subsequent 24-week open-label extension phase of EMBRACE. Additionally, results presented include subgroup analyses. PATIENTS AND METHODS Study design. EMBRACE (GSK Study BEL115471; ClinicalTrials.gov identi er: NCT01632241) was a phase III/IV, mul- ticenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 52-week study (Figure 1) conducted at 88 centers in Brazil, Colombia, France, South Africa, the UK, and the US. The study consisted of a screening phase of up to 5 weeks and a 52-week double-blind phase (date of initiation [ rst patient s rst visit] February 19, 2013; date of double-blind end point analysis June 18, 2018), followed by an optional 6-month open-label extension phase. Patients. Full selection criteria are provided in the Supple- mentary Material (available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/ abstract). Brie y, for inclusion in the double-blind phase, patients had to be age 18 years and of self-identi ed Black race, with a SELENA SLEDAI score of 8 at the time of screening and positiv- ity for antinuclear antibodies (titer 1:80 and/or anti double- stranded DNA [ 30 IU/ml]). Key exclusion criteria included previ- ous treatment with belimumab, severe lupus kidney disease or active nephritis, or central nervous system lupus. All patients provided written informed consent prior to enroll- ment. Approval was obtained for all study sites from the ethics com- mittee or institutional review board (IRB) (IRB HGS1006-C1112/ tracking QUI1-12-249). The study was conducted in accordance with the ethics principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (19), the International Council for Harmonisation Guidelines for Good Clinical Practice, and any applicable country-speci c regulatory SCREENING Day -35 to Day 0 Placebo Belimumab 10 mg/kg IV RANDOMIZATION Stratify by: 1.

The reporting of this study conforms to the Consoli- dated Standards of Reporting Trials 2010 guidelines (20). Randomization and treatment. Using an interactive voice/web response system, patients receiving standard therapy were randomized 2:1 to receive either belimumab 10 mg/kg IV or placebo, which was administered on days 0, 14, and 28 and every 28 days thereafter up to week 48, with a nal evaluation at week 52. Randomization was strati ed by screening SELENA SLEDAI score ( 9 versus 10), region (US/Canada versus rest of world), and complement level ( 1 test nding showing low C3/ C4 [less than the lower limit of normal] versus C3/C4 other [the lower limit of normal or above]). Detailed randomization data are provided in Supplementary Material (http://onlinelibrary.wiley. com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/abstract). Patients who successfully completed the initial 52-week double-blind phase could enter an optional 6-month open-label extension phase, during which they received belimumab 10 mg/kg IV every 28 days plus standard therapy, irrespective of their previ- ous study assignment. The rst dose was given at the week 52 (day 364) visit of the double-blind period (day 1 of the open-label extension phase). Patients who completed the 52-week double- blind phase, but did not enter the 6-month open-label extension phase, were required to return for an additional follow-up visit 8 weeks after their last dose. Patients who withdrew early were required to return for an exit visit 4 weeks after their last dose and a follow-up visit 8 weeks after their last dose. The original protocol plan was to randomize 816 patients, providing 90% power to detect 12% absolute improvement in the SRI response rate in the belimumab group compared with the placebo group at a 5% signi cance level. Due to enrollment challenges, a revised sample size was calculated to include 501 patients ( 334 patients in the belimumab group and 167 patients in the placebo group). This sample size provided 90% power to detect a minimum 15.55% absolute improvement in SRI SLEDAI-2K response rate in the belimumab group relative to the placebo group at a 5% signi cance level (based on the pooled data from ef cacy studies BEL112341 and BEL113750) (15,21). These calculations assumed a placebo response rate of 43.95% at week 52. Study end points and assessments. The primary ef - cacy end point was the SRI SLEDAI-2K response rate (de ned in the Supplementary Material) at week 52 of the double-blind phase. Unlike in the phase II and phase III studies, the SRI SLEDAI-2K was selected because of the simpli cation it offers in proteinuria assessment as compared with the SELENA SLEDAI proteinuria component; both are clinically meaningful (22). The primary ef cacy end point for the open-label extension phase was SRI SLEDAI-2K response rate at open- label extension week 24. If the open-label extension week 24 data were missing, data from the open-label extension week 28/exit visit were used. This time point is referred to as open-label exten- sion week 24 throughout the text. Data related to the primary ef cacy end point, e.g., the response rate over time, percentage of patients with a durable SRI SLEDAI-2K response from week 44 through week 52, time to rst SRI SLEDAI-2K response that was maintained through week 52, and duration of longest SRI SLEDAI-2K response among patients with 1 SRI SLEDAI-2K responses were summarized. The key secondary end points were SRI SELENA SLEDAI at week 52 (open-label extension week 24), time to rst severe SLE are (measured by the SELENA SLEDAI are index [SFI]), and proportion of patients whose average prednisone dose had been reduced by 25% from baseline to 7.5 mg/day during week 40 through week 52 (open-label extension week 28/exit visit), in patients receiving >7.5 mg/day at baseline. Key renal end points included time to rst renal are over 52 weeks and over 28 weeks in the open-label extension, SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K renal domain improvement at week 52, SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K renal domain worsening at week 52, percentage reduction in pro- teinuria by visit and at week 52 and open-label extension week 24 and week 28/exit visit among those with baseline proteinuria >0.5 gm/24 hours, and proteinuria shift at week 52 and open-label extension week 24 and week 28/exit visit among those with base- line proteinuria >0.5 gm/24 hours. Renal are is de ned in the Sup- plementary Material (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art. 41900/abstract). Biomarkers measured included percentage changes in serum IgG level, anti-dsDNA antibody level (in those who were anti-dsDNA positive [ 30 IU/ml] at baseline), and complement (C3 and C4) levels from baseline. Safety was evaluated by moni- toring adverse events (AEs), serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special interest, vital signs, clinical laboratory test results, and immunoge- nicity up to 8 weeks posttreatment and throughout the open-label extension phase. Data analyses. For the double-blind phase, safety analy- ses were performed on the safety population, de ned as all patients who were randomized and treated with at least 1 dose of investigational product. Data on the safety population were summarized according to the treatment the patient was random- ized to receive rather than by the treatment that was received, but both were the same for this study. Ef cacy analyses were per- formed on the modi ed intent-to-treat (ITT) population, de ned as the safety population minus those patients who had any assessment at any of 3 study sites that were excluded from the ef cacy analyses before the database lock because of potential Good Clinical Practice noncompliance. For analysis of the primary and 3 key secondary ef cacy end points, a step-down sequential testing procedure was used as described in the Supplementary Material. The following subgroup analyses were performed for the primary analysis (SRI SLEDAI- 2K response at week 52): region (US/Canada versus rest of GINZLER ET AL 114 23265205, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900, Wiley Online Library on [22/02/2023]. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License world), baseline SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K score ( 9 versus 10), baseline anti-dsDNA antibody level ( 30 IU/ml versus <30 IU/ml), baseline complement levels ( 1 test nding showing low C3/C4 [less than the lower limit of normal] versus C3/C4 other [the lower limit of normal or above]), and baseline complement and anti-dsDNA antibody levels ( 1 test nding showing low C3/C4 and anti-dsDNA 30 IU/ml versus C3/C4 other and anti- dsDNA 30 IU/ml). The odds of an SRI SLEDAI-2K response with belimumab treatment versus placebo were estimated using logistic regression analysis. For the open-label extension phase, all patients received beli- mumab, no formal statistical hypothesis testing was completed, and all analyses using descriptive statistics were exploratory in nature. Safety analyses were performed on the ITT population, de ned as all randomized patients who received 1 dose of treat- ment (i.e., at double-blind week 52/open-label extension day 1 or a later open-label extension visit). Ef cacy analyses were performed on the open-label extension modi ed ITT population, excluding the same patients as described above for the modi ed ITT population in the double-blind phase.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License extension phase (Figure 2). The most frequent reasons for with- drawal in the double-blind safety population were AEs (5.8%), patient decision (4.8%), and lack of ef cacy (4.8%). In the open- label extension modi ed ITT population, study closure/ termination due to noncompliance at the aforementioned 3 study sites was the main reason for withdrawal (2.8%), followed by patient decision (1.9%), physician decision, and lost to follow-up (both 1.4%). Patient demographics and baseline characteristics of the modi ed ITT population were generally similar between treatment groups and were representative of this type of study design (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 1, available on the Arthritis & Rheumatology website at http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10. 1002/art.41900/abstract). In the double-blind phase, patients had a mean  SD age of 38.8  11.4 years, 7 patients (1.6%) were age 65 years, and 96.9% were women.

There were unexpected imbalances in baseline SELENA SLEDAI scores and SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K scores, with a larger proportion of patients in the belimumab group having SELENA SLEDAI scores 9 (belimumab 48.8%, placebo 39.6%) and SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K scores 9 (belimumab 47.2%, placebo 37.6%). Ef cacy results. The SRI SLEDAI-2K response rate at week 52, the primary ef cacy end point of the double-blind phase, was numerically but not statistically greater in the belimumab group (48.7%) compared with the placebo group (41.6%) (odds ratio 1.40 [95% con dence interval 0.93, 2.11], P = 0.1068). Over time, the SRI SLEDAI-2K (or SRI SELENA SLEDAI) response rates were consistently greater in the belimumab group compared with the placebo group, starting at week 28 (Supplementary Figures 1A and B, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art. 41900/abstract). The SRI SLEDAI-2K response rate at open- label extension week 24, the primary ef cacy end point of the open-label extension phase, was 73.6% and 18.8% in the contin- uous belimumab group and the placebo-to-belimumab group, respectively, since the start of belimumab treatment (i.e., over 76 weeks in the continuous belimumab group and 24 weeks in the placebo-to-belimumab group). Components of the primary end point of the double-blind and open-label extension phases are shown in Figure 3. A durable SRI SLEDAI-2K response from week 44 through week 52 was achieved by 126 patients (42.3%) in the belimumab group and 48 patients (32.2%) in the placebo group (odds ratio 1.66 [95% con dence interval 1.08, 2.56], P = 0.0209). The 25th percentile of the time to SRI SLEDAI-2K response maintained until week 52 was 116 days (16.6 weeks) in the belimumab group and 204 days (29.1 weeks) in the placebo group (hazard ratio 1.41 [95% con dence interval 1.04, 1.90], P = 0.0256) (Supplementary Figure 2, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/ abstract). The mean  SD duration of longest SRI SLEDAI-2K response among patients with 1 response was longer in the beli- mumab group (172.9  115.65 days [24.7 weeks]) compared with the placebo group (139.1  110.08 days [19.9 weeks]), resulting in an adjusted treatment difference of 40.10 days (95% con dence interval 14.74, 65.46, P = 0.0020). Since the primary end point did not meet statistical signi - cance, key secondary end points in the prespeci ed sequence (SRI SELENA SLEDAI response, time to rst severe SFI are, and prednisone use) could not be declared as statistically signi - cant. The percentage of SRI SELENA SLEDAI responders is presented in the Supplementary Material and in Supplementary Table 1.

The SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K change from base- line over time is shown in Supplementary Figure 3 (http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/abstract). Over the 52-week double-blind phase, patients in the beli- mumab group had a 23% lower risk of experiencing a severe SFI are than those in the placebo group (hazard ratio 0.77 [95% con dence interval 0.51, 1.17], P = 0.2264). Among patients experiencing a severe SFI are (58 of 299 [19.4%] in the belimu- mab group; 37 of 149 [24.8%] in the placebo group), the median time to rst severe SFI are was similar between the belimumab and placebo groups (study day 176 in the belimumab group versus study day 175 in the placebo group). During the open- label extension phase, 4.0% of patients (9 of 225) and 5.5% of patients (6 of 109) in the continuous belimumab and placebo-to- belimumab groups, respectively, experienced a severe SFI are. There was no forced steroid tapering in this study. At base- line, 279 patients (modi ed ITT population; 184 in the belimumab group and 95 in the placebo group) received prednisone at >7.5 mg/day. Of these patients, 27 (14.7%) in the belimumab group and 12 (12.6%) in the placebo group achieved a reduction in prednisone dose by 25% from baseline to 7.5 mg/day during week 40 to week 52 of the double-blind phase (odds ratio 1.30 [95% con dence interval 0.61, 2.80], P = 0.4996).

Odds ratios (ORs) with 95% con dence intervals (95% CIs) and P values were derived using a logistic regression model to compare belimumab with placebo, with covariates of treatment group, baseline Safety of Estrogens in Lupus Ery- thematosus National Assessment SLEDAI (SELENA SLEDAI) SLEDAI-2K (SS-S2K) score ( 9 versus 10), baseline complement levels ( 1 test nding showing low C3/C4 [less than the lower limit of normal] versus C3/C4 other [the lower limit of normal or above]), and region (US/Canada versus rest of world). The open-label extension phase used observed data, and the double-blind phase used nonresponder imputation for withdrawals or treatment failures. The OR was not calculated for the open-label extension phase, as no formal hypothesis testing was performed. * Open-label extension baseline (pre-belimumab) was used for the SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K analysis, with modi ed SLEDAI scoring for proteinuria, of the open-label extension phase.

Subgroup analyses revealed that belimumab-treated patients had greater SRI SLEDAI-2K response rates compared with patients who received placebo if they had the following at baseline: 1) SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K scores 10 (52.5% versus 40.9%), 2) positive anti-dsDNA antibody levels (46.4% ver- sus 36.4%), 3) low complement levels (47.2% versus 24.6%), or 4) low complement levels and positive anti-dsDNA (45.1% versus 24.0%) (Figure 4). Patients in the US/Canada had similar SRI SLEDAI-2K response rates with belimumab as with placebo (37.4% versus 38.5%), whereas those in the rest of the world had a higher response rate with belimumab compared with pla- cebo (57.5% versus 44.0%). Patients in the double-blind phase who received belimumab had a 46% lower risk of experiencing a renal are compared with those who received placebo (hazard ratio 0.54 [95% con dence interval 0.21, 1.36], P = 0.1880). Among patients who experi- enced a renal are (9 of 299 [3.0%] in the belimumab group; 9 of 149 [6.0%] in the placebo group), the median study day of the renal are was day 196 (range 57 309) in the belimumab group and day 153 (range 30 337) in the placebo group. In the open-label extension phase, 3.1% of patients (7 of 225) in the continuous belimumab group and 4.6% of patients (5 of 109) in the placebo-to-belimumab group experienced renal ares over 28 weeks. Among these patients, the median study day of the renal are was day 169 (range 162 193) in the contin- uous belimumab group and day 169 (range 85 197) in the placebo-to-belimumab group. In the double-blind phase, among patients with baseline SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K renal involvement, more patients in the belimumab group (41.8% [23 of 55]) experienced improve- ment in this domain compared with those in the placebo group (20.6% [7 of 34]). Among those without baseline SELENA SLE- DAI SLEDAI-2K renal involvement, the percentage of patients who experienced worsening in this domain was low in both groups (6.1% [15 of 244] in the belimumab group; 7.8% [9 of 115] in the placebo group). Changes in proteinuria by visit in patients in the double-blind phase with baseline proteinuria >0.5 gm/24 hours are shown in Supplementary Figure 4 (http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/abstract).

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License placebo to belimumab at the start of the open-label extension phase. At week 52 of the double-blind phase, 16 patients (42.1%) in the belimumab group and 6 (26.1%) in the placebo group with baseline proteinuria >0.5 gm/24 hours experienced a downward shift in proteinuria to 0.5 gm/24 hours. At open-label extension week 24, 20 patients (58.8%) in the continuous belimu- mab group and 6 (35.3%) in the placebo-to-belimumab group experienced a downward shift in proteinuria to 0.5 gm/24 hours since the start of the double-blind phase and the start of the open-label extension phase, respectively. Biomarker results are shown in Supplementary Table 2 (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/abstract). With belimumab versus placebo treatment in the double-blind phase, there was a greater reduction in the percentage change in IgG levels from baseline (P < 0.0001) and percentage change in anti-dsDNA levels from baseline (P = 0.0004 among patients who were anti-dsDNA positive at baseline). Greater increases in C3 and C4 levels were observed in those who received beli- mumab versus those who received placebo (P = 0.0087 and P < 0.0001, respectively). Safety. In the double-blind phase, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 AE was similar between treatment groups (83.7% in the belimumab group; 87.3% in the placebo group). In the open-label extension phase, the proportion of patients who experienced at least 1 AE was 62.8% and 66.7% in the continuous belimumab and placebo-to-belimumab groups, respectively (Table 2 and Supplementary Table 3, http:// onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/abstract). The AEs most commonly reported in either treatment group during the double-blind phase were upper respiratory tract infec- tion (14.8% in the belimumab group; 8.5% in the placebo group) and urinary tract infection (13.0% in the belimumab; 12.7% in the placebo group). In the open-label extension phase, in which all patients received belimumab, the AEs most commonly reported (occurring in 5% of patients) were upper respiratory tract infection (6.7%), in uenza (6.4%), and urinary tract infection (5.6%). AEs in the double-blind phase occurring more commonly in belimumab- treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients (and occurring in 5% of patients) and with a between-group difference in incidence of 1% were upper respiratory tract infection, diarrhea, sinusitis, vomiting, cough, and hypertension. In the double-blind phase, the incidence of SAEs was lower in the belimumab group (10.9%) compared with the placebo group (18.8%), and the SAE with the highest incidence was infec- tions and infestations (3.3% in the belimumab group; 7.9% in the placebo group). There was a similar incidence of infections and infestations between the belimumab group and placebo group (59.2% and 60.0%, respectively) and a similar incidence of seri- ous infections and serious infestations between the belimumab group and placebo group (3.3% and 7.9%, respectively). The rate of opportunistic infection AEs of special interest, including active tuberculosis and herpes zoster, was 0.6% in the belimu- mab group and 1.2% in the placebo group. Overall, during the open-label extension phase, 5.3% of patients experienced at least 1 SAE. In total, 6.6% of patients in the belimumab group and 7.3% in the placebo group discontinued treatment due to an AE in the double-blind phase. In the belimumab group, treatment was dis- continued most commonly because of lupus nephritis (0.9%). Two patients in the belimumab group (0.6%) died, and none died in the placebo group. Both deaths were considered not to be related to belimumab by the study investigator. The death in 1 patient was attributable to nosocomial meningitis, secondary to an SAE of severe cerebrovascular accident (76 days after administration of the rst dose of belimumab, where there was a possibility that the cerebrovascular accident was due to beli- mumab). The patient had a history of hypertension and infection. The second patient, who received 1 dose of belimumab and developed multidrug-resistant pneumonia 8 days later, died on day 46. There were no deaths in the open-label extension phase, and 1 patient in the placebo-to-belimumab group experi- enced an AE that resulted in treatment discontinuation (Table 2).

DISCUSSION To our knowledge, this is the rst randomized, placebo- controlled clinical trial in SLE focusing on patients of self-identi ed Black race. The response to treatment with belimumab 10 mg/kg IV plus standard therapy did not achieve statistical superiority over placebo plus standard therapy when assessed on the basis of the double-blind phase primary end point; however, SRI SLEDAI-2K response rates were numerically higher in those who received beli- mumab. Although the magnitude of the treatment group difference favoring belimumab is lower in this study (response rate 49% with belimumab versus 42% with placebo, odds ratio 1.40 [95% con - dence interval 0.93, 2.11]) when compared with that observed in the 2 pivotal phase III studies of IV belimumab (response rate in the Study of Belimumab in Subjects with SLE 52-week trial [BLISS-52], 58% with belimumab versus 44% with placebo, odds ratio 1.83 [95% con dence interval 1.30, 2.59]; response rate in the BLISS 76-week trial [BLISS-76], 43% with belimumab versus 34% with placebo, odds ratio 1.52 [95% con dence interval 1.07, 2.15]), the ef cacy results are directionally consistent (13,14,24). Our results support the post hoc analysis of the previous phase II study, which showed an improved SELENA SLEDAI response with belimumab compared with placebo in patients of Black African ancestry (17) and contradicted the post hoc analyses of the pivotal phase III studies (18,25). The large difference in SRI SLEDAI-2K response in the open- label extension phase between the 2 treatment groups may be due to the difference in the length of time that patients received belimu- mab (>76 weeks in the continuous belimumab group versus 24 weeks in the placebo-to-belimumab group). At open-label extension baseline (start of belimumab treatment), the placebo-to- belimumab group also had lower disease activity compared with the continuous belimumab group, which may have made it more dif cult to meet the SLEDAI component of the SRI end point. The durable SRI SLEDAI-2K response showed a greater dif- ference between treatment groups relative to that in the primary analysis. The time to rst SRI SLEDAI-2K response that was maintained through week 52 occurred earlier in the belimumab group compared with the placebo group, and the belimumab group had a longer duration of SRI SLEDAI-2K response com- pared with the placebo group. The population recruited in this study had a generally lower disease activity than the overall population in the pivotal phase III studies (13,14,16), which may have contributed to the reduced effect size observed. However, subgroup analyses showed higher SRI SLEDAI-2K responses in the belimumab group com- pared with the placebo group among patients with high disease activity at baseline (i.e., SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K score 10, low complement levels, and low complement levels plus positive anti-dsDNA). This nding is consistent with subgroup analyses of the pivotal phase III trials, in which patients with high disease activity had a greater SRI SELENA SLEDAI effect size with beli- mumab compared with standard therapy (Supplementary Figure 5, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/ abstract) (26). These ndings add to the growing body of evi- dence supporting the bene t of belimumab in patients with high disease activity, regardless of race. High disease activity is more common in those of non-White descent, including African descendants (10), and this classi cation may be useful to practic- ing clinicians to more easily identify patients who might have an enhanced response to belimumab. Regional analyses of the primary end point showed that patients in the rest-of-world subgroup compared with the US/Canada subgroup had a higher response to belimumab than to placebo, while those in the US/Canada subgroup had a similar response between treatment groups. A lower proportion of patients in the US/Canada subgroup had low complement levels at baseline than those in the rest-of-world subgroup. Due to this imbalance of baseline disease activity by region, post hoc analyses for response by region and baseline complement level were per- formed. In patients with low complement levels in both regions, a bene t was observed with belimumab compared with placebo. These regional baseline differences may have contributed to the higher response difference favoring belimumab in the rest-of-world subgroup compared with the US/Canada subgroup. Renal involvement is more common and severe in patients of Black African ancestry (10,27 29). Although this study was not powered to determine a treatment difference in renal end points, patients treated with belimumab had an improved SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K renal domain score, decrease in proteinuria, and a downward shift in proteinuria among those with high proteinuria at baseline. In this study, the observation that patients with renal manifestations may bene t from treatment with belimumab is supported by the post hoc analysis performed by Dooley et al and was con rmed in the BLISS in Lupus Nephritis study (ClinicalTrials.gov identi er: NCT01639339), which also included patients of Black African ancestry (30,31). Immunoglobulin and SLE biomarker responses from this study were consistent with those in the pivotal belimumab studies (13,14). The incidences of AEs, and the AE and SAE pro le in this study, were consistent with those in the overall SLE population of the BLISS-52, BLISS-76, and BLISS-SC trials (13,14,16). Although patients in the open-label extension continuous belimu- mab group received more exposure to belimumab than those in the placebo-to-belimumab group, no clinically meaningful safety differences were observed. This study has several limitations. The introduction of the SRI SLEDAI-2K as a treatment response end point was expected to increase the sensitivity of the study to identify a between-group treatment difference as compared with that assessed using the SRI SELENA SLEDAI, and consequently, the sample size was BELIMUMAB IN PATIENTS OF BLACK AFRICAN ANCESTRY 121 23265205, 2022, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900, Wiley Online Library on [22/02/2023].

Unfortu- nately, the predicted increase in sensitivity was not realized and this, combined with the loss of 48 participants from the modi ed ITT population due to site noncompliance, resulted in reduced power. Despite strati cation at screening, a higher proportion of patients in the belimumab group had a SELENA SLEDAI SLE- DAI-2K score of 9 at baseline, and the mean baseline SELENA SLEDAI SLEDAI-2K score was slightly lower compared with the placebo group. It is possible that a 4-point reduction in the score may therefore have been harder to achieve in the belimumab group compared with the placebo group due to disease changes after screening. Furthermore, subgroup analyses across studies have consistently demonstrated that patients with baseline SELENA SLEDAI scores of 10 bene t more from treatment with belimumab compared with those with baseline scores of 9 (Supplementary Figure 5, http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/art.41900/ abstract). Therefore, this imbalance may have contributed to the reduction in the overall effect size on the primary end point. This study was initiated as one of the postapproval commit- ments for belimumab. The decision not to include forced steroid tapering, which was made to ensure the study design was compa- rable to that of the pivotal BLISS studies, may have contributed to the inability to differentiate between the 2 groups. Although a reduction in steroid use without mandated tapering has been dem- onstrated following belimumab treatment (32), steroid tapering is an important consideration for the design of future studies in order to ensure that the full treatment effect of a new medicine may be demonstrated. Other than self-identi cation, no de nitions were applied to the inclusion criteria of Black race. This resulted in the inclusion of a proportion of patients who did not identify as being primarily of Black race but considered themselves of mixed race. Although there is variability in the population of patients who self- identi ed as being of Black race, this study is unique in the SLE eld in that it limits the inclusion criteria by race. Overall, belimumab 10 mg/kg IV plus standard therapy was generally well tolerated; no new safety signals were observed, and ndings were consistent with the known safety pro le of belimu- mab. Ef cacy and safety appear to be maintained over time. Although statistical signi cance was not achieved overall, a greater percentage of patients attained the primary end point in the belimu- mab group compared with the placebo group. Importantly, patients with baseline high disease activity or renal disease bene ted from treatment with belimumab, a nding that adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the bene t of belimumab in these groups (13,14,16,30). This study provides clinically mean- ingful evidence to inform clinicians regarding the management of SLE in patients of Black African ancestry, especially those with high disease activity, a patient population with high unmet needs.
