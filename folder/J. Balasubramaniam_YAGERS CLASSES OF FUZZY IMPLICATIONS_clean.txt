Along similar lines, one of us has pro- posed another class of fuzzy implications called the h-generated implications. In this article we discuss in detail some properties of the above mentioned classes of fuzzy implications and we describe their relationships amongst themselves and with the well established (S, N)- implications and R-implications. In the cases where they intersect the precise sub-families have been determined. Keywords: fuzzy implication, f-generated implication, g-generated implication, h- generated implication, (S; N)-implication, S-implication, R-implication AMS Subject Classi cation: 03B52, 03E72, 39B99 1. INTRODUCTION Recently, Yager [12] has introduced two new families of fuzzy implications, called the f-generated and g-generated implications, respectively, and discussed their desirable properties as listed in [4] or [5]. Also, Balasubramaniam [3] has discussed f-generated implications with respect to three classical logic tautologies, viz., the distributivity, the law of importation and the contrapositive symmetry. In [2, 3] a new class of fuzzy implications, along the lines of f-generated implications, called the h-generated implications has been proposed. In this work, we attempt to answer the following questions: Problem 1. (i) What are the properties of f-, g- and h-generated implications? (ii) Do the above families of fuzzy implications intersect with the two well-known classes of fuzzy implications, viz., (S, N)-implications and R-implications? We show that they are, in general, di erent from the well established (S, N)- and R-implications. In the cases where they intersect with the above families of fuzzy implications, we have determined precisely the sub-families of such intersections. 158 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we present some preliminary de - nitions and results connected with (S, N)- and R-implications. In the next three sec- tions we give the de nitions of the newly proposed families of f-, g- and h-generated fuzzy implications and also prove some new results concerning them. While in Sec- tion 6 we investigate the intersections amongst the families of f-, g- and h-generated fuzzy implications, Sections 7 and 8 contain our investigations on the intersections of the families of f-, g- and h-generated fuzzy implications with (S, N)- and R- implications, respectively. Section 9 gives some concluding remarks. 2. PRELIMINARIES We assume that the reader is familiar with the classical results concerning basic fuzzy logic connectives (fuzzy negations, t-norms, t-conorms, fuzzy implications), but we brie y recall some de nitions, examples and facts that will be useful in the sequel (for more details see [5, 8] or [6]). De nition 1. (Fodor and Roubens [5], Klement et al. [7]) A decreasing function N : [0, 1] [0, 1] is called a fuzzy negation if N(0) = 1 and N(1) = 0. A fuzzy negation N is called (i) strict if, in addition, it is strictly decreasing and continuous. (ii) strong if, in addition, it is an involution, i. e., N(N(x)) = x for all x [0, 1]. Example 1. Table 1 lists a few negations with the properties they satisfy. For more examples see [5] or [8]. Table 1. Examples of fuzzy negations and their properties. Name Formula Properties classical NC(x) = 1 x strong G odel NG1(x) = ( 1, if x = 0 0, if x > 0 not continuous, smallest dual G odel NG2(x) = ( 1, if x < 1 0, if x = 1 not continuous, greatest In the literature, especially at the beginnings, we can nd several di erent def- initions of fuzzy implications (see [4, 5]). In this article we will use the following one, which is equivalent to the de nition introduced by Fodor and Roubens (cf. [5], De nition 1.15). Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 159 De nition 2. A function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a fuzzy implication if it satis es the following conditions: I is decreasing in the rst variable, (I1) I is increasing in the second variable, (I2) I(0, 0) = 1, I(1, 1) = 1, I(1, 0) = 0. (I3) De nition 3. (cf. Dubois and Prade [4], Fodor and Roubens [5], Gottwald [6]) A fuzzy implication I is said to satisfy (i) the left neutrality property or is said to be left neutral, if I(1, y) = y, y [0, 1]; (NP) (ii) the exchange principle, if I(x, I(y, z)) = I(y, I(x, z)), x, y, z [0, 1]; (EP) (iii) the identity principle, if I(x, x) = 1, x [0, 1]; (IP) (iv) the ordering property, if x y I(x, y) = 1, x, y [0, 1]; (OP) (v) the contrapositive symmetry with respect to a fuzzy negation N, CP(N), if I(x, y) = I(N(y), N(x)), x, y [0, 1]. (CP) De nition 4. Let I be a fuzzy implication. The function NI de ned by NI(x) = I(x, 0) for all x [0, 1], is called the natural negation of I. It can be easily shown that NI is a fuzzy negation for every fuzzy implication I. De nition 5. (Fodor and Roubens [5], Gottwald [6] or Baczy nski and Jayaram [1]) A function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called an (S, N)-implication if there exist a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N such that I(x, y) = S(N(x), y), x, y [0, 1]. If N is a strong negation, then I is called a strong implication (or S-implication). The family of all (S, N)-implications will be denoted by IS,N. The following characterization of (S, N)-implications is from [1], which is an ex- tension of a result in [10] (see also [5], Theorem 1.13). Theorem 1. (Baczy nski and Jayaram [1], Theorem 5.1) For a function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is an (S, N)-implication generated from some t-conorm S and some contin- uous (strict, strong) fuzzy negation N. (ii) I satis es (I2), (EP) and NI is a continuous (strict, strong) fuzzy negation. 160 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM De nition 6. (Dubois and Prade [4], Fodor and Roubens [5], Gottwald [6]) A function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] is called a residual implication (shortly R-implication) if there exists a left-continuous t-norm T such that I(x, y) = max {t [0, 1] | T(x, t) y} , x, y [0, 1]. (1) The family of all R-implications will be denoted by IT . In general, R-implications can be considered for all t-norms (with supremum in (1)), but this class of implications is related to a residuation concept from the intuitionistic logic and in this context this de nition is proper only for left-continuous t-norms (see [6], Proposition 5.4.2 and Corollary. 5.4.1). Theorem 2. (Fodor and Roubens [5], Theorem 1.14) For a function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] the following statements are equivalent: (i) I is an R-implication based on some left-continuous t-norm T. (ii) I satis es (I2), (OP), (EP) and I(x, ) is right-continuous for any x [0, 1]. Example 2. The basic (S, N)- and R-implications can be found in the literature (see [5, 8] or [6]). Here we present only some examples of (S, N)- and R-implications, which will be used in the next part of this article. (i) If S is any t-conorm and N is the G odel negation NG1, then we always obtain the smallest (S, N)-implication IG1(x, y) = ( 1, if x = 0, y, if x > 0, x, y [0, 1]. (ii) If S is any t-conorm and N is the dual G odel negation NG2, then we always obtain the greatest (S, N)-implication IG2(x, y) = ( 1, if x < 1, y, if x = 1, x, y [0, 1]. (iii) If S is the algebraic sum t-conorm SP(x, y) = x+y xy and N is the classical negation NC, then we obtain the following S-implication called the Reichen- bach implication IRC(x, y) = 1 x + xy, x, y [0, 1]. (iv) The R-implication generated from the product t-norm TP(x, y) = xy is the following Goguen implication IGG(x, y) = min 1, y x = ( 1, if x y, y x, if x > y, x, y [0, 1]. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 161 3. THE FAMILY OF f GENERATED IMPLICATIONS In this section, after giving the de nition of this new family of fuzzy implications, we discuss some of their properties. Speci cally, we show that the generator from which f-generated implication is obtained, is only unique up to a positive multiplicative constant. We also investigate the natural negations of the above implications. Proposition 1. (cf. Yager [12], page 197) If f : [0, 1] [0, ] is a strictly de- creasing and continuous function with f(1) = 0, then the function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] de ned by I(x, y) = f 1(x f(y)), x, y [0, 1], (2) with the understanding 0 = 0, is a fuzzy implication. P r o o f . Firstly, since for every x, y [0, 1] we have x f(y) f(y) f(0) we see that the formula (2) is correctly de ned. That I de ned by (2) is a fuzzy implication can be easily shown as in [12], page 197. De nition 7. (Yager [12]) An f-generator f : [0, 1] [0, ] of a fuzzy implication I is a strictly decreasing and continuous function with f(1) = 0, such that for all x, y [0, 1] the function I can be represented by (2). In addition, we say that I is an f-generated implication and if I is generated from f, then we will often write If instead of I. Example 3. (i) If we take the f-generator f(x) = log x, which is a continuous additive generator of the product t-norm TP, then we obtain the Yager implication IYG(x, y) = ( 1, if x = 0 and y = 0, yx, otherwise, x, y [0, 1], which is neither an (S, N)-implication nor an R-implication (see [1]). (ii) If we take the f-generator f(x) = 1 x, which is a continuous additive gener- ator of the Lukasiewicz t-norm TL(x, y) = max(x + y 1, 0), then we obtain the Reichenbach implication IRC, which is an S-implication. For more examples of f-generated implications see Yager [12]. As can be seen from [7] Theorem 5.1 and as noted in [12] and above, the f-gene- rators can be used as continuous additive generators of continuous Archimedean t-norms. Such generators are unique up to a positive multiplicative constant, and this is also true for the f-generators of the f-generated implications. 162 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM Theorem 3. The f-generator of an f-generated implication is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant, i. e., if f1 is an f-generator, then f2 is an f-generator such that If1 = If2 if and only if there exists a constant c (0, ) such that f2(x) = c f1(x) for all x [0, 1]. P r o o f . (= ) Let f1, f2 be two f-generators of an f-generated implication, i. e., If1(x, y) = If2(x, y) for all x, y [0, 1]. Using (2) we get f 1 1 (x f1(y)) = f 1 2 (x f2(y)), x, y [0, 1]. If f1(0) = , then If1(x, 0) = f 1 1 (x f1(0)) = f 1 1 (x ) = f 1 1 ( ) = 0, x (0, 1]. Hence, for all x (0, 1], we have 0 = If1(x, 0) = If2(x, 0) = f 1 2 (x f2(0)), so f2(0) = x f2(0). This implies that f2(0) = or f2(0) = 0. But f2(0) = 0 is impossible, since f2 is a strictly decreasing function. By changing the role of f1 and f2 we obtain the following equivalence: f1(0) = f2(0) = . Now, we consider the following two cases: 1. If f1(0) < , then f2(0) < and we obtain, for every x, y [0, 1], f 1 1 (x f1(y)) = f 1 2 (x f2(y)) f2 f 1 1 (x f1(y)) = x f2(y). In particular, for y = 0 and any x [0, 1], we get f2 f 1 1 (x f1(0)) = x f2(0) f2 f 1 1 (x f1(0)) = x f1(0) f2(0) f1(0). (3) Let us x arbitrarily x [0, 1] and consider z = f1(x). Of course z [0, f1(0)]. Hence there exists x1 [0, 1] such that z = x1 f1(0). From (3) we obtain f2 f 1 1 (z) = f2 f 1 1 (x1 f1(0)) = x1 f1(0) f2(0) f1(0) = z f2(0) f1(0). Since f1 is a bijection, substituting c = f2(0) f1(0) (0, ) we get f2(x) = f1(x) f2(0) f1(0) = c f1(x). But x was arbitrarily xed, so we obtain the claim in this case. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 163 2. If f1(0) = , then f2(0) = . First see that f2(0) = c f1(0) and f2(1) = c f1(1) for every c (0, ). Now, for every x, y [0, 1] we have f 1 1 (x f1(y)) = f 1 2 (x f2(y)) f2 f 1 1 (x f1(y)) = x f2 f 1 1 (f1(y)). By the substitution h = f2 f 1 1 and z = f1(y) for y [0, 1], we obtain the following equation h(x z) = x h(z), x [0, 1], z [0, ], (4) where h: [0, ] [0, ] is a continuous strictly increasing bijection. Let us substitute z = 1 above, we get h(x) = x h(1), x [0, 1]. (5) Now, x arbitrarily x (0, 1) and consider z = f1(x). Of course z (0, ). Hence there exists x1 (0, 1] such that x1 z (0, 1). From (4) and (5) we get h(z) = h(x1 z) x1 = x1 z h(1) x1 = z h(1). Thus, by the de nition of h, we have f2 f 1 1 (z) = z f2 f 1 1 (1). Since f1 is a bijection, substituting c = f2 f 1 1 (1) (0, ) we get f2(x) = f1(x) f2 f 1 1 (1) = c f1(x). But x (0, 1) was arbitrarily xed, so we have the proof in this direction. ( =) Let f1 be an f-generator and c (0, ). De ne f2(x) = c f1(x) for all x [0, 1]. Firstly, we note that f2 is a well de ned f-generator. Moreover, f 1 2 (z) = f 1 1 z c for every z [0, f2(0)]. Now, for every x, y [0, 1], we have x c f1(y) c f1(y) = f2(y) f2(0), x c f1(y) c = x f1(y) f1(y) f1(0) and thus If2(x, y) = f 1 2 (x f2(y)) = f 1 2 (x c f1(y)) = f 1 1 x c f1(y) c = f 1 1 (x f1(y)) = If1(x, y), for all x, y [0, 1]. 164 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM Remark 1. From the above result it follows, that if f is an f-generator such that f(0) < , then the function f1 : [0, 1] [0, 1] de ned by f1(x) = f(x) f(0) , x [0, 1] (6) is a well de ned f-generator such that If = If1 and f1(0) = 1. In other words, it is enough to consider only decreasing generators for which f(0) = or f(0) = 1. Now we investigate the natural negations of If. Proposition 2. Let f be an f-generator of an f-generated implication If. (i) If f(0) = , then the natural negation NIf is the G odel negation NG1, which is non-continuous. (ii) The natural negation NIf is a strict negation if and only if f(0) < . (iii) The natural negation NIf is a strong negation if and only if f(0) < and f1 de ned by (6) is a strong negation. P r o o f . Let f be an f-generator. We get NIf (x) = If(x, 0) = f 1(x f(0)), x [0, 1]. (i) If f(0) = , then for every x [0, 1] we have NIf (x) = f 1(x ) = ( f 1(0), if x = 0 f 1( ), if x > 0 = ( 1, if x = 0 0, if x > 0 = NG1(x). (ii) If f(0) < , then NIf is a composition of real continuous functions, so it is continuous. Moreover, if x1 < x2, then x1 f(0) < x2 f(0) and by the strictness of f 1 we get that NIf is a strict negation. The converse implication is a consequence of the point (i) of this proposition. (iii) If f(0) < , then because of Remark 1 the function f1 de ned by (6) is a well de ned f-generator such that If = If1 and f1(0) = 1. In particular NIf (x) = NIf1 (x) = f 1 1 (x), x [0, 1]. If NIf is a strong negation, then also f 1 1 is a strong negation, so f1 = f 1 1 . Conversely, if f1 is a strong negation, then f 1 1 = f1, so NIf is also a strong negation. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 165 Theorem 4. (cf. Yager [12], p. 197) If f is an f-generator of an f-generated implication If, then (i) If satis es (NP) and (EP); (ii) If(x, x) = 1 if and only if x = 0 or x = 1, i. e., If does not satisfy (IP); (iii) If(x, y) = 1 if and only if x = 0 or y = 1, i. e., If does not satisfy (OP); (iv) If satis es (CP) with some fuzzy negation N if and only if f(0) < , f1 de ned by (6) is a strong negation and N = NIf . (v) If is continuous if and only if f(0) < ; (vi) If is continuous except at the point (0, 0) if and only if f(0) = . P r o o f . (i) That If satis es (NP) and (EP) was shown by Yager [12], page 197. (ii) Let If(x, x) = 1 for some x [0, 1]. This implies that f 1(x f(x)) = 1, thus x f(x) = f(1) = 0, hence x = 0 or f(x) = 0, which by the strictness of f means x = 1. The reverse implication is obvious. (iii) Proof is similar to that for (ii). (iv) If satis es (NP) and (EP), so by Corollaries 2.3 and 2.5 from [1] it can satisfy (CP) with some fuzzy negation N if and only if N = NIf is a strong negation. Therefore, if we assume that If satis es CP(NIf ), then the natural negation NIf is strong. Because of Proposition 2 (iii) we obtain the thesis in the rst direction. Conversely, if f(0) < and f1 de ned by (6) is a strong negation, then again from Proposition 2 (iii) the natural negation NIf is strong, hence If satis es CP(NIf ). (v) If f(0) < , then If given by (2) is the composition of the real continuous functions, so it is continuous. On the other hand, if f(0) = , then because of previous proposition, the natural negation is not continuous and therefore If is also non-continuous. (vi) If f(0) = , then If is continuous for every x, y (0, 1]. Further, for every y [0, 1] we get If(0, y) = 1 and for every x (0, 1] we have If(x, 0) = 0, so I is not continuous in the point (0, 0). In addition, for every xed y (0, 1] we have f(y) < and lim x 0+ If(x, y) = lim x 0+ f 1(x f(y)) = f 1(0) = 1 = If(0, y). Finally, for every x (0, 1] we have lim y 0+ If(x, y) = lim y 0+ f 1(x f(y)) = f 1( ) = 0 = If(x, 0). We would like to point out that by Theorem 4 (v) above, the point D-7 in [12], page 197 is untrue. 166 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM 4. THE FAMILY OF g-GENERATED IMPLICATIONS Yager [12] has also proposed another class of implications called the g-generated implications. In a similar way as in the previous section we discuss its properties. Proposition 3. (Yager [12], page 202) If g: [0, 1] [0, ] is a strictly increasing and continuous function with g(0) = 0, then the function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] de ned by I(x, y) = g( 1) 1 x g(y) , x, y [0, 1], (7) with the understanding 1 0 = and 0 = , is a fuzzy implication. The function g( 1) in (7) is called the pseudo-inverse of g and is given by g( 1)(x) = ( g 1(x), if x [0, g(1)], 1, if x [g(1), ]. Therefore, (7) can be written in the following form I(x, y) = g 1 min 1 x g(y), g(1) , x, y [0, 1], (8) without explicitly using the pseudo-inverse. De nition 8. (Yager [12]) A g-generator g: [0, 1] [0, ] of a fuzzy implication I is a strictly increasing and continuous function with g(0) = 0, such that for all x, y [0, 1] the function I can be represented by (7) (or, equivalently, by (8)). In addition, we say that I is a g-generated implication and if I is generated from g, then we will often write Ig instead of I. Example 4. (i) If we take the g-generator g(x) = log(1 x), which is a continuous additive generator of the algebraic sum t-conorm SP, then we obtain the following fuzzy implication I(x, y) = ( 1, if x = 0 and y = 0, 1 (1 y) 1 x , otherwise, x, y [0, 1]. which is neither an (S, N)-implication nor an R-implication. (ii) If we take the g-generator g(x) = x, which is a continuous additive generator of the Lukasiewicz t-conorm SL(x, y) = min(x+y, 1), then we obtain the Goguen implication IGG, which is an R-implication. For more examples of g-generated implications see Yager [12]. The g-generators can be used as continuous additive generators of continuous Archimedean t-conorms. Such a generator is unique up to a positive multiplicative constant, and this is also true for the g-generators of the g-generated implications. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 167 Theorem 5. The g-generator of a g-generated implication is uniquely determined up to a positive multiplicative constant, i. e., if g1 is a g-generator, then g2 is a g-generator such that Ig1 = Ig2 if and only if there exists a constant c (0, ) such that g2(x) = c g1(x) for all x [0, 1]. P r o o f . (= ) Let g1, g2 be two g-generators of a g-generated implication, i. e., assume that Ig1(x, y) = Ig2(x, y) for all x, y [0, 1]. Using (7) we get g( 1) 1 1 x g1(y) = g( 1) 2 1 x g2(y) , x, y [0, 1]. If g1(1) = , then g2(1) = . Indeed, let us assume that g2(1) < and x arbi- trarily y0 (0, 1). Then there exists x0 (0, 1) such that 1 x0 g2(y0) > g2(1), since limx 0+ 1 x g2(y0) = . Hence g( 1) 2 1 x0 g2(y0) = 1, but g( 1) 1 1 x0 g1(y0) = g 1 1 1 x0 g1(y0) < 1, a contradiction to the assumption that Ig1 = Ig2. By changing the role of g1 and g2 we obtain the following equivalence: g1(1) = g2(1) = . Now, we consider the following two cases: 1. If g1(1) = , then also g2(1) = . Firstly, note that g2(0) = c g1(0) and g2(1) = c g1(1) for every c (0, ). Now, for every x, y [0, 1] we have Ig1(x, y) = Ig2(x, y) g 1 1 1 x g1(y) = g 1 2 1 x g2(y) g2 g 1 1 1 x g1(y) = 1 x g2(y) g2 g 1 1 1 x g1(y) = 1 x g2 g 1 1 (g1(y)). By the substitution h = g2 g 1 1 and z = g1(y) for y [0, 1], we obtain the following equation h 1 x z = 1 x h(z), x [0, 1], z [0, ], (9) where h: [0, ] [0, ] is a continuous strictly increasing bijection such that h(0) = 0 and h( ) = . Let us substitute z = 1 above, we get h 1 x = 1 x h(1), x [0, 1]. (10) Fix arbitrarily x (0, 1) and consider z = g1(x). Of course z (0, ). Hence there exists x1 (0, 1) such that x1 1 z (0, 1). From (9) and (10) we get h(z) = x1 h 1 x1 z = x1 h 1 x1 z = x1 1 x1 z h(1) = z h(1). 168 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM Now, by the de nition of h, we have g2 g 1 1 (z) = z g2 g 1 1 (1), thus g2(x) = g1(x) g2 g 1 1 (1). But x (0, 1) was arbitrarily xed, so letting c = g2 g 1 1 (1) we obtain the result in this case. 2. In the case g1(1) < we also have g2(1) < . Now, for every x, y [0, 1] we have Ig1(x, y) = Ig2(x, y) g 1 1 min 1 x g1(y), g1(1) = g 1 2 min 1 x g2(y), g2 (1) g2 g 1 1 min 1 x g1(y), g1(1) = min 1 x g2(y), g2(1) . By the substitution h = g2 g 1 1 , u = 1 x and v = g1(y) for x, y [0, 1], we obtain the following equation h (min (u v, g1(1))) = min (u h(v), g2(1)) , u [1, ], v [0, g1(1)], where the function h: [0, g1(1)] [0, g2(1)] is a continuous and strictly in- creasing function such that h (0) = 0 and h (g1(1)) = g2(1). Let us x any x (0, 1). Then x v < g1(1) for all v (0, g1(1)). Since h is strictly increas- ing h (x v) < g2(1) and h(v) < g2(1) for all v (0, g1(1)). Therefore h (v) = h 1 x x v = h min 1 x x v, g1(1) = min 1 x h (x v) , g2(1) = 1 x h(x v), for every v (0, g1(1)). Hence, from the continuity of h, we have g2(1) = h (g1(1)) = lim v g1(1) h(v) = lim v g1(1) 1 x h (x v) = 1 x h x lim v g1(1) v = 1 x h (x g1(1)) . Since x (0, 1) was arbitrarily xed, we get h (x g1(1)) = x g2(1), x (0, 1). (11) Now, for any xed v (0, g1(1)) there exists x1 (0, 1) such that v = x1 g1(1) and the previous equality implies h(v) = h (x1 g1(1)) = x1 g2(1) = x1 g1(1) g2(1) g1(1) = v g2(1) g1(1), Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 169 for all v (0, g1(1)). Note that this formula is also correct for v = 0 and v = g1(1). Therefore, by the de nition of h we get g2 g 1 1 (v) = v g2(1) g1(1), v [0, g1(1)], thus g2(y) = g1(y) g2(1) g1(1), y [0, 1]. Putting c = g2(1) g1(1) we obtain the result. ( =) Let g1 be a g-generator and c (0, ). De ne g2(x) = c g1(x) for all x [0, 1]. Evidently g2 is a well de ned g-generator. Moreover, for any z [0, ], g( 1) 2 (z) = ( g 1 1 z c , if z [0, c g1(1)], 1, if z [c g1(1), ]. This implies, that for every x, y [0, 1] we get Ig2(x, y) = g 1 2 min 1 x g2(y), g2(1) = g 1 1 1 c min 1 x c g1(y), c g1(1) = g 1 1 min 1 x g1(y), g1(1) = Ig1(x, y). Remark 2. From the above result it follows, that if g is a g-generator such that g(1) < , then the function g1 : [0, 1] [0, 1] de ned by g1(x) = g(x) g(1) , x [0, 1] (12) is a well de ned g-generator such that Ig = Ig1 and g1(1) = 1. In other words, it is enough to consider only decreasing generators for which g(1) = or g(1) = 1. Proposition 4. Let g be a g-generator. The natural negation of Ig is the G odel negation NG1, which is not continuous. P r o o f . Let g be a g-generator For every x [0, 1] we get NIg(x) = Ig(x, 0) = g( 1) 1 x g(0) = g( 1) 1 x 0 = ( g( 1)( ), if x = 0 g( 1)(0), if x > 0 = ( 1, if x = 0 0, if x > 0 = NG1(x). 170 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM Theorem 6. (cf. Yager [12], page 201) If g is a g-generator of a g-generated implication Ig, then (i) Ig satis es (NP) and (EP); (ii) Ig satis es (IP) if and only if g(1) < and x g1(x) for every x [0, 1], where g1 is de ned by (12); (iii) if g(1) = , then Ig(x, y) = 1 if and only if x = 0 or y = 1, i. e., Ig does not satisfy (OP) when g(1) = ; (iv) Ig does not satisfy the contrapositive symmetry (CP) with any fuzzy negation; (v) Ig is continuous except at the point (0, 0). P r o o f . (i) That Ig de ned by (7) satis es (NP) and (EP) was shown by Yager [12], page 201. (ii) Let us assume rstly that g(1) = . This implies that g( 1) = g 1. Let Ig(x, x) = 1 for some x [0, 1]. This implies that g 1 1 x g(x) = 1, thus 1 x g(x) = g(1) = , hence x = 0 or g(x) = , which by the strictness of g means x = 1. Therefore Ig does not satisfy (IP) when g(1) = . Let us assume now, that Ig satis es the identity property (IP). Therefore it should be g(1) < . By Theorem 5 the function g1 de ned by (12) is a well de ned g-generator such that Ig = Ig1 and g1(1) = 1. Now (IP) implies, that for every x (0, 1] we get Ig(x, x) = 1 Ig1(x, x) = 1 g( 1) 1 1 x g1(x) = 1 g 1 1 min 1 x g1(x), g1(1) = 1 1 x g1(x) g1(1) 1 x g1(x) 1 x g1(x). The converse implication is a direct consequence of the above equivalences. (iii) Let us assume that g(1) = . This implies that g( 1) = g 1. Let Ig(x, y) = 1 for some x, y [0, 1]. This implies that g 1( 1 x g(y)) = 1, thus 1 x g(y) = g(1) = , hence x = 0 or g(y) = , which by the strictness of g means y = 1. The reverse implication is obvious. (iv) By the point (i) above the g-generated implication Ig satis es (NP) and (EP), so again it can satisfy the contrapositive symmetry only with NIg which should be a strong negation. But from Proposition 4 we see that the natural negation NIg is not strong. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 171 (v) By the formula (8), the implication Ig is continuous for every x, y (0, 1]. Further, for every y [0, 1] we get Ig(0, y) = 1 and for every x (0, 1] we have Ig(x, 0) = 0, so Ig is not continuous in the point (0, 0). In addition, for every xed y (0, 1] we have g(y) > 0 and consequently lim x 0+ Ig(x, y) = lim x 0+ g 1 min 1 x g(y), g(1) = g 1(g(1)) = 1 = Ig(0, y). Finally, for every x (0, 1] we have 1 x < , thus lim y 0+ If(x, y) = lim y 0+ g 1 min 1 x g(y), g(1) = g 1(0) = 0 = Ig(x, 0). We would like to point out that by Theorem 6 (v) above, the point D-7 in [12], page 202 is untrue. In the last theorem in this section, we will show that Ig satis es the ordering property only for a rather special class of g-generators. Theorem 7. If g is a g-generator, then the following statements are equivalent: (i) Ig satis es (OP). (ii) g(1) < and there exists a constant c (0, ) such that g(x) = c x for all x [0, 1]. (iii) Ig is the Goguen implication IGG. P r o o f . (i) = (ii) Let us assume that Ig satis es the ordering property (OP). From Theorem 6 (iii) we have g(1) < . By Remark 2 the function g1 de ned by (12) is a well de ned g-generator such that Ig = Ig1 and g1(1) = 1. Now (OP) implies, that for every x, y (0, 1] we get x y Ig(x, y) = 1 Ig1(x, y) = 1 g( 1) 1 1 x g1(y) = 1 g 1 1 min 1 x g1(y), g1(1) = 1 1 x g1(y) g1(1) 1 x g1(y) 1 x g1(y). (13) This equivalence can be also written in the following form x > y x > g1(y), x, y (0, 1]. (14) 172 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM We show that g1(x) = x for all x (0, 1]. Suppose that this does not hold, i. e., there exists x0 (0, 1) such that g1(x0) = x0. If x0 < g1(x0), then by the continuity and strict monotonicity of the generator g1 there exists y0 (0, 1) such that x0 < g1(y0) < g1(x0). (15) Because of (13) we get x0 y0. Since g1 is strictly increasing g1(x0) g1(y0), a contradiction to (15). If 0 < g1(x0) < x0, then by the continuity and strict monotonicity of the generator g1 there exists y0 (0, 1) such that g1(x0) < g1(y0) < x0. (16) Because of (14) we get y0 < x0. Since g1 is strictly increasing g1(y0) < g1(x0), a contradiction to (16). We showed, that g1(x) = x for all x (0, 1), but also g1(0) = 0 and g1(1) = 1. By virtue of (12) we get that g(x) = g(1) x. (ii) = (iii) If g(1) < and g(x) = c x for all x [0, 1], with some c (0, ), then g(1) = c and g-generator given by (12) is equal to g1(x) = x. From Example 4 (ii) we conclude, that Ig1 = Ig is the Goguen implication. (ii) = (iii) If Ig is the Goguen implication, then it is a well known result that it satis es the ordering property (OP). 5. THE FAMILY OF h-GENERATED IMPLICATIONS As noted earlier the f- and g-generators can be seen as the continuous additive generators of t-norms and t-conorms, respectively. Taking cue from this, a new family of fuzzy implications called the h-generated implications has been proposed by Balasubramaniam [2], where h can be seen as a multiplicative generator of a continuous Archimedean t-conorm. In this section we give its de nitions and discuss a few of its properties. Proposition 5. (Balasubramaniam [2]) If h: [0, 1] [0, 1] is a strictly decreasing and continuous function with h(0) = 1, then the function I : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] de ned by I(x, y) = h( 1) (x h(y)) , x, y [0, 1], (17) is a fuzzy implication. The function h( 1) : [0, 1] [0, 1] in the above formula is again the pseudo-inverse of h and is given by h( 1)(x) = ( h 1(x), if x [h(1), 1], 1, if x [0, h(1)]. Therefore (17) can be written in the following form I(x, y) = h 1 (max (x h(y), h(1))) , x, y [0, 1], (18) without explicitly using the pseudo-inverse. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 173 De nition 9. (Balasubramaniam [2]) An h-generator h: [0, 1] [0, 1] of a fuzzy implication I is a strictly decreasing and continuous function with h(0) = 1, such that for all x, y [0, 1] the function I can be represented by (17) (or, equivalently, by (18)). In addition, we say that I is an h-generated implication and if I is generated from h, then we will often write Ih instead of I. Example 5. (i) If we take h(x) = 1 x, which is a continuous multiplicative generator of the algebraic sum t-conorm SP, then we obtain the Reichenbach implication IRC, which is an S-implication. (ii) If we consider the family of h-generators hn(x) = 1 xn n , n N, then we obtain the following fuzzy implications In(x, y) = min (n n x + x yn) 1 n , 1 , x, y [0, 1], which are (S, N)-implications. For more examples of h-generated implications see Balasubramaniam [2] or [3]. Firstly we prove the following result. Theorem 8. The h-generator of an h-generated implication is uniquely deter- mined, i. e., h1, h2 are h-generators such that Ih1 = Ih2 if and only if h1 = h2. P r o o f . Let h1, h2 be two h-generators of h-generated implication, i.e., Ih1(x, y) = Ih2(x, y) for all x, y [0, 1]. Using (18) we have, for all x, y [0, 1] Ih1(x, y) = Ih2(x, y) h1 1 (max (x h1(y), h1(1))) = h2 1 (max (x h2(y), h2(1))) h2 h1 1 (max (x h1(y), h1(1))) = max (x h2(y), h2(1)) . (19) Now letting g = h2 h1 1, h2(y) = u and h1(y) = v we get h2(y) = h2 h1 1 h1(y) = g h1(y) = g(v). Also g : [h1(1), 1] [h2(1), 1] is a continuous and strictly increasing function such that g(h1(1)) = h2(1) and g(1) = 1. Substituting the above in (19) we obtain g(max (x v, h1(1))) = max (x g(v), g(h1(1))) , x [0, 1], v [h1(1), 1]. Let us take any x (h1(1), 1] and put v = 1 above. We get g(x) = g(x 1) = g(max (x 1, h1(1))) = max (x g(1), h2(1)) = max (x, h2(1)) . Since the function g is strictly increasing we get g(x) = x for all x (h1(1), 1]. From the continuity this is also true for x = h1(1). Substituting for g we get h2 h1 1(v) = v for all v [h1(1), 1] or that h1(x) = h2(x) for all x [0, 1]. The reverse implication is obvious. 174 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM Proposition 6. Let h be an h-generator of Ih. (i) The natural negation NIh is a continuous fuzzy negation. (ii) The natural negation NIh is a strict negation if and only if h(1) = 0. (iii) The natural negation NIh is strong negation if and only if h = h 1. P r o o f . Since for every x [0, 1] we get NIh(x) = Ih(x, 0) = h( 1)(x h(0)) = h( 1)(x) = h 1 (max (x, h(1))) , it is obvious, that NIh is a continuous fuzzy negation. The other points are the consequence of the de nitions of strict (strong) negations and h-generators. Theorem 9. If h is an h-generator of an h-generated implication Ih, then (i) Ih satis es (NP) and (EP); (ii) Ih satis es (IP) if and only if h(1) > 0 and x h(x) h(1) for every x [0, 1]; (iii) Ih does not satisfy (OP); (iv) Ih satis es (CP) with some fuzzy negation N if and only if h = h 1 and N = NIh; (v) Ih is continuous. P r o o f . (i) For every h-generator h and y [0, 1] we have Ih(1, y) = h( 1) (1 h(y)) = y and for all x, y, z [0, 1] we get Ih(x, Ih(y, z)) = h( 1) (x h(Ih(y, z))) = h 1 max x h(h 1 (max (y h(z), h(1)))), h(1) = h 1 (max (x max (y h(z), h(1)) , h(1))) = h 1 (max (x y h(z), x h(1), h(1))) = h 1 (max (x y h(z), h(1))) , since x h(1) h(1). Similarly we get that Ih(y, Ih(x, z)) = h 1 (max (y x h(z), h(1))) . Thus Ih satis es the neutral property and the exchange principle. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 175 (ii) Firstly, note that if h(1) = 0, then it can be seen as the f-generator, and by virtue of Theorem 4 (ii) it does not satisfy (IP). Let us assume that Ih satis es the identity property (IP). Therefore it should be h(1) > 0. Now, for every x [0, 1] we get Ih(x, x) = 1 h( 1)(x h(x)) = 1 h 1 (max (x h(x), h(1))) = 1 x h(x) h(1). The converse implication is a direct consequence of the above equivalences. (iii) If h(1) = 0, then h can be seen as the f-generator, and because of Theo- rem 4 (iii) it does not satisfy (OP). Let us assume that there exists an h- generator h0 with h0(1) > 0, such that Ih0 satis es the ordering property. Thus x y Ih0(x, y) = 1 h( 1) 0 (x h0(y)) = 1 h 1 0 (max (x h0(y), h0(1))) = 1 x h0(y) h0(1), but there exist x0, y0 (0, 1) such that 0 < y0 < x0 < h(1) and x0 h0(y0) < x0 < h0(1), i. e., Ih0(x0, y0) = 1, a contradiction to the assumed ordering property. (iv) This is a direct consequence of Proposition 6 and Corollaries 2.3, 2.5 from [1]. (v) For every h-generator the function given by (18) is a composition of continuous functions, so it is a continuous function. Example 6. As an example of h-generated implication which satis es (IP) consider the h-generator h(x) = 1 x 2 . By easy calculations we get Ih(x, y) = min(2 2x + xy, 1), x, y [0, 1]. Firstly see that x h(x) h(1) for every x [0, 1]. Therefore, by above theorem, Ih satis es (IP). Indeed, Ih(x, x) = min 2 2x + x2, 1 = 1 for all x [0, 1]. 6. THE INTERSECTIONS BETWEEN IF , IG AND IH Let us denote the following families of fuzzy implication: IF, f-generated implications such that f(0) = , IF, f-generated implications such that f(0) < , IF = IF, IF, , IG, g-generated implications such that g(1) = , IG, g-generated implications such that g(1) < , 176 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM IG = IG, IG, , IH,O h-generated implications Ih obtained from h such that h(1) = 0, IH,E h-generated implications Ih obtained from h such that h(1) > 0, IH = IH,O IH,E. Proposition 7. The following equalities are true: IF, IG = , (20) IF IG, = , (21) IF, = IG, , (22) IF, = IH,O, (23) IF, IH,O = , (24) IF IH,E = , (25) IG IH = . (26) P r o o f . (i) The equation (20) is the consequence of Proposition 2 (ii) and Proposition 4. (ii) Let I IF . Because of Theorem 4 (ii) we know that I(x, x) = 1 if and only if x = 0 or x = 1. On the other side, if we assume that I IG, , then there exists a g-generator such that I has the form (7) and g(1) < . Thus, for every x (0, 1) we get I g(x) g(1) , x = g( 1) g(1) g(x) g(x) = g( 1) (g(1)) = 1. Therefore we obtain (21). (iii) Let us assume that I IF, , i. e., there exists an f-generator f with f(0) = such that I has the form (2). Let us de ne the function g: [0, 1] [0, ] by g(x) = 1 f(x), x [0, 1], with the assumptions, that 1 0 = and 1 = 0. We see that g is a g-generator with g(1) = . Moreover g( 1)(x) = g 1(x) = f 1( 1 x). Hence, for every x, y [0, 1] we have Ig(x, y) = g 1 1 x g(y) = g 1 1 x 1 f(y) = f 1 (x f(y)) = I(x, y). Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 177 Conversely, if I IG, , then there exists a g-generator g with g(1) = such that I has the form (7). De ning the function f : [0, 1] [0, ] by f(x) = 1 g(x), x [0, 1], we get that f is an f-generator such that If = I. (iv) Let us assume that I IF, , i. e., there exists an f-generator f with f(0) < such that I has the form (2). Because of Remark 1 the function f1 de ned by (6) is an f generated implication such that If = If1 and f1(0) = 1. Therefore h = f1 can be seen as a h-generator, with h(1) = 0, such that If = Ih. Conversely, if I IH,O, i. e., there exists an h-generator h with h(1) = 0 such that I has the form (17), then h( 1) = h 1 and it can be seen as an f-generator with f(0) < . (v) The equation (24) is a consequence of (23). (vi) If I IF , then by Theorem 4 (ii) we get I(x, x) = 1 if and only if x = 0 or x = 1. On the other hand, if I IH,E, then there exists an h-generator h such that h(1) > 0. Therefore, by Theorem 9 (iii) I(x, x) = 1 x h(x) h(1), which is always true for all x [0, h(1)]. Therefore we get (25). (vii) From (22), (24) and (25) we see that IH IG, = . Similarly, from (20), (21) and (23) we see that IH IG, = . 7. THE INTERSECTIONS OF IF , IG, IH WITH IS,N In this section we investigate whether any of the families IF , IG, IH intersect with IS,N. In other words, if and when any of the members of the above families can be written as an (S, N)-implication of an appropriate t-conorm fuzzy negation pair. It is obvious from Proposition 4.1 in [1] that for a fuzzy implication I to be an (S, N)-implication it should satisfy the left neutrality property (NP), and the exchange principle (EP). We already know that the families IF , IG, IH all have (NP) and (EP). Hence, because of the characterizations of some subclasses of (S, N)-implications presented in Section 2, we need to check their natural negations. These was done in previous sections and we have the following results. 178 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM Theorem 10. If f is an f-generator, then the following statements are equivalent: (i) If is an (S, N)-implication. (ii) f(0) < . P r o o f . (i) = (ii) Let f be an f-generator such that f(0) = and assume that If is an (S, N)-implication generated from a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N. From Proposition 4.1 in [1] we get that NIf = N, but Proposition 2 (i) gives, that NIf is the G odel negation NG1. Hence, from Example 2 (i), it follows that If = IG1. Thus f 1(x f(y)) = y for all x (0, 1], y [0, 1], which implies x f(y) = f(y) for all x (0, 1], y [0, 1], a contradiction. (ii) = (i) Let f be an f-generator such that f(0) < . From Proposition 2 (ii) the natural negation NIf is a strict negation. Theorem 1 implies that If is an (S, N)-implication generated from some t-conorm and some strict negation. It is important, that in this case we can fully describe t-conorms and strict nega- tions from which the f-generated implications are obtained. Let us denote by the family of all increasing bijections : [0, 1] [0, 1]. We say that functions F, G: [0, 1]2 [0, 1] are -conjugate, if there exists a such that G = F , where F (x, y) := 1(F( (x), (y)), for all x, y [0, 1]. Corollary 1. If f(0) < , then the function S : [0, 1]2 [0, 1] de ned by S(x, y) = If(N 1 If (x), y), x, y [0, 1] is a strict t-conorm, i. e., it is -conjugate with the algebraic sum t-conorm SP. P r o o f . Let us assume that f is a decreasing generator such that f(0) < . Then the function f1 de ned by the formula (6) is a strict negation. We know also that If = If1, so we get S(x, y) = If(N 1 If (x), y) = If1(N 1 If1(x), y) = If1((If1(x, 0)) 1, y) = If1((f 1 1 ) 1(x), y) = If1(f1(x), y) = f 1 1 (f1(x) f1(y)), for all x, y [0, 1]. Let us de ne the function : [0, 1] [0, 1] by (x) = 1 f1(x) for all x [0, 1]. Evidently, is an increasing bijection. Moreover f 1 1 (x) = 1(1 x) for all x [0, 1]. This implies that S(x, y) = f 1 1 (f1(x) f1(y)) = f 1 1 ((1 (x)) (1 (y))) = 1( (x) + (y) (x) (y)) for all x, y [0, 1], i. e., S is -conjugate with the algebraic sum t-conorm SP. Therefore, by virtue of Theorem 1.9 in [5], S is a strict t-conorm. Yager s Classes of Fuzzy Implications: Some Properties and Intersections 179 This means, that for f(0) < we have If(x, y) = S(NIf (x), y) for x, y [0, 1], where S is -conjugate with the algebraic sum t-conorm SP. But NIf (x) = NIf1 (x) = f 1 1 (x) = 1(1 x), x [0, 1]. Hence, if f(0) < , then we do not obtain any new implication but only (S, N)- implication generated from -conjugate algebraic sum t-conorm for (x) = 1 f(x) f(0) , x [0, 1], and the strict negation N(x) = 1(1 x) for all x [0, 1]. Now, under the following restricted situations we can obtain S-implications. Theorem 11. Let f be an f-generator. The function If is an S-implication if and only if f(0) < and the function f1 de ned by (6) is a strong negation. Theorem 12. If g is a g-generator, then Ig is not an (S, N)-implication. P r o o f . Assume, that there exists a g-generator g such that Ig is an (S, N)- implication generated from a t-conorm S and a fuzzy negation N. We get that NIg = N, but Proposition 4 gives, that NIg is the G odel negation NG1. Hence, from Example 2 (i), it follows that Ig = IG1. Thus, for all x (0, 1], y [0, 1], g( 1) 1 x g(y) = y, which implies g 1 min 1 x g(y), g(1) = y. Let us take any x, y (0, 1), we get 1 x g(y) = g(y), a contradiction. Theorem 13. If h is an h-generator, then Ih is an (S, N)-implication generated from some t-conorm S and continuous negation N. P r o o f . Let h be an h-generator. By Theorem 6 the natural negation NIh is a continuous negation. By virtue of Theorem 1 we get that Ih is an (S, N)-implication generated from some t-conorm S and continuous negation N. Corollary 2. Let h be an h-generator. Ih is an (S, N)-implication generated from some t-conorm and some strict negation if and only if h(1) = 0. Corollary 3. Let h be an h-generator. Ih is an S-implication generated from some t-conorm and some strong negation if and only if h = h 1. 180 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM 8. THE INTERSECTIONS OF IF , IG, IH WITH IT In this section we investigate whether any of the families IF , IG, IH intersect with IT . In other words, if and when any of the members of the above families can be written as an R-implication of an appropriate left-continuous t-norm. It is obvious from the characterization of R-implications (see Theorem 2) that for a fuzzy implication I to be an R-implication it should be increasing in the second variable (I2), satisfy the ordering property (OP), satisfy the exchange principle (EP), and I(x, .) should be right-continuous for any x [0, 1]. We already know that the families IF , IG, IH all have (I2) and (EP). Hence we need to check for (OP) and the right-continuity of their members in the second variable. This was done again in previous sections and we have the following results. Because of Theorem 4 (iii) we get Theorem 14. If f is an f-generator, then If is not an R-implication. The next fact follows from Theorem 7. Theorem 15. If g is a g-generator of Ig, then the following statements are equiv- alent: (i) Ig is an R-implication. (ii) There exists a constant c (0, ) such that g(x) = c x for all x [0, 1]. (iii) Ig is the Goguen implication IGG. Finally, by Theorem 9 (iv), we have Theorem 16. If h is an h-generator, then Ih is not an R-implication. 9. CONCLUSION In this work, rstly we discussed some properties of the newly proposed families of fuzzy implications, viz., f-, g- and h-generated implications. In the light of the prop- erties that these classes possess, we investigated the intersections that exist amongst these classes of fuzzy implications, following which these investigations were ex- tended to study the intersections that exist among the above classes and two of the well-established classes of fuzzy implications, viz., (S, N)- and R-implications. Ta- ble 2 gives a summary of the results in this work, while Figure gives a diagrammatic representation of the intersections. A few interesting observations can be made with the help of the above table.

Intersections between families of fuzzy implications. IS,N IT IF, = IG, IF, = IH,O IF, IG, IGG IH,E IH,E If the f-generator is such that f(0) = , or equivalently a g-generator is such that g(1) = , then we get totally new families of fuzzy implications. On the other hand, if the f-generator is such that f(0) < , or equivalently the h-generator is such that h(1) = 0, then the f-generated, or equivalently the h-generated implication, becomes an (S, N)-implication for an appropriate t-conorm S and a continuous fuzzy negation N, but never is an R-implication. On the other hand, if the g-generator is such that g(1) < , then the g- generated implication does not become an (S, N)-implication and the only g-generated implication that is an R-implication is the one obtained from the g-generator g(x) = x. If h is an h-generator, then f(x) = ln h(1 x) is an f-generator. Now, let the h-generator be such that h(1) = 0, then f(0) = and f(1) = 0. Interestingly, the f-generated implication If is neither an R-implication nor an (S, N)-implication, whereas the h-generated implication Ih is an (S, N)- implication. Also because of the characterization of (S, N)-implications we see that h- generated implications are only another representation of a subclass of (S, N)- implications. 182 M. BACZY NSKI AND B. JAYARAM The full characterization of f-, g- and h-generated fuzzy implications is as yet unknown and is signi cant enough to merit attention. Also the intersections of f-, g- and h-generated implications with the other classes of fuzzy implication, like QL-, A- and Rn-implications (see [9, 11]) may turn out to be interesting. Our future endeavors will be along these lines. (Received March 25, 2006.) R E F E R E N C E S [1] M. Baczy nski and B. Jayaram: On the characterizations of (S, N)-implications.
