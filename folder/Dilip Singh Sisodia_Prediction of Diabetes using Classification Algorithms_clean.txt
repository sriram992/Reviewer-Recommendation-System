Introduction: Classi cation strategies are broadly used in the medical eld for classifying data into di erent classes according to some constrains comparatively an individual classi er. Diabetes is an illness which a ects the ability of the body in producing the hormone insulin, which in turn makes the metabolism of carbohydrate abnormal and raise the levels of glucose in the blood. In Diabetes a person generally su ers from high blood sugar. Intensify thirst, Intensify hunger and Frequent urination are some of the symptoms caused due to high blood sugar. Many complications occur if dia- betes remains untreated. Some of the severe complications include diabetic ketoacidosis and nonketotic hyperosmolar coma [14]. Diabetes is examined as a vital serious health matter during which the measure of sugar substance cannot Deepti Sisodia. Tel.: +0-000-000-0000 ; fax: +0-000-000-0000.

Many complications occur if diabetes remains untreated and unidenti ed. The tedious identifying process results in visiting of a patient to a diagnostic center and consulting doctor. But the rise in machine learning approaches solves this critical problem. The motive of this study is to design a model which can prognosticate the likelihood of diabetes in patients with maximum accuracy. Therefore three machine learning classi cation algorithms namely Decision Tree, SVM and Naive Bayes are used in this experiment to detect diabetes at an early stage. Experiments are performed on Pima Indians Diabetes Database (PIDD) which is sourced from UCI machine learning repository. The performances of all the three algorithms are evaluated on various measures like Precision, Accuracy, F-Measure, and Recall. Accuracy is measured over correctly and incorrectly classi ed instances. Results obtained show Naive Bayes outperforms with the highest accuracy of 76.30% comparatively other algorithms. These results are veri ed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves in a proper and systematic manner.

Diabetes is not only a ected by various factors like height, weight, hereditary factor and insulin but the major reason considered is sugar concentration among all factors. The early identi cation is the only remedy to stay away from the complications [29]. Many researchers are conducting experiments for diagnosing the diseases using various classi cation algorithms of machine learning approaches like J48, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Decision Table etc. as researches have proved that machine-learning algorithms [1],[12],[6] works better in diagnosing di erent diseases. Data Mining [15], [2] and Machine learning algorithms gain its strength due to the capability of managing a large amount of data to combine data from several di erent sources and integrating the background information in the study [8]. This research work focuses on pregnant women su ering from diabetes. In this work, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Decision Tree machine learning classi cation algorithms are used and evaluated on the PIDD dataset to nd the prediction of diabetes in a patient. Experimental performance of all the three algorithms are compared on various measures and achieved good accuracy [11]. The remaining of the research discussion is organized as follows: Section-II briefs Related Work of various classi- cation techniques for prediction of diabetes, Section-III describes the Methodology and brief discussion of Dataset used, Section-IV discusses evaluated Results, and Section-V determines the Conclusion of the research work. 2. Related Work: Sajida et al. in [20] discusses the role of Adaboost and Bagging ensemble machine learning methods [18] using J48 decision tree as the basis for classifying the Diabetes Mellitus and patients as diabetic or non diabetic, based on diabetes risk factors. Results achieved after the experiment proves that, Adaboost machine learning ensemble technique outperforms well comparatively bagging as well as a J48 decision tree. Orabi et al. in [19] designed a system for diabetes prediction, whose main aim is the prediction of diabetes a candidate is su ering at a particular age. The proposed system is designed based on the concept of machine learning, by applying decision tree. Obtained results were satisfactory as the designed system works well in predicting the diabetes incidents at a particular age, with higher accuracy using Decision tree[22], [7]. Pradhan et al in [4] used Genetic programming (GP) for the training and testing of the database for prediction of diabetes by employing Diabetes data set which is sourced from UCI repository. Results achieved using Genetic Programming [25], [21] gives optimal accuracy as compared to other implemented techniques. There can be signi cant improve in accuracy by taking less time for classi er generation. It proves to be useful for diabetes prediction at low cost. Rashid et al. in [28] designed a prediction model with two sub-modules to predict diabetes-chronic disease. ANN (Arti cial Neural Network) is used in the rst module and FBS (Fasting Blood Sugar) is used in the second module. Decision Tree (DT)[10] is used to detect the symptoms of diabetes on patient s health. Nongyao et al. in [17] applied an algorithm which classi es the risk of diabetes mellitus. To ful ll the objective au- thor has employed four following renowned machine learning classi cation methods namely Decision Tree, Arti cial Neural Networks, Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes. For improving the robustness of designed model Bagging and Boosting techniques are used. Experimentation results shows the Random Forest algorithm gives optimum results among all the algorithms employed. 3. Methodology Used: 3.1. Model Diagram: Proposed procedure is summarized in gure-1 below in the form of model diagram. The gure shows the ow of the research conducted in constructing the model. 1580 Deepti Sisodia et al. / Procedia Computer Science 132 (2018) 1578 1585 Fig. 1. Proposed Model Diagram 3.2. Brief Description of Algorithms Used: 3.2.1. Support Vector Machine (SVM): SVM is one of the standard set of supervised machine learning model employed in classi cation. Given a two-class training sample the aim of a support vector machine is to nd the best highest-margin separating hyperplane between the two classes[26]. For better generalization hyperplane should not lies closer to the data points belong to the other class. Hyperplane should be selected which is far from the data points from each category. The points that lie nearest to the margin of the classi er are the support vectors [27]. The Accuracy of the experiment is evaluated using WEKA interface. The SVM nds the optimal separating hy- perplane by maximizing the distance between the two decision boundaries. Mathematically, we will maximize the distance between the hyperplane which is de ned by wT x + b = 1 and the hyperplane de ned by wT x + b = 1 This distance is equal to 2 w . This means we want to solve max 2 w . Equivalently we want min w | 2. The SVM should also correctly classify all x(i), which means yi(wT xi + b) >= 1, i {1, , N}. The evaluated performance of SVM algorithm for prediction of Diabetes [16], [30] using Confusion Matrix is as follows: Table 1. Confusion Matrix of SVM A B A-Tested Negative 500 0 B-Tested Positive 268 0 3.2.2. Naive Bayes Classi er: Naive Bayes is a classi cation technique with a notion which de nes all features are independent and unrelated to each other. It de nes that status of a speci c feature in a class does not a ect the status of another feature. Since it is based on conditional probability it is considered as a powerful algorithm employed for classi cation purpose. It works well for the data with imbalancing problems and missing values. Naive Bayes [24] is a machine learning classi er which employs the Bayes Theorem. Using Bayes theorem posterior probability P(C|X) can be calculated from P(C),P(X) and P(X|C) [23]. Therefore, P(C|X) = (P(X|C) P(C))/P(X) Where, P(C|X) = target class s posterior probability . P(X|C) = predictor class s probability. P(C) = class C s probability being true. P(X) = predictor s prior probability. The evaluated performance of Naive Bayes algorithm using Confusion Matrix is as follows: Deepti Sisodia et al. / Procedia Computer Science 132 (2018) 1578 1585 1581 Table 2. Confusion Matrix of Naive Bayes A B A-Tested Negative 422 78 B-Tested Positive 104 164 3.2.3. Decision Tree Classi er: Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used to solve classi cation problems. The main objective of using Decision Tree in this research work is the prediction of target class using decision rule taken from prior data. It uses nodes and internodes for the prediction and classi cation. Root nodes classify the instances with di erent features. Root nodes can have two or more branches while the leaf nodes represent classi cation. In every stage, Decision tree chooses each node by evaluating the highest information gain among all the attributes [11]. The evaluated performance of Decision Tree technique using Confusion Matrix is as follows: Table 3. Confusion Matrix of Decision Tree A B A-Tested Negative 407 93 B-Tested Positive 108 160 3.3. Dataset Used: In this work WEKA tool [3], [9] is used for performing the experiment. WEKA is a software which is designed in the country New Zealand by University of Waikato, which includes a collection of various machine learning methods for data classi cation, clustering, regression, visualization etc. One of the biggest advantages of using WEKA is that it can be personalized according to the requirements. The main aim of this study is the prediction of the patient a ected by diabetes using the WEKA tool by using the medical database PIDD. Table-4 shows a brief description of the dataset. Table 4.
