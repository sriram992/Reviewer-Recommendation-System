OPEN FORUM Crime detection and criminal identi cation in India using data mining techniques Devendra Kumar Tayal Arti Jain Surbhi Arora Surbhi Agarwal Tushar Gupta Nikhil Tyagi Received: 15 July 2013 / Accepted: 10 March 2014 / Published online: 1 April 2014  Springer-Verlag London 2014 Abstract In the current paper, we propose an approach for the design and implementation of crime detection and criminal identi cation for Indian cities using data mining techniques. Our approach is divided into six modules, namely data extraction (DE), data preprocessing (DP), clustering, Google map representation, classi cation and WEKA implementation. First module, DE extracts the unstructured crime dataset from various crime Web sour- ces, during the period of 2000 2012. Second module, DP cleans, integrates and reduces the extracted crime data into structured 5,038 crime instances. We represent these instances using 35 prede ned crime attributes. Safeguard measures are taken for the crime database accessibility. Rest four modules are useful for crime detection, criminal identi cation and prediction, and crime veri cation, respectively. Crime detection is analyzed using k-means clustering, which iteratively generates two crime clusters that are based on similar crime attributes. Google map improves visualization to k-means. Criminal identi cation and prediction is analyzed using KNN classi cation. Crime veri cation of our results is done using WEKA. WEKA veri es an accuracy of 93.62 and 93.99 % in the formation of two crime clusters using selected crime attributes. Our approach contributes in the betterment of the society by helping the investigating agencies in crime detection and criminals identi cation, and thus reducing the crime rates.

It has been observed that criminals commit crimes at any place and in any form. One of the well-known crimes in the world is the terror attack on World Trade Centre on Sep- tember 11, 2001 (Okonkwo and Enem 2011). Some well- known crimes in India are given here in chronological order of their occurrence (1) Jessica Lal who worked as a celebrity barmaid in Delhi was shot dead on April 30, 1999.1 (2) Nithari serial murders in Uttar Pradesh during 2005 2006, where the dismembered bodies of several children were found in the sewers.2 (3) Terrorist attacks in Mumbai on November 26, 2008, by terrorist organization that killed 166 people and wounded at least 308.3 (4) Rape case in Delhi on December 16, 2012, in which the victim who was a paramedical student died from her injuries while D.

This reveals that crimes terri cally affect not only the victims but also the people of the country as a whole. So, the check on crimes and target to the criminals are inevitable that need to be performed by the law enforcement agencies to secure the country. These agencies along with additional computer data analysts are respon- sible for unambiguous and competent crime investigation from the voluminous crime data. We therefore propose an approach for crime detection and criminal identi cation (CDCI) using data mining techniques (DMT) (Chen et al. 2004; Adderley et al. 2007; Thongtae and Srisuk 2008; Yu et al. 2008; Malathi and Baboo 2011; Malathi et al. 2011; Hussain et al. 2012) for Indian cities. In this paper, the proposed CDCI approach is divided into six modules, namely (1) data extraction (DE) (Wit- ten et al. 2011; Han et al. 2012), which extracts the unstructured crime data from various crime Web sources viz. National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 5 Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)6 and other Web sources during the period of 2000 2012.7, 8 (2) data preprocessing (DP) (Malathi and Baboo 2011; Malathi et al. 2011; Han et al. 2012) cleans, integrates and reduces the extracted crime data into structured 5,038 crime instances. We represent these instances by our 35 crime attributes. (3) Clustering (Green et al. 1976; Sayal and Kumar 2011) using k-means (Kulis and Jordan 2011; Hornik et al. 2012; Kaur et al. 2012), which groups crime instances iteratively into two clusters with similar attributes for crime detection. (4) Google Map Application Programming Interface (GMAPI), which embeds Google maps through JAVA9 Netbeans for user-friendly and improved visual aids to k-means.10 (5) Classi cation (Witten et al. 2011; Han et al. 2012) using K-NN (KNN) (Okonkwo and Enem 2011), which discovers similarities among different crimes and organizes them into prede ned classes for criminal iden- ti cation and prediction. (6) WEKA (Malathi et al. 2011), which uses JAVA-based graphical user interface for crime veri cation of our k-means results.11 CDCI here uses an integrated technology that makes it more secure and differentiated from others. Password- protected user interface is designed to access the tool, to view and analyze the generated results. In case the user wants to access the criminals database, he needs to pro- vide his identity proof. Once veri ed and permitted by the tool s administrator, the user can access the criminals database. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 discuses about the related literature review and its shortcomings. Section 3 discusses about the proposed CDCI methodology. Section 4 discusses about the CDCI experimentation and associated results. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes the paper. 2 Background and related work Crimes in India are stoked up at an alarming rate, and criminals are opting for queer activities to commit them. Newspapers, Web blogs, etc. are day to day lled with var- ious crime incidents. Some of the mysti ed crimes that occurred inIndia in last couple of yearsare mentioned here.12 A professor was beaten to death by his own students in Ujjain, Madhya Pradesh. A gang of nine taxi drivers from Gurgaon, Haryana, robbed and killed at least 35 people after offering them lift. Unruly mob stripped and molested a girl in full public view at the Gateway of India, Mumbai, on the New Year eve. Days after horrible Nithari killing, 4 decomposed bodies of children were recovered from abandoned godown in Punjab. Sexually assaulted teenage girls in the Kashmir valley are still struggling to cope up with trauma. These incidents reveal how crimes are becoming a growing blight in India and have become a dominant fact of an Indian life as well. Some responsible factors that prevail in India for sheer increase in crimes are poverty, migration, unemployment, frustration, starvation, illiteracy, corruption, nepotism, in ation, etc. Impact of such crimes is that today people living in India now focus their eyes toward crime investi- gation agencies and security agencies to check and control crimes. Currently, physical investigation by agencies has the probability to ignore and neglect the supportive crime features. Most of these agencies are searching manually the 4 Delhi rape case, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2269725/ Indian-teenager-accused-Delhi-gang-rape-faces-maximum-year-jail- term.html Accessed on April 28, 2013. 5 National Crime Records Bureau, http://ncrb.gov.in Accessed on March 10, 2013. 6 Committee to Protect Journalists, http://www.cpj.org Accessed on March 20, 2013. 7 Crime alert, http://www.crimealert.org Accessed on March 25, 2013. 8 NSW bureau of crime statistics and research, http://www.bocsar. nsw.gov.au Accessed on March 22, 2013. 9 Jin F, Wang W, Xiao Y, Pan Z Proposal of Crime Data Mining Project. https:// lebox.vt.edu/users/xykid/dataAnalysisProject/Check point-II_Jin_Xiao_Pan_Wang.pdf.

Few of them work with the help of computer data analysts and are responsible for crime detection, criminal identi cation and prediction, and crime veri cation to ensure safety to the citizens of India. To contribute in this aspect, we propose our CDCI approach using DMT for Indian cities by consideration of selected crime features. Our methodology can help these agencies to lter crime database to nd out the most probable crimi- nals. This will save a lot of time for the agencies. Literature survey details that earlier work related to the crime investigation carries some intrinsic limitations. Some of the authors have discussed primary clustering (Chen et al. 2004; Kulis and Jordan 2011; Malathi and Baboo 2011; Malathi et al. 2011; Sayal and Kumar 2011) and classi cation (Okonkwo and Enem 2011) techniques for crime detection, criminal identi cation theoretically; however, none of them provides a sound implementation for the same. Although some papers (Nath 2006; Malathi and Baboo 2011; Malathi etal.2011) discussapplication ofk-meansfor crime detection, but these and other works (Ehlers 1998; Visher and Weisburd 1998; Gorr and Harries 2003; Gorr et al. 2003; Chen et al. 2004; Hussain et al. 2012) are de cient in integration among crime detection, criminal identi cation and prediction, and crime veri cation. Malathi et al. (2011) work with crime attributes number of crimes of a particular crime type, e.g., murder and burglary, versus years. Our CDCI in addition to Malathi et al. (2011) works with attributes number_- of_crimes_committed_in_year versus crime_year (please refer Sect. 4). These crime attributes are considered as fol- lows: (1) independent of attributes crime_location and crime_type ; (2) dependent on attribute crime_location, but independent of attribute crime_type, etc. Nath (2006) tries to detect crime suspects based on theirraces, age and sex. On the other hand, our CDCI speculates suspects based on the ne-grained attributes suspect_name, suspect_age, suspect_sex, suspect_facial_feature, suspect_other_- physical_feature and suspect_nationality. Mande et al. (2012a, b) states that criminal identi cation is based on autocorrelation/Gaussian mixture models. They solely depend on the eye-witness information. They con ne to only one state of India, i.e., Andhra Pradesh for criminal records. Our CDCI works on crime data of several Indian cities that are selected based on their crime rates. Jin et al. (see footnote 9) in their proposal de ne the position of crime events with longitude and latitude using k-means. They visualize intra- cluster distance through Google map using different colors. Our CDCI de nes the formation of clusters rstly using k- means and then using GMAPI. GMAPI uses the crime attributes crime_location, crime_location_longi- tude, crime_location_latitude and number_- of_crimes_committed_in_location (please refer Sect. 4). Okonkwo and Enem (2011) confer about terrorism 9/11 attack as a type of crime. They recommend government to set up data mining agencies within the law enforcement agen- cies where various criminal data should be consolidated and mined. They focus on KNN s theoretical details, but there is no implementation provided. Li and Juhola (2014) say that crime research is an area that can bene t from better visu- alization and DMT. Our CDCI proposal provides a consol- idated and visualized approach for crime detection, criminal identi cation and prediction, and crime veri cation to shield India from heinous crimes. 3 Methodology This section is divided into two subsections: Sects. 3.1 and 3.2. Section 3.1 describes the CDCI dataset for applying DMT and Sect. 3.1.1 for CDCI data protection. Section 3.2 describes the proposed CDCI approach. 3.1 CDCI dataset First of all, we generate the CDCI crime dataset through two sequential steps (1) DE extracts the unstructured crime data from various crime Web sources, namely NCRB (see footnote 5), CPJ (see footnote 6) and other (see foot- notes 7, 8) Web sources during the period of 2000 2012. (2) DP cleans, integrates and reduces the extracted crime data into structured 5,038 crime instances (.csv format). The structured CDCI crime dataset is represented using 35 crime attributes. The formulated dataset is implemented using two JAVA tools (1) Netbeans for crime detection, criminal identi cation and prediction. (2) WEKA for crime veri cation. Some of the crime attributes are men- tioned in Sect. 4. Figure 1 shows the CDCI sample dataset. 3.1.1 CDCI data protection Crime experts use their knowledge skills, intuition and past experiences when they deal with criminals and associated crime cases. They are not deviated by the incorrect crime data (e.g., person who is not a criminal but wrongly iden- ti ed as criminal by the system). On the other hand, our machine learning model is highly dependent on the input of the crime data. To reduce this risk, we have extracted the crime data from reliable sources such as NCRB and CPJ. Day by day, crime records are expanding in size which gives rise to some key problems such as data storage (Kor- ukonda 2007) and data reliability. (1) Data storage aids in ef cient storing of the crime database. But data storage need not be compatible and feasible at all times due to computers processing limitations. (2) Data need not be reliable when an agency has the incorrect crime data. In these scenarios, our data mining-based model, i.e., CDCI results may deviate AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 119 123 from their actual analysis. To reduce these risks, we have tried to compress the dataset using DP techniques and DE is done from reliable sources. Some measures that are taken care to safeguard the per- sonal information comprise of the data quality process. This phenomenon states that personal data should not be dis- closed, but should be relevant to the purposes for which it is intended to be used and to the extent necessary for those purposes be accurate, complete and kept up-to-date. Keeping this in mind, we provide two types of login in our CDCI tool Admin login and Guest login. Admin login is provided to the administrator of the CDCI. Admin has complete authority to access the entire criminal database and personal information also. In case the user wants to access the criminals database, he needs to provide his identity proof. Once veri ed and permitted by the tool s administrator, the user gains the right to access the criminals database. Guest login is for limited access and is provided according to the type of the user to view/analysis the CDCI tool or other related information. CDCI is thus more secure and differ- entiated from existing crime investigating processes. 3.2 Proposed CDCI approach This section depicts the work ow of our proposed CDCI (Fig. 2) using DMT for Indian cities. The work ow starts with DE step followed by DP step, which generated CDCI database. This database is then supplied to other CDCI modules clustering and classi cation. CDCI clustering uses k-means which replaces missing value of an instance attribute with mean/mode that is computed from other given instances over the same attribute. k-Means groups crime instances iteratively into clusters with similar attributes for crime detection. CDCI clustering is then followed by GMAPI, which embeds Google maps through Netbeans for user-friendly and improved visual aid to k- means. The CDCI classi cation uses KNN which discovers similarities among different crimes and organizes them into prede ned classes for criminal identi cation and predic- tion. CDCI then employs WEKA for crime veri cation of our k-means results. To do the same, WEKA converts the CDCI database (.csv) format to WEKA workable (.arff) format (see footnote 11). WEKA veri es high accuracy in the formation of two crime clusters using selected crime attributes (please refer Sect. 4). CDCI being an integration of various data mining modules such as DE, data preprocessing, clustering, visu- alization and classi cation. It thus gains insight into the crimes and facilitates into the detection of prime crime suspects by ltering out the huge crime data. CDCI can help the police and justice departments to narrow down the identi cation of criminals. This in turn will reduce the cost and time of crime investigation. 4 Experimentation and results Whenever a crime takes place, detection organizations look into their criminal database to identify the criminals. In this process, each and every criminal get investigated by them, whereas our CDCI uses DMT, e.g., k-means and KNN, which improve the ltration of huge crime database for the identi cation of prime crime suspects. Thus, the investi- gation is set to be impact upon and in uenced by the reduction in time and effort by our CDCI development. Hence, this section discusses about the experimentation Fig. 1 CDCI sample database 120 AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 123 and results that our CDCI performs using two tools Netbeans 7.2.1 (see footnote 10) and WEKA 3.6.2 (see footnote 11). This section is divided into ve subsections: Sects. 4.1 4.5 as mentioned below. 4.1 CDCI for selection of Indian cities CDCI approach chooses seven Indian cities (Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Pune, Jaipur, Hyderabad and Bengaluru) based on the percentage of their crime rates in diminishing order (please refer Fig. 3). Total numbers of crimes in these cities during 2000 2012 are analyzed with line graphs (please refer Fig. 4). Figure 4 is generated from CDCI crime dataset that uses the attribute crime_year (represented by Years on X- axis) versus attribute number_of_crimes_committed_in_- year (represented by Number of Crimes on Y-axis). 4.2 CDCI k-means implementation CDCI searches for immanent patterns and relations in the given crime data by using the k-means and GMAPI tech- niques. These techniques provide an overview of large amount of the crime data and facilitate in handling, searching and retrieving of the desired crime information. CDCI can also be useful for crime prevention. Clusters are formulated for seven Indian cities that are selected based on their crime rates. Also, particular crime based on location type can help the investigating agencies to take proper security measures against that crime. For example, Delhi has the highest number of rape reports among the Indian cities. So security of cials should arrange special security for women in Delhi, which may prevent the crime occurrence to sensitive areas to some extent. In this section, CDCI implements k-means clustering. Clustering is done through Netbeans in Sect. 4.2.1 as Case 1 to Case 4 (as mentioned below) for crime detection in India. To de ne these cases, k-means uses crime attributes crime_year, crime_type and crime_location. And Netbeans derive an additional important crime attribute number_ of_crimes_committed_in_year from the attribute crime_year. Fig. 3 Crime rates in % of seven Indian cities Fig. 4 Number of crimes versus years for seven Indian cities Fig. 2 CDCI work ow AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 121 123 4.2.1 CDCI k-means for Case 1 to Case 4 Case 1 crime detection in India during 2000 2012 k-Means aims to group objects (crimes in India during 2000 2012) as A number of crimes in 2000, B number of crimes in 2001, C number of crimes in 2002 L number of crimes in 2011, M number of crimes in 2012 into precise clusters. Clusters are based on the two crime attributes crime_- year and number_of_crimes_committed_in_year irre- spective of attributes crime_location and crime_type. We choose the number of clusters = 2 and name them as G1 and G2. Initial seed points (or centroids) of these clusters are c1 and c2 that are based on ( crime_year, number_- of_crimes_committed_in_year ). Here, we select c1 as (2002, 233) and c2 as (2009, 376). We assign each object (A, B, C N, M) to that cluster (G1 or G2), which has the minimum distance with respect to object. Figure 5 shows that objects A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I belong to G1 and F, J, K, L, M belong to cluster G2. Since clusters are generated itera- tively from CDCI crime dataset. So, at the end of rst iter- ation, we get c1 as (2004.17, 246.16) and c2 as (2007.57, 508.71). Figure 6 shows that objects A, B, C, D, E, G, H, I, J belong to G1 and F, K, L, M belong to cluster G2. Similarly, at the end of seconditeration, we get c1 as (2004.0, 278.0) and c2 as (2009.5, 633.08). Figure 7 shows that objects A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J belong to G1 and K, L, M belong to cluster G2. At the end of third iteration, we get c1 as (2004.5, 294.2) and c2 as (2011.0,698.0).Figure 8showsthat objects A,B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J belong to G1 and K, L, M belong to cluster G2. We now compare the grouping of the last iteration and the current iteration which reveals that the objects does not move group anymore (please refer Figs. 7 and 8). Thus, the Fig. 5 CDCI k-means clusters with initial centroids Fig. 6 CDCI k-means clusters at the end of rst iteration Fig. 7 CDCI k-means clusters at the end of second iteration Fig. 8 CDCI k-means clusters at the end of third iteration Fig. 9 CDCI for crimes in Delhi (2000 2012) 122 AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 123 computation of k-means clustering reaches to its stability, and no more iteration is needed. It is pertinent to note that these clusters are independent of attributes crime_loca- tion and crime_type. Case 2 crime detection in Delhi during 2000 2012 Clus- ters are generated to detect the number of crimes in a speci ed location (say Delhi) during 2000 2012 (please refer Fig. 9). Here again, attributes crime_year and number_of_crimes_committed_in_year are used to generate clusters, but they depend on the attribute crime_location = Delhi and independent of the attribute crime_type. In the same way, for other crime locations in India, similar clusters can be generated. Case 3 crime detection of type murders in India during 2000 2012 Clusters are generated to detect the number of crimes of speci c type (say murder) during 2000 2012 in India (please refer Fig. 10). Here also, attributes crime_year and number_of_crimes_committed_in_ year are used to generate clusters, but they depend on attribute crime_type = Murder and independent of attribute crime_location. In the same way, for other crime types in India, similar clusters can be generated. Case 4 crime detection of type murders in Delhi during 2000 2012 As we generate clusters for Case 1 to Case 3, similar clusters can be generated for this case where attri- butes crime_type and crime_location are speci ed explicitly. This case helps to detect which crime type is at Fig. 10 CDCI clusters for murders in India (2000 2012) Fig. 11 CDCI performs GMAPI for selected Indian cities AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 123 123 peak in a given location. For instance, Delhi has high crime rate for murders during 2000 2012. 4.3 CDCI GMAPI implementation In order to enhance k-means results, CDCI performs GMAPI. GMAPI embeds Google maps through Netbeans (see footnote 10) for user-friendly and improved visual aid to k-means. Figure 11 shows total number of crimes (dur- ing 2000 2012 in seven selected Indian cities) as cluster values, along with cities within the map of India. For this purpose, we choose the crime attributes for GMAPI as crime_location, number_of_crimes_committed_in_ location, crime_location_longitude and crime_loca- tion_latitude. The two attributes crime_location_longi- tude and crime_location_latitude are used to plot the crime location markers on Google map, for example, crime_location_longitude = 28.63N and crime_loca- tion_latitude = 77.22E for crime marker to be placed at crime_location = Delhi. Rest two attributes crime_ location and number_of_crimes_committed_in_loca- tion are used for crime detection during 2000 2012. Now, if we want to know about the crimes in Indian cities for a particular year (say 2012), we can directly locate with GMAPI (please refer Fig. 12). Clusters with different num- ber of crimes are represented by different color markers as: : blue color cluster for number of crimes (0 50) : orange color cluster for number of crimes (50 100) : red color cluster for number of crimes ([100) In GMAPI, we neither require to select the number of clusters ahead of time nor there need to select the initial centroids. Also, however large is the crime dataset, GMAPI easily runs on that data. GMAPI creates crime clusters that identify the hot spots of crime locations. Thus, GMAPI speeds the crime investigation and points to enforce secu- rity measures in those effected locations. Fig. 12 CDCI crime clusters in GMAPI for year 2012 124 AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 123 4.4 CDCI KNN implementation KNN approach stores all available objects and classi es new objects based on the similarity measure (Han et al. 2012). In our paper, we have used KNN for criminals identi cation by looking at the past crimes and nding similar ones that match the current crime based on k (k: number of nearest neighbors matched). In Fig. 14, output of 12 prime suspects is shown with KNN when only three input attributes ( crime_type = Assault && vic- tim_sex = Male && vicitm_age = Young) are given and rest of the attributes have null values. We have designed the user interface to input the crime attribute values for KNN (please refer Fig. 13). Here, KNN is shown to apply on only 6 attributes; however, it is valid for all 35 attributes but for the sake of brevity it is not shown here. We can say that CDCI uses KNN for criminals identi cation by ltering the number of suspected crim- inals. Criminals may then be executed and prosecuted by the law and justice of India. This may currently take long time, may be years, depending on the severity of the crimes. Again for criminal prediction, KNN assigns the new case to the same crime class to which most of its neighbors belong. When a new criminal is observed with no past records, then CDCI identi es its nearest neighbors, i.e., criminals with the same crime pattern. KNN assumes that Fig. 13 KNN user interface in CDCI Fig. 14 Criminal identi cation in CDCI using KNN AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 125 123 in order to predict criminal, CDCI looks for records with similar predictor values in the crime database that is nearest. But if no pattern is matched, then the new criminal is added in our database. 4.5 CDCI using WEKA WEKA is a useful tool in the analysis of the real-world datasets. Since WEKA (please refer Fig. 15) undergoes testing of several data mining algorithms, so it acts as a base system in the veri cation process. In this section, the results of k-means clusters (as obtained in Sect. 4.2.1, Case 1) are veri ed with WEKA (please refer Table 1). WEKA veri es an accuracy of 93.62 and 93.99 % in the formation of two crime clusters using the selected crime attributes. Error Calculation: G1 Cluster = MOD(2,445 - 2,289) / 2445 = 0.0638 G2 Cluster = MOD(2,593 - 2,749) / 2593 = 0.0601 So, Accuracy Measure: G1 Cluster = 93.62 % G2 Cluster = 93.99 % 5 Conclusion Crimes in India are rising at an alarming rate because of the factors such as increase in poverty, migration, unemploy- ment, frustration, illiteracy and corruption. Crime investi- gating agencies search the database of criminals manually or with some computer data analyst which is a tedious process and takes much more time. So to contribute toward combating crimes and to identify criminals, we propose an integrated technology of CDCI using DMT for Indian cit- ies. Selection of seven Indian cities is based on their crime rates. Our CDCI extracts unstructured crime data from various crime Web sources and then preprocessed the crime data into structured 5,038 instances that are repre- sented using 35 prede ned crimes attributes. Password- protected user interface is designed to access the CDCI tool. CDCI then applies k-means clustering for crime detection during 2000 2012 through four cases. Case 1 detects crimes in India irrespective of crime location and crime type. Case 2 detects crimes in speci c location, e.g., Delhi, irrespective of crime type. Case 3 detects crimes of speci c type, e.g., murders, irrespective of crime location. And Case 4 detects crimes of speci c type and in speci c location. To enhance k-means results, the CDCI performs GMAPI which embeds Google maps through Netbeans. CDCI also applies KNN classi cation for criminals identi cation and prediction. KNN looks at the past crimes and nds similar ones that match the current crime based on the number of nearest neighbors matched. CDCI then uses WEKA to verify k-means, Case 1 results. We Fig. 15 WEKA tool in CDCI Table 1 k-Means clusters (G1 and G2) Cluster ID k-means (WEKA) k-means (code) G1 2,445 2,289 G2 2,593 2,749 126 AI & Soc (2015) 30:117 127 123 measure an accuracy of 93.62 and 93.99 %, respectively, in the formation of two crime clusters using selected crime attributes. Investigating agencies can utilize our proposed data mining tool to ease their crime investigation process. CDCI can speed up the crime solving process by processing and ltering the voluminous crime data within a short span of time. Thus, CDCI can aid the law enforcement agencies to enforce the security of citizens of India. 6 Future work In future, we can enhance data privacy, reliability, accu- racy and other security measures of our crime-based data mining system. We shall also collaborate with security agencies in India. References Adderley R, Townsley M, Bond J (2007) Use of data mining techniques to model crime scene investigator performance.
