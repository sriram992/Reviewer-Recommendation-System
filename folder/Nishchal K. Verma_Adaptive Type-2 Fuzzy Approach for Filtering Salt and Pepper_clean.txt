Dhar , Pooja Agrawal , and Nishchal K. Verma Abstract This paper proposes a novel adaptive Type-2 fuzzy lter for removing salt and pepper noise from the images. The lter removes noise in two steps. In the rst step, the pixels are categorized as good or bad based on their primary membership function (MF) values in the respective lter window. In this paper, two approaches have been proposed for nding threshold between good or bad pixels by designing primary MFs. a) MFs with distinct Means and same Variance and b) MFs with distinct Means and distinct Variances. The primary MFs of the Type-2 fuzzy set is chosen as Gaussian membership functions. Whereas, in the second step, the pixels categorized as bad are denoised. For denoising, a novel Type-1 fuzzy ap- proach based on a weighted mean of good pixels is presented in the paper. The proposed lter is validated for several standard images with the noise level as low as 20% to as high as 99%. The results show that the proposed lter performs better in terms of peak signal-noise-ratio values compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms.

INTRODUCTION Removing noise from images is an essential task since good quality images are required in various applications such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, recognition, etc. There are several types of noises that can degrade the quality of images. One such type is salt and pepper (SAP) noise. This noise can be represented as randomly occurring white (1) and black (0) pixels in the image. The main sources of this noise are electrical conditions, light intensity, imperfection in imaging sensors, transmission errors, etc. [1], [2]. The state-of-the-art suggests that various approaches have been pro- posed for removal of SAP noise. Median lter [3] and adaptive median lter [4] are popularly used for SAP noise removal. In these approaches, noisy pixel intensity is replaced by the median of intensities of neigh- borhood pixels. Although these lters are ef cient to remove noise but fails to preserve details of the image due to blurring at the edges. The weighted mean, weighted fuzzy mean, adaptive fuzzy mean, and itera- tive fuzzy lters are also used to reduce SAP noise [5] [8]. In all these methods, the problem lies with weighing of good pixels that may lead to loss of actual image details to a certain extent. Ahmed et al. [9] have proposed an iterative adaptive fuzzy lter for removal of high-density SAP noise. The drawback of this approach seems to be assignment of weight to good pixels in window during denoising using inverse distance weighting function. Therefore, this method fails to preserve Manuscript received October 2, 2017; accepted February 2, 2018. Date of publication February 12, 2018; date of current version October 4, 2018.

The other problem of this method is use of many heuristic parameters such as , K1, and K2 that are not consistent to give best result for different noise levels. To overcome these problems, others have proposed fuzzy lter based on Type-2 fuzzy set [10] [12]. Liang and Mendel [13] proposed Type-2 adaptive lter using an unnormalized Type-2 Takagi Sugeno Kang fuzzy logic system for the application of equalization of a non- linear time-varying channel. John et al. [14] have applied neurofuzzy clustering techniques for classifying images where an image is repre- sented by Type-2 fuzzy set. Yldrm et al. [15] have proposed a Type-2 fuzzy lter for suppressing noise in the image while at the same time preserving thin lines, edges, texture, and other useful features within the image. In [16] and [17], Type-2 fuzzy lter for edge, corner de- tector, and noise reduction from the color images have been proposed. The drawback of these methods are formation of big fuzzy rule base (FRB) matrices and use of rigorous fuzzi cation and defuzzi cation, which increase computation time and complexity of the lter. The lter window is also not adaptive with respect to the noise level. In this paper, we propose an adaptive Type-2 fuzzy lter with a combination of Type-1 fuzzy set to eliminate the problem of FRB matrix formation, fuzzi cation, and defuzzi cation. The proposed lter consists of two steps. In the rst step, pixels are categorized as good or bad. In the second step, the pixel categorized as bad in step-1 is denoised. For step-1, two approaches based on adaptive threshold using primary MF values of Type-2 fuzzy logic are developed. Either of the two approaches may be used in the rst step. In the second step, for denoising the bad pixels, good pixels are weighted in their respective lter window. To assign proper weight to good pixel, a novel Type-1 fuzzy logic based approach is proposed. The proposed lter is simple and very effective to remove SAP noise. This lter also preserves image features such as edges, corners, etc. Moreover, it doesn t require any parameter tuning. The proposed lter is validated on several standard grayscale images and provides improved peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). The paper is organized as follows. The required preliminaries for proposed methodology are presented in Section II. The proposed adap- tive Type-2 fuzzy lter is explained in Section III. In Section IV, experimental results, discussion, and comparison with existing lters are presented. The concluding remarks are drawn in Section V. II. PRELIMINARIES A. Type-2 Fuzzy Set A Type-2 fuzzy set is an extension of Type-1 fuzzy set, which was originally introduced by Zadeh [10]. The set theoretic operations and properties of membership grades are evaluated in the form of alge- braic product and sum given by Mizumoto and Tanaka [11]. Karnik and Mendel in [12] have extended the concept of Type-2 set for per- 1063-6706 2018 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.

The Type-2 fuzzy set M H ij , is characterized by membership function M H i j (pij , M H i j ) and is de ned as M H ij = { (pij , M H i j ), M H i j (pij , M H i j ) pij I M H i j Jp i j [0 1] } (1) where 0 M H i j , M H i j (pij , M H i j ) 1 and I is the universe of dis- course. B. Mean of k-Middle The mean of k-middle is similar to trimmed mean as de ned in [9] and [18]. Let R = {r1, r2, . . . , rN } is an N element set, then the mean of k-middle, mk (R) is given by mk (R) =  1 2k 1 h+ k 1 i= h k + 1 ri, if N is odd (N = 2h 1) 1 2k h+ k i= h k + 1 ri, if N is even (N = 2h) (2) where ri is the ith element in set R and k = 1, 2, . . . , h. For k = 1, it is same as classical median, and for k = h, it is same as classical mean. C. Neighborhood Pixel Set A neighborhood pixel set RH ij associated with pixel pij I with half lter window of size H is de ned as RH ij = { pi+ k ,j + l k, l [ H, H] } (3) where, RH ij has a size of (2H + 1) (2H + 1). For example, if rn is an element in RH ij then n = 1, 2, . . . , N, where, N = (2H + 1) (2H + 1). III. PROPOSED ADAPTIVE TYPE-2 FUZZY FILTER The proposed Type-2 adaptive fuzzy lter for SAP noise removal has been discussed in this section. It has two steps. In the rst step, pixels are categorized as good or bad. Two approaches have been proposed for this categorization. Both have their own advantages. Either of them can be used. In the second step, an approach for denoising bad pixels is proposed. The schematic steps of methodology is shown in Fig. 1. Both the approaches of rst step comprise of three parts. In the rst part, set RH ij is evaluated using (3) for pixel pij . The primary MF values of Type-2 fuzzy set are evaluated for each element of RH ij in the second part. The upper membership function (UMF) and lower membership function (LMF) values of Type-2 fuzzy set are used to decide the threshold. In the third part, elements of RH ij are categorized as good and bad pixels by comparing their primary MF values with the threshold. The pixel (within lter window) having primary MF value greater than the threshold is considered as good otherwise bad. If the center pixel pij is a good pixel, then its value is retained and ltered in next iteration. If the center pixel pij is bad, then it is denoised using good pixels of RH ij in the second step that is Type-1 fuzzy set [10], [29], [30]. The two approaches for the rst step differ in design of UMF and LMF of Type-2 fuzz set. The algorithm designed for noise removal uses anyone of the two approaches. The two approaches are explained in following subsections. A. MFs With Distinct Means and Same Variance In this approach, UMF and LMF of Type-2 fuzzy set are designed to obtain a threshold that will ensure proper categorization of pixels in a window. The pixel having intensity value greater than the threshold is considered as good, whereas one with value lesser than the threshold is a bad or noisy pixel. The paper deals with SAP noise whose intensity values are either 0 or 1. Hence the pixels having intensity values pij / {0, 1} are retained. For each pixel pij {0, 1} at the location (i, j) in an image I, a lter window of size (2H + 1) (2H + 1) is considered for the evaluation of neighborhood set RH ij . The pixel pij is at the center of the window and H is its half-length. A Type-1 fuzzy set M H ij is de ned where each element rn RH ij is associated with a membership value using a Gaussian membership functions (GMF) M H i j (rn ) : RH ij [0, 1]. It is known as primary MF. The membership grade of primary MF is again a fuzzy set in the unit interval [0,1]. It is known as secondary MF. The Type-2 fuzzy set M H ij is characterized by MF M H i j (rn , M H i j ) as de ned in (1). Every element rn in the set RH ij belongs to Type-1 fuzzy set M H ij and it is associated with a GMF M ( H , k ) i j (rn ) = e (r n ( H , k ) i j )2 /2( H i j )2 . (4) The GMF parameters, Means ( (H ,k ) ij ) are varied with respect to k and Variance ( H ij ) is kept constant. They are calculated as follows: (H ,k ) ij = mk (RH ij ), k = 1, 2, 3, . . . , h (5) H ij = mh ( H ij ) (6) where, mk is the mean of k-middle and mh is the classical mean (mean of k-middle at k = h) as de ned in (2). The parameter H ij is calculated using l1 norm H ij = {|rn avg|, rn RH ij }; avg = 1 h h  k = 1 (H ,k ) ij (7) where, avg is the average mean of all the means of k-middle. The (4) (7) are described below. A neighborhood vector RH ij for a pij I of a half lter window of size H using (3) is created. Then, using (5), h different means are evaluated for all possible values of k. Using (6) and (7), H ij and H ij are evaluated. Based on the values of H ij and (H ,k ) ij , we can plot h number of GMFs for a lter window using 3172 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, OCTOBER 2018 Fig. 2. MFs with distinct Means and same Variance. (4). For example, if H = 1, then N = 9 and h = 5. Five GMFs are plotted using mean of k-middle (k = 1, 2, . . . , h) for a 3 3 window as shown in Fig. 2. Now, let ij is a matrix consisting membership values of elements rn RH ij evaluated using (4), (5), and (6). Basically, ij contains h membership values of each element of lter window corresponding to h GMFs. Hence, the size of matrix is h N and can be written as ij = M ( H , 1 ) i j (r1) M ( H , 1 ) i j (r2) M ( H , 1 ) i j (rN ) M ( H , 2 ) i j (r1) M ( H , 2 ) i j (r2) M ( H , 2 ) i j (rN ) ... ... ... ... M ( H , h ) i j (r1) M ( H , h ) i j (r2) M ( H , h ) i j (rN ) (8) A column-wise S-norm (max operation) is performed on the matrix ij followed by T-norm (min operation) on the outcomes to obtain a MF value Tm as shown in Fig. 2 for a 3 3 window. It is the minimum MF value of UMF. In the designed algorithm, Tm is used as threshold for categorizing a pixel. Mathematically, it can be expressed as Tm = ( ( ij )) (9) where, and are the min and max operators, respectively. It is adaptive in nature as compared to threshold based on Type-1 that is heuristic [9]. In the matrix ij , h number of MF values are associated with each pixel intensity. A set of MF values M H i j associated with neighborhood vector RH ij is the column-wise mean value of the matrix ij . Mathematically, it can be expressed as M H i j = h k = 1 ij h i = 1 . . . N (10) The MF value of every single pixel in lter window obtained from (10) is compared with the threshold computed in (9). If the MF value M H i j is greater than the threshold Tm , then the pixel is considered as good else bad or noisy. If the center pixel pij has MF value greater than the threshold, then it is deemed to be good for this iteration and supposed to be rechecked for denoising in the forthcoming iterations. Tu is maximum MF value of the UMF and Tl is the maximum MF value of the LMF, as shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The complete approach is given in Algorithm 1. B. MFs With Distinct Means and Variances The second approach is similar to the rst one, with only difference in determining the MF values of each pixel. The MF values are obtained Fig. 3.

Every element rn in the set RH ij belongs to fuzzy set M H ij similar to the rst approach with a GMF, M ( H , k ) i j (rn ) = e (r n ( H , k ) i j )2 /2( H i j )2 (11) Both the GMF parameters Means ( (H ,k ) ij ) and Variance ( H ij ) are varied with respect to k and are calculated as follows: (H ,k ) ij = mk (RH ij ), k = 1, 2, 3, , h (12) (H ,k ) ij = mk ( (H ,k ) ij ), k = 1, 2, 3, , h (13) where, mk is the mean of k-middle de ned in (2). The parameter H ij is de ned using l1 norm as follows: (H ,k ) ij = { |rn (H ,k ) ij |, rn RH ij } (14) The matrix ij de ned in (8) are calculated using (12), (13), and (14). The operations given in (9) and (10) are performed on matrix ij to obtain the threshold Tm and MF value M H i j for 3 3 window. They are shown in Fig. 3. The categorization of pixels are done in similar way as the rst approach as mentioned in Algorithm 1 with one change in step 8. C. Denoising Noisy Pixels Using Type-1 Fuzzy Logic The pixels categorized as bad (noisy) in step-1 are denoised in this step. The good pixels in the window play an important role in denoising the bad pixel. The selection of appropriate weights for these good pixels is very important. The Type-1 fuzzy set has been used to determine the desired weights for good pixels. The set of good pixels G is considered to be a fuzzy set and each element in it is mapped to [0, 1] by MF G . Using this approach, each pixel in the fuzzy set G has a different MF value. GMF is considered for the set of good pixels in G. First, mean of GMF is computed by applying mean of k-middle for all the good pixels in G and then an average is taken for all the k-means. The variance is found out using l1 norm of the good pixels with respect to the average mean. The MF plot for the good pixels across a 3 3 window is shown in Fig. 4. The mean of k-middle for good pixels in a particular window is computed using (2). The average mean mavg and variance G of MF G are determined as follows: mavg = h k = 1 mk h ; G = |G mavg| (15) G (gi) = e (g i m av g )2 /2 2 G (16) 3174 IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON FUZZY SYSTEMS, VOL. 26, NO. 5, OCTOBER 2018 TABLE I COMPARISON OF PERFORMANCE OF PROPOSED FILTER WITH SEVERAL STATE-OF-THE-ART ALGORITHMS [IN TERM OF PSNR (IN DECIBEL)] Dataset [28] Noise (In%) FM [21] CEF [24] PWS [23] AMEPR [19] PB [26] BDND [20] CM [27] SATV [25] IAF [9] Proposed Approaches A B Lena 20 37.05 37.46 36.85 38.21 38.31 38.52 39.42 39.20 39.92 40.75 40.79 50 29.81 30.71 29.57 33.46 32.04 32.74 33.57 33.88 34.10 34.88 34.90 80 23.11 23.22 22.68 27.16 25.97 27.11 28.45 27.14 28.84 28.92 28.89 Bridge 20 30.41 28.47 29.18 32.12 27.53 30.66 31.35 31.98 31.59 32.56 32.55 50 24.24 22.35 22.79 26.64 23.75 25.22 26.52 26.89 27.01 27.62 27.63 80 20.67 19.52 20.03 21.98 19.45 21.39 22.28 22.41 22.92 23.21 23.21 Peppers 20 36.21 35.03 35.46 37.45 36.32 34.44 37.54 36.87 37.99 41.00 41.01 50 29.53 30.38 29.26 31.25 29.25 30.23 32.03 31.62 32.34 35.17 35.14 80 22.21 23.65 22.84 27.32 25.64 26.61 27.46 26.42 27.54 29.22 29.26 Baboon 20 27.22 26.85 26.82 29.87 24.22 27.73 28.47 28.49 29.75 29.30 29.29 50 22.26 21.93 20.42 24.52 21.27 23.46 24.05 23.91 24.84 24.59 24.60 80 18.69 17.60 17.86 19.73 17.38 19.92 20.36 20.59 20.73 20.79 20.81 Barbara 20 29.46 29.58 28.72 29.72 29.24 29.85 30.78 30.70 31.95 33.22 33.20 50 23.46 23.37 22.69 25.33 23.49 25.17 26.10 25.91 26.74 28.24 28.26 80 19.35 19.31 18.91 21.41 21.64 21.74 22.54 22.66 22.78 23.82 23.81 Boat 20 34.75 30.87 33.78 34.89 32.73 34.83 35.31 35.97 36.03 36.67 36.62 50 27.96 25.65 26.80 29.34 27.83 29.68 29.99 30.38 30.69 31.39 31.38 80 23.65 21.46 22.50 24.75 22.29 24.93 25.58 25.18 25.88 26.23 26.26 House 20 37.84 37.91 37.74 37.42 37.45 37.23 38.32 38.66 38.97 47.48 47.54 50 29.45 29.52 29.49 31.51 30.70 31.72 32.45 32.53 33.19 39.90 39.88 80 22.65 22.63 22.54 25.45 24.84 25.81 27.52 26.16 27.82 32.04 32.01 The values in bold represent better PSNR as compared to several state-of-the-art algorithms.

Finally, the denoised pixel intensity pnew is computed in (17). pnew =  g i G wigi W ; W =  i= 1 wi (17) wi G is the weight corresponding to the ith good pixel, is the number of good pixels in a lter window, and W is the normalizing term. In case of high noise level, there is a chance that (Cardinality of GH ij ) will become zero. In such cases, H is increased by 1 and the whole process is repeated. If the deviation G is below a very small threshold , i.e., the window consists of pixels with intensities very near to that of pij , then the value of pij is simply replaced by mavg. This will restrict the division by zero that may arise due to uniform intensity and make G zero. D.

RESULTS AND VALIDATIONS The proposed lter has been used for removing SAP noise from seven standard grayscale images of resolution 512 512 [28]. The images considered are Baboon, Barbara, Boat, Bridge, House, Lena, and Peppers. The validations were carried out on a system with In- tel Core i7, 3.2 Ghz processor and 8 GB RAM. The performance of proposed lter has been compared with various state-of-the-art algo- rithms. For all these images, the parameter k is varied form 1, 2, . . . , h in both the approaches of step 1 of lter to compute the mean and variance. The MFs are plotted for both the approaches to decide re- spective threshold. The threshold is adaptive in nature that depends on SAP noise level. The SAP noise level is varied from 20% to 99%. For comparative analysis, the results for three different noise levels viz. 20%, 50%, and 80% are shown in Table I. For the noise level of 97%, the results are shown (Fig. 8) with the images of Lena, Baboon, House, and Peppers. The lter operation at noise level of 98% and 99% are tested only for peppers. The proposed approaches preserve signi cant image details even for 99% of noise level (shown in Fig. 8). To perform the experimentation, we have set a minimum number of good pixel ( min) as 1 in lter window to estimate the pixel intensity of bad pixels. This is because a large number of good pixels are required for denois- ing bad pixel. Having m in more than 1, the results are poor for high noise level. The performance of proposed approaches are numerically evaluated using PSNR. The PSNR is de ned using ltered image (If ) with respect to original image (Io) as follows: PSNR(Io, If ) = 10log10 2552 1 X Y  i,j (Io(i, j) If (i, j))2 (19) where, 255 is the maximum pixel intensity of 8-bit images. Table I shows the performance of proposed approaches A and B with respect to various state-of-the-art algorithms, namely, iterative adaptive fuzzy lter (IAF) [9], adaptive median with edge-preserving regularization (AMEPR) [19], boundary discriminative noise detection (BDND) [20], fast median (FM) [21], wavelet neural network [22], pixel-wise S-estimate of variance (PWS) [23], contrast enhancement based lter (CEF) [24], spatially adaptive total variation lter (SATV) [25], patch-based (PB) [26], and the cloud model (CM) lter [27].

With the increase in noise level, the lter window size increases. For large windows, more MF s are drawn to compute the threshold. The computational time is relatively higher in such cases. V. CONCLUSION This paper proposes a novel adaptive Type-2 fuzzy lter for removing SAP noise from grayscale images. The use of either of the two proposed approaches in rst step of fuzzy lter detects noisy pixels in the lter window. In the subsequent step, the proposed weighted mean Type-1 fuzzy approach denoises bad pixels in the respective lter window. The proposed approach is validated on several grayscale images. The experimental results show that proposed lter outperforms other state- of-the-art algorithms. Moreover, the lter preserves meaningful image details even at noise level as high as 99%.
